2023,C,69.75,185,,,1,Connor Bedard,"Bedard is a potential franchise-changing No. 1 prospect. His skill and shot are legit game-breaking attributes. His ability to beat defenders one-on-one is among the best I've ever seen by a 17-year-old, and the pace at which he displays that elite skill is going to allow him to execute those types of skilled plays in the NHL. Bedard is a highly imaginative puckhandler and a very creative passer. That, combined with the fact his wrist shot is a top-tier NHL weapon from anywhere in the offensive zone, makes him a projected nightmare for NHL coaches to stop on the power play. The only downside to his game is his frame, which has some scouts wondering if he gets pushed off to the wing in the NHL. He isn't a pushover though, as he plays hard and has a physical edge in his game. Given his success as a junior center, his strong skating and his high compete level, I think whoever drafts him will have to try him down the middle and move to the wing if it doesn't work. If he is a wing, he could still have a potential Patrick Kane/Nikita Kucherov type of impact on a franchise.","Bedard’s statistical profile speaks for itself: 28 points in 15 games as a 15-year-old in the WHL, two points per game at U18 worlds as a double underager, 51 goals and 100 points on a dreadful team at 16, six goals in four games at U18 worlds as an underager for a second time (in what wasn’t even his best hockey), 13 goals and 31 points in 14 world juniors games (after forcing his way onto the first of those three teams by torching the selection camp), and then, as a 17-year-old who won’t turn 18 until July (we can almost forget that!), a 100-goal draft year as the CHL’s leader in goals per game, assists per game, points per game and shots per game.

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Bedard can do things with the puck that nobody else in the sport can replicate. I’m not talking about him compared to other prospects in this draft. I’m talking nobody. As in, you could put him on the ice with the world’s best shooters and they wouldn’t be able to load up just off of their lead skate and fire it off balance like he does, or drop it into their feet and let it go like he does. He’s got one of the best shooting actions in motion I’ve ever seen.

The way the puck explodes off of his blade almost without any forward motion to indicate the shot’s coming is remarkable. While that bent-sideways cannon that he has off of his right hip is his defining quality, it’s not the only tool he has that is singular, either. In fact, it’s not even the only element of his shooting arsenal that is one of one. His release is lightning-quick. There’s the pinpoint accuracy from impossible angles. There are the little delays and stutters he uses to create separation and get to his spots. There’s his variety of shooting stances (right down to his curl-and-drag, his one-timer, and his feel off of his backhand).

He’s got everything else you look for in a dynamic play creator as well. He’s got unbelievably quick hands and the loose grip that all great handlers have. He’s got high-end speed with his galloping crossover strides and strong acceleration from a standstill, which help him carry the puck up the ice, create one-on-one off the rush, or join in transition as the trailer whenever he has to play catchup.

He’s also highly creative despite his goal-scoring tilt. Even though the goalie is his focus, I wouldn’t say he tunnel-visions, and there’s a lot to his game between the offensive-zone blue line and the shot he takes that’s inventive. He has also learned to use the attention his shot gets as a tool to open up his passing game and find linemates at the backdoor with blind passes through seams. He regularly makes difficult plays as a passer, demonstrating high-end spatial awareness and often finding second or even third options (constantly pre-scanning and shoulder-checking). He’s an entry machine driving play through the neutral zone and across the line in control. He goes to the front of the net and will bail out to make effort plays. Add in instincts off the puck to get open even when he’s a marked man, an improved physical engagement (he’s really quite feisty and competitive), some underrated skill as a puck thief, a strong lower half, and you’ve got a superstar prospect. Nobody can defend his inside-out cut into that low, hard wrister of his at the junior level. It often takes two to take the puck off of him when he’s twisting and turning, too.

He’s a marvel, with legit 50-goal upside at the next level. I think he’ll stick at centre, too (it was nice to see him at 53.6 percent in the circle this year). I’m not sure there has ever been a player Connor Bedard’s age in the history of hockey who has been able to shoot the puck like he can. He can get a little ahead of the play, and he’s got work to do on his game defensively if he doesn’t want to get hemmed in at the next level, but those are things you live with when it comes to talent as singular as his.","Connor Bedard is an extremely gifted generational offensive talent. Whichever team is lucky enough to have the lottery balls fall their way will be sprinting to the podium on June 28th to draft Bedard. Bedard’s innate scoring ability is one that we haven’t seen in along time, and I could see Bedard as a challenger for the 50-goal mark in most seasons he is not hampered by injury. Chicago won’t be challenging for a Stanley Cup in the next couple years, and the continuous losing may spark a commitment to the defensive side of the game for him, like we saw with Connor McDavid a few seasons back. ","One of the most naturally gifted goal scorers to enter the draft, Bedard is so much more than a shooter. His offensive intelligence and vision are standout traits which maximize his offensive output. He exploits defenses with higher-end puck skills to create more space and then can finish plays with precision that so few players are capable in this age group. In the NHL, you have to finish your best chances. Bedard finishes the ones he’s supposed to and the ones you can’t expect most players to make. The shot is as good as I’ve ever seen at this level. It’s quick, accurate and he can get it off from anywhere in any way, with unmatched precision. 

Bedard is by no means a perfect prospect. At his size he can sometimes get outmuscled and shut down, but he doesn’t back down from physical challenges and has gotten better at asserting himself and playing the body. His skating is good, but not at an elite level to create separation, which is why his hands and creativity have become a big part of his game and how he creates offense. None of the flaws or limitations he has have held him back in any meaningful way at other levels, and I don’t anticipate they will in the NHL either. 

There are few players that come along where you think every time they have the puck, something is going to happen. Bedard is one. He is a threat every time he hops over the boards.",,"Connor Bedard is the premier prospect in the world. He has done the unthinkable time and time again over his junior career and will continue that feat in the NHL soon. An electric finisher who blends dynamic skating, exquisite handling, vision, and determination. He’s not the biggest player, but he’ll be a big-time player. This is a generational talent who will change the face of the Chicago Blackhawks.",,
2023,C,74,187,,,2,Adam Fantilli,"There's so much to love about Fantilli's NHL projection. He’s got a huge frame, skates well and competes very hard. He wins a lot of battles and isn't shy to use his big frame to lay out opponents. He has game-breaking puck skills and will be able to beat NHL opponents regularly with his puckhandling, especially given his speed and wingspan. His playmaking isn't the main thing that gets you excited about his game, but Fantilli can make difficult passes and has strong enough sense to create chances in the NHL. His shot is also a threat from range. That he can create with so much pace is what makes him exciting from an NHL perspective. He checks every box and projects as a No. 1 center on a good NHL team.","Fantilli is a big, strong, powerful center who takes pucks from the wall to the interior with force, ease and speed — the kind of player every team covets. He can beat you along the wall on the cycle. He can beat you carrying the puck in rotations around the perimeter of the offensive zone. He can beat you by pushing through lanes to the middle third, driving the net, or dropping a shoulder to take space that isn’t there. He can beat you flying out wide. He has regularly blown me away in viewings these last couple of years (at Hockey Canada’s showcase two summers ago, in games where he looked like a man among boys in the USHL, and again at various points throughout his historic, Hobey Baker-winning freshman year at Michigan).

And even at 6-foot-2 and about 195 pounds, he’s one of the best skaters in this draft. It’s not often we see players his size who can move like him. His skating is balanced. It’s powerful when it needs to be and light and adjustable when it needs to be. Within his movement patterns, he can handle the puck on a string and shade opposing defenders off his hip. He’s going to be a transition monster. On top of it all, he’s physical, he’s a fiery competitor, he’ll get after it on forecheck and track pucks, he plays with energy, and he’ll pounce on turnovers and be opportunistic. He can score from midrange consistently with his low-kick wrister and one-timer, he’s got an ability to protect the puck in and out of coverage, he’s got a dangerous curl-and-drag wrister, and he’s comfortable in traffic. When he’s on, he can completely take over a game.

He also shed some of the force-it plays this year that could frustrate me and others at lower levels (he made better decisions on shot selection, overhandled less, and utilized his linemates better). I think he’s going to play in the NHL next year and be successful on raw ability from the jump. And I wasn’t deterred from that belief by his low point totals at men’s worlds. Once he refines and rounds out his game some more and adds more muscle as he ages, watch out.","Adam Fantilli has every tool that an NHL team would dream of having with their top overall selection. He’s got the physical tools of size, strength, speed and lateral mobility. He has amazing puck skill with the ability to do it at full speed and in small area situations. He can protect the puck, put his shoulder down and power through a defender, or put it under a defender’s stick and put them through the spin cycle.

His vision is high-end with the ability to find lateral teammates and move defenders out of passing lanes to open up new scoring opportunities. He has a heavy wrist shot and a dynamite one-timer.  The power play could run through Fantilli or he could be the trigger man. ","A 6-foot-2, 200-pound power center with touch, Fantilli is the kind of player teams are desperate for–skilled size. While the league continues to go more towards skill, players that have size, strength, physicality and speed will always get longer looks than their smaller counterparts. In Fantilli’s case, he’s also one of the best offensive performers in this draft class.

With powerful, quick skating, Fantilli gets up and down the ice as well as anyone. He’s hard to move off pucks and difficult to slow down in transition. If you time your check right, you have to hope he’s not going to bowl you over. There’s an aggressiveness and tenacity in Fantilli’s game that can overpower the opposition and lead to him winning a lot of battles and one-on-one plays. He’s most dangerous around the net and he gets there with regularity. His ability to drive to the middle of the ice may be one of his biggest separating factors among other centers in this class. Meanwhile, he’s producing at a near historic rate in his first NCAA season, drawing comparisons to Jack Eichel’s incredible freshman campaign in his own draft season.

Fantilli has the skill to make a ton of plays. Sometimes I question his puck decisions and forcing plays to the middle when they’re not there, but he has good reason to be confident in his ability. The size, the speed and the skill make Fantilli one of the draft’s premier players and, as we wrote not so long ago, way more than a consolation prize.",,"A fantastic consolation prize, Adam Fantilli would be the first overall selection in many years. A power centre with the ability to score from distance, matchup against skill, and drive play into the middle of the ice. Plus, he’s a serious weapon on the man advantage. This is a draft-and-play asset.",,
2023,RW,70,148,,,3,Matvei Michkov,"Michkov is one of the very best first-year draft eligibles I've ever seen from inside the offensive blue line. He has truly special offensive skill and hockey sense. His mind operates differently from other players in how he sees the play develop and he always seems to find ways to figure into scoring chances despite not being the biggest or fastest. His mind is special, but he's freakishly skilled with the puck too, and can make elite stickhandling plays seem routine. He can make plays at a high level, but Michkov is a finisher who will score a lot of goals as a pro. His skating is more elusive than fast and I wouldn't call him a high-compete type either. He’s signed in the KHL through the 2025-26 season, but he projects as a game-breaking elite scoring winger in the NHL.","Michkov is the best Russian prospect since Alex Ovechkin and Evgeni Malkin back in 2004. On talent, upside and pedigree, his game checks all three boxes. The combination of Michkov’s position (NHL teams definitely think twice when drafting wingers this high) and the increasing uncertainty around Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and his contract in the KHL with SKA could complicate where he goes on draft day, but he still belongs here. And despite suffering a lower-body injury in a KHL preseason game, Michkov (who played to a goal a game last year in the MHL) played to a goal a game in Russia’s second-tier VHL and was extremely productive for his age after the move to Sochi in the KHL (he actually led a lowly Sochi team in scoring in his time there).

If he were a little more committed off the puck (which I’m not as critical of as some others), and an inch or two taller, he’d have a near-perfect profile for me. He’s different than Bedard in tools and approach. Michkov’s brilliance comes primarily from his ability to make his decisions quickly and execute on them with incredible proficiency, whether that’s ripping a patterned shot (his one-timer, his standstill wrister, his curl-and-drag, etc.), a flash of his unbelievable hands, a quick move into a pass, a sudden stop-up, or an attacking cut.

But he’s also sturdy for his size, which allows him to extend plays when he needs to, hang onto pucks when a quick attack isn’t there, or delay for his linemates. And while he shines in moments more than long stretches of dominant play or prolonged carries, those short moments and the consistency of his execution within them (despite being freakishly talented, he makes very few mistakes with the puck) create a uniquely high-reward, somehow low-risk game despite his tendency to come and go. When he tries things — and he often does — he’s never trying them out of desperation but rather intention. He’s a rare kind of player where he’s got A-grade tools across the board but he’s also got an efficiency to his attacking that is incredibly rare for a skilled player (especially one his age). He’s not the hardest-working player defensively, nor the fastest skater, but he always seems to be lurking around the play (and the puck) anyway and his skill level pops from there. I expect him to crack games open at the NHL level and while he’s not going to be a driver, per se, I don’t think he’ll fade either because he doesn’t need time or space to attack and he’s a threat as soon as the puck touches his stick (similar to Nikita Kucherov).","A smart, dynamic goal-scoring winger, Michkov dictates play when he’s on the ice. With constant delays and changes of pace, baiting poke-checks to freeze defenders just enough to get by them, making up for his lack of a high-end top speed. Making give-and-go plays all along the ice, using his teammates effectively, he’s not afraid to turn back in transition in order to maintain possession and open up new opportunities. He finds open ice extremely well and always positions himself to be a great passing option in the offensive zone. All this is designed with the end goal of creating space for himself in dangerous areas to let his lethal shot fly. He may look small, but he’s not easily knocked over, and he doesn’t shy away from physical battles; his physical game has improved a lot over the course of the season as he’s gotten stronger, and it should improve even more from here. There are flashes of great playmaking ability, but it’s not consistent; his ideas and vision are great, but the execution is often poor. Overall, since moving teams, he’s been playing a much more projectable game, and not trying to do everything himself so much, which was an issue before, as well as playing a much better defensive game, though it’s still not a strength of his. He has the potential to be a game-breaking talent, but it’s not a guarantee, although I’m less concerned than I previously was. ","For the last few years, I’ve described Michkov as a genius-level hockey player. His sense for the game is among the best I’ve seen since I’ve been evaluating prospects. Bedard might be the best goal scorer, but Michkov is not terribly far behind. What makes Michkov special is that he’s always thinking a step ahead. He uses his creativity to find space, but just about everything he does is intentional and net-driven. The quickness with which he figures out how he needs to get open or how he can best position a shot is at an elite level. In addition to processing the game at such a high rate, Michkov also has the hands, and the shot, to execute with precision.

Currently playing in Russia’s second pro division, Michkov is averaging a goal per game. For as good a player as he is, he still lacks the strength and quickness to be as effective at the KHL level as everywhere else he’s been. That will come eventually, though, as he gets stronger. This is also what makes his hockey sense special, because he knows how to maximize what he is physically capable of and can outthink his bigger, stronger opponents.

Whatever team drafts Michkov knows they probably will not see him until the 2026-27 season at the earliest, which creates inherent risk in the pick and changes the dynamic of the decision-making process. This isn’t simply a hockey decision anymore. But you can also ask the Minnesota Wild if Kirill Kaprizov was worth the wait. A team that is confident in their ability to get him signed when his KHL deal expires as well as one that has the ability to be patient has a chance to get one of the best Russian prospects since Alex Ovechkin and Evgeni Malkin went 1-2 in the 2004 NHL Draft.",,"Statistically, Matvei Michkov is *another* first overall level prospect. The manner in which he produced in the KHL this season is the stuff of legend. A shooter who has never met a puck or a situation that he didn’t lean into. He’s developed a highly advanced playmaking arsenal as well. The 5-foot-11 winger’s biggest knock is his birth certificate and contract status. His offensive upside is second only to Bedard.",,
2023,C,75,194,,,4,Leo Carlsson,"Carlsson has elite skill, which when combined with his frame and a strong motor, has allowed him to be a very good player in a great league as a draft eligible. Carlsson routinely shows the ability to beat pro defenders with skill. He gets a ton of chances in the high-percentage areas, both due to his hands and his willingness to attack the net. He's an excellent playmaker as well with a very imaginative offensive mind who can run a pro power play and often played the flank in the SHL on the man advantage. His only drawback is a lack of true separation speed. I've seen worse feet on a 6-foot-3 guy, but he won't be turning NHL defensemen around. He's mostly played wing the last two years but has enough experience at center and the traits to play the middle that I could see him become a legit No. 1 center in the NHL with star upside.","Though he doesn’t play the game with some of the shine of the three players in front of him, Carlsson had a tremendous age-adjusted season between his play with Orebro in the SHL (including in the playoffs), at the world juniors (where he was one of Sweden’s top forwards despite playing sick/banged up), and then for the senior men’s national team for the first time (a team he is now the youngest player to ever score for), even considering his December 2004 birthday. This all came a year after playing to virtually two points per game at the J20 level (he looked good in an important role as a top-nine centre for Sweden at U18 worlds before an injury kept him out of their medal-round run to a gold medal, too).

Carlsson’s a big kid who has begun to come into his body (he’s 6-foot-3 and 198 pounds), but he’s also got slick handling and finesse for a forward his size, regularly finding his way through traffic or around it by out-waiting defenders one-on-one in shielded puck protection off of his hip. He stays on pucks, he’s got great instincts and takes smart routes around the ice, he’s sound positionally, he applies pressure off of the puck and comes up with possession despite not being very physical, and he just always seems to be involved in positive things inside the offensive zone. His skating also continues to improve (he’s not fast, but he’s an above-average skater for his size by my measure and it shouldn’t be preventative in him reaching his NHL upside). His long stick can limit him catching and handling pucks in his feet at times, and he doesn’t have a great shot, but those things should come, he’s got soft hands and standout finesse skill as a passer, and he’s got great dexterity and reflexes all told.

Carlsson’s also one of the smartest players in the draft and understands spacing and timing on and off the puck at an advanced level for his age. And while he played almost exclusively as a winger in the SHL the last two seasons, Carlsson came up as a centre and I like the way his game might fit there long term because of his combination of size, detail, talent and awareness. He projects as a pass-first playmaking centre with a middle-six floor, first-line potential, and clear PP value (in multiple roles, too, because he’s great around the net and below the goal line passing low to high, but can also run it from the flank).","Carlsson has been played extremely well at the SHL level this season for Örebro. In the offensive zone, he will take over the cycle and will move laterally quickly to shift away from pressure as he sees that if he moves laterally he will skate into a quality passing lane that he can exploit. Carlsson’s vision and stick-handling can get him out of well-pressured jams in all three zones. He will find quality passing lanes in the neutral zone when looking for a teammate in stride to pass to and has no issue with maneuvering the puck around tight pressure. Carlsson hunts for loose pucks with speed and has the physicality to deliver quality checks along the boards to cause puck disruption in tight board battles. Carlsson is a prospect that we see being a reliable playmaker and playing in a line one role at the NHL level. ","The buzz is growing (and rightfully so) that Carlsson belongs in the top-tier of this draft, or at least deserves to be spoken in the same sentence as Bedard, Michkov and Fantilli. Carlsson has all of the measurable qualities teams look for in a power forward, but he’s shown very early on in this SHL season that he’s got the game to go along with it. He’s been scoring at an extraordinarily high-rate for a U19 player in Sweden’s top pro league, while averaging top-six minutes and showing an ability to drive play.

At 6-foot-3, 194, he’s a solidly-built forward who is difficult to move off pucks and has good net-drive ability. Carlsson also has soft-touch skills with the puck and makes confident decisions when he has it on his stick. Off the puck, he competes and is responsible at both ends of the ice. He might not have the outright offensive creativity of the three players ahead of him, but he has good hands and good touch on the puck, which makes him extra dangerous in tight.",,"Oh, look, another first-overall talent. Leo Carlsson shone brightly against the best professionals in Sweden. The 6-foot-3 centre boasts all of the traits you look for in a front-line pivot. Won’t wow you constantly, but does everything very well. Big, strong, quick, skilled. We like him a lot.",,
2023,LW,69.75,170,,,5,Zach Benson,"Benson has a ton of creativity and offense in his game. He makes high-end skill plays routinely, he's one of the better passers in junior and projects to be a major asset on an NHL power play. Benson lacks ideal size at 5-foot-9, but he's relentless in puck battles often coming out with the puck despite his frame. He's a responsible, detailed defensive player who is an asset without the puck. His frame, combined with a lack of separation speed, is a concern, though, for his NHL projection even though he's got good quickness in tight. There is a fair amount of risk on his projection, but his strong compete and tremendous skill plus track record of scoring, makes you think there is still a very good chance he can become a quality top-six wing in the NHL.","There were a lot of nights last season, on an Ice team that boasted half a dozen of the better forwards and two of the top defencemen in the WHL, where this kid was the best player on the ice (which included him leading them in scoring in the playoffs with 23 points in 15 games) as a 16-year-old. And this season there’s no doubt: Though an injury kept him out of the first round of the playoffs and allowed teammate Matt Savoie to really take over in the postseason, Benson was the best forward on arguably the CHL’s most talented team at forward this year.

And while he benefits from playing with talented linemates, Benson’s a driver in every sense. He’s a multi-dimensional forward who has quick acceleration, can handle the puck at speed and change tempos in control, can shape play by opening up his hips to go heel-to-heel, thrives in traffic, is a triple shot-deke-pass threat, plays one step ahead of the game in possession, supports the play effectively, problem-solves as well as anyone in this class (in an age group that is full of intelligent playmakers), works hard off the puck to keep his energy up (he plays heavier and scrappier than he looks, too), and sets the pace and effort level for his line (whether by picking it up or slowing it down to use his creativity).

He’s the kind of player who fills the stat sheet and elevates his linemates in subtle ways. Increasingly, I’ve been impressed by his agility in and out of breaks and cuts (his skating is an almost underrated asset for him and particularly impressive through his edges and crossovers, though he can get going the length of the ice, too). He’ll make plays to the inside from the perimeter on one shift, and then go right to the guts of the ice to make something happen in a congested area the next. When you package all of that skill with a dogged work ethic that keeps him around pucks all the time, you’ve got a tremendous player. If he were a little bigger, he’d be a scout’s dream. I think he’s going to be a top-of-the-lineup player regardless.","While I don’t necessarily see Zach Benson reaching the top of the superstar bucket, (Tavares, Kane, Stamkos etc…) I do envision him being a cornerstone piece for the franchise that selects him this June.

When thinking of a player comparison, I get drawn to a few different players. From an offensive skills standpoint, I personally see a lot of similar traits to Cole Perfetti. Great vision, feet always moving, and just very technically sound with every movement. Benson has a motor on him though that never stops running. To me, very similar to watching Brayden Point roam around. There just seems to always be a certain intensity when both of them are on the ice and hunting down pucks. Both great at carving out pockets of space, and tremendous at distributing or finishing plays themselves. ","An offensive dynamo with deft scoring touch, Benson has been a key player for one of the best teams in all of junior hockey over the last two seasons. Surrounded by talent, Benson continues to stand out as a play-driver with a strong finish. In this draft with a lot of bigger players, Benson stands out in other ways, especially his offensive intelligence and ability to execute consistently. The primary concern about a player of Bensons' size is his skating. It’s fine, but could be better in order to calm some of the concerns about his size. 

What alleviates the skating concern for me is how quickly Benson processes the game and his commitment to playing aggressive off the puck and in pursuit. He takes a lot of pucks off opposing players in a given game. That competitive drive that he has on top of the ability to make a ton of plays during a game should allow him to continue to be an impact player as he progresses up the ranks.",,"Some people are worried about selecting a 5-9 forward without blazing speed at this juncture of the draft. I’m not one of them. Zach Benson has the highest work rate in the class. He boasts high-end puck skills and a plus-rated release. His playmaking is ultra-supreme. This is a worker bee with first-line skills. Sure, he may have to move to the flank, but we still bet on these types of guys.",,
2023,C,71.75,180,,,6,William Smith,"Smith is a dynamic offensive player who stands out every game with his talent. He has tremendous puck skills, vision and overall offensive creativity and projects to be a major asset on an NHL power play. He skates well and makes so many high-difficulty plays at a strong pace, which lends well to his pro projection. Smith is a high-end passer who is also able to finish chances from the dots. The only real wart in his game is I wouldn’t call him an overly physical or high-energy player. I don't think he lacks effort. He's around the puck a ton whenever he's on the ice and even at times killed penalties for the program.","A brilliant handler and manipulator of the puck, including at full speed, Smith is a tantalizing and slippery talent who blends deception, baits and fakes (with his eyes, shoulders and head) into his movements to not just make opposing players miss but often send them the wrong way.

Crafty is the best word to describe his game. He went from a point-per-game U17 season (the only player on that team to do so) to more than two points per game in his U18 campaign. Beyond his natural skill in possession, he also impresses with his smarts with the puck, his cerebral play style, and his ability to play to his linemates. Smith is one of the very best slot passers in the draft and uses his unique puckhandling ability to dodge close-outs, weave off of the wall (he almost always takes his first touch to the middle as a tool to draw attention), and make plays through holes in coverage in possession with ease, regularly hanging onto pucks to delay his way into his spots or carve in.

He’s the kind of player who can beat you with a pass, a dangerous wrister (which beats goalies with timing and accuracy more than power), or a deke. He’s a treat to watch in possession and processes the game at such an advanced and rapid level.

The way he wheels across the top of the circles and then play-makes from the high slot, or slips off the wall to the middle, is special. The way he walks through coverage and hangs onto pucks is special. He’s just so hard to get a hand on. There’s just this elusiveness to his game where you never know where he’s going with the puck. I like the way he has started to hunt and come up with more pucks, too.

He still has some work to do to round out his game (he’s a little too eager to flee the zone at times, isn’t very physically engaged, and can try to do a little too much occasionally). But his tracking on steals has become a borderline strength (I quite like him on stick lifts). And you can live with the rest. I’ll be shocked if he doesn’t become a playmaking top-six centre and PP1 creator. I expect him to become a big-time point producer and I nearly ranked him fourth here.","What makes Will Smith so tantalizing as a prospect is when he has the puck on his stick in the offensive zone. His ability to maneuver around defenders and retain control of the puck and maintain perfect balance in small areas makes him a human highlight reel. He has a great wrist shot, and is able to thread passes and create passing lanes at an elite level. He never was the dominant puck transporter on his line, and his defensive engagement level wasn’t high end even to finish the year. While I question if he sticks at center in the NHL, there is no denying he has one of the highest offensive potentials in the draft. ","Averaging over two points per game so far this season, Smith is not quite at the same pace that Jack Hughes scored at during his U18 season with the NTDP, but he’s not far off either. With elite puck skills and the creativity to open up space for himself and others, Smith has turned himself into one of the premier playmakers in this draft class. 

He processes the game at a remarkable pace, which allows him to play faster than many of his peers, even if he's not an explosive skater. He’s the kind of player that can make something out of nothing and makes everyone around him better. Smith needs to tack on more muscle to be a bit tougher to knock off pucks, but he is having a very special season that has his stock skyrocketing.",,"Will Smith is one of the most talented playmakers and point producers in the class. His statistical output with the USNTDP this past season surpassed all previous members of the illustrious U18 franchise. The only player to score more than his 127 points was linemate, Gabe Perreault. There are some issues to work out away from the puck, but you can manage that when considering his upside.",,
2023,C,73,200,,,7,Dalibor Dvorsky,"Dvorsky is quite dangerous inside the offensive zone. He has excellent puck skills in small areas and can make checkers miss routinely in open ice. He can make tough plays and find seams. He excels as a goal scorer, though, with a wrist shot and one-timer that he can often finish from range. Dvorsky's compete is good, he wins puck battles and he isn't shy from using his body. Like a lot of shooters he can stay too much on the perimeter instead of taking it to the net, but I never watch his games and think he lacks effort. His footspeed is going to be an issue for higher levels. I think with his offensive talent, his work ethic and strong and consistent track record of scoring he finds a way to become a very important part of an NHL lineup, but I'm less sure of whether he sticks down the middle or has to be a winger due to his skating.","The next in a long line of top Slovak prospects over the last couple of years, Dvorsky’s June birthday makes him one of the younger players on this list and he has already accomplished a lot, including leading a Slovak Hlinka Gretzky Cup team that featured Juraj Slafkovsky and Filip Mesar in scoring as an underager, producing well above a point per game in Sweden’s J20 level last year, producing at a strong age-adjusted clip in his draft year in the second-tier HockeyAllsvenskan (while clicking at two points per game in stints back down at J20 when the schedule allowed), and driving the bus on a Slovak team that was thin up front but exceeded expectations in Switzerland at this year’s U18 worlds.

The big question with Dvorsky for a while was whether or not he’d be a centre or a winger long term. This season, after noticeably adding some muscle, a little more speed (I’m not worried about his skating), and rounding out his game nicely, I think he has shown folks that he’ll be able to stick down the middle.

He’s sound positionally defensively. He uses his body to gain inside positioning on defenders and shields pucks effectively. I no longer have concerns about his skating (he did not look slow in the second half of this year, and began to show more consistently at five-on-five across levels as a result). He has also shown a little more fire. His gifts in control of the puck are real (I actually found it weird that he became cast as a high-floor 200-foot player as his draft year progressed, because while his energy and detail are certainly strengths, I see legitimate finesse skills, point-production upside and power-play tools). He can run the wall or the point on the PP, effortlessly picking coverage apart and feathering pucks through seams. He’s got excellent touch and weight on his passes (he’s a great saucer passer off of his forehand and backhand, in particular), and does a beautiful job waiting for lanes to open. He trusts his one-timer and his wrister from midrange. He’s got quick hands and instincts, with standout puck control and shading — and he uses them to take pucks to the middle. I like him in give-and-gos and in individual attacking sequences inside the offensive zone.

Dvorsky is a highly talented and intelligent playmaker who can threaten coverage in a variety of ways, whether that’s carving through it in control and finishing cleanly from the home plate area, sliding off of coverage to find pockets of space to get open into, or drawing coverage and facilitating (he does a wonderful job hanging onto pucks and waiting for options to open). He’ll occasionally force things but he usually finds his way through with his skill, strength on pucks and smarts. His statistical profile is really strong and continued progress in his skating will keep it that way into the NHL. I expect he’ll be picked a little lower than this, but I still like him at the edge of the top 10.","Dalibor Dvorsky had an up and down draft year. He’s a big, strong center with two-way capability and a super high motor. The way he approaches the game at both ends of the ice should allow for him to adapt to the NHL style quickly and be fairly effective early on. In the defensive end, he gets low to support his teammates. He’s aggressive and tenacious, not shy to use his strength to fight for inside ice and win puck battles. He forces attackers to make quick decisions and capitalizes on mistakes. Dvorsky has some playmaking ability, however his strongest weapon offensively is his shot. He has a lightning quick release and can generate serious power. If he can hone in on his accuracy, he has the ability to be a goal scoring threat. There are certainly questions about just how high his ceiling is, but he’s a workhorse who can drive play at both ends.","The latest top Slovak prospect amid a bit of a hockey renaissance for Slovakia, Dvorsky has a remarkable track record for a player so young. After starting the season in Sweden’s U20 ranks, he was quickly called up to the second pro division and has been producing consistently while getting middle-six minutes. Dvorsky can score, and the fact he’s doing it with relative ease this season is notable. The 17-year-old appeared in 17 Allsvenskan games last season, producing three points. He doubled that total within his first seven games in 2022-23. 

Off the puck, Dvorsky still needs a lot of work and there are still times where he can disappear from games. That said, he’s got excellent offensive instincts, he puts himself in good positions to score, and he’s been on a fairly aggressive development curve from a young age. He gets better every year. ",,"A true matchup centre prospect that lives in the middle of the ice and generates the vast majority of his chances from the net front and low-slot area. Dalibor Dvorský’s stock has continued to rise thanks to his pro-frame, north-south style, and impressive international showings.",,
2023,RW,71.75,190,,,8,Ryan Leonard,"Leonard is a versatile winger with a lot of elements to his game that an NHL coach will covet. He’s a strong skater who competes very well, with a direct style of play and despite an average-sized frame he has a lot of physicality in his game. He combines that with excellent hands and an ability to make highly skilled plays with the puck at full speed. His playmaking isn't great but there's vision and finishing ability in his game to score at higher levels. Leonard may never truly stand out at either end of the ice, but he will never give a coach a reason to sit him and projects as a quality top-six wing.","Leonard is a prospect that everyone likes. It’s impossible not to. And after how good he looked as an underager at U18 worlds in Germany last April, nobody has been surprised by his near goal-per-game breakout this season (in fact, I wrote “I won’t be surprised if he challenges Smith and Moore on the stat sheet this year while providing all of the energy that he does” in my preseason ranking).

He’s a versatile, powerful, high-RPM player who makes things happen when he’s on the ice and pulls teammates into the fight with his scrappy, competitive, never-stop style. He’s not just the energy guy though, either. He’s got really quick side-to-side hands, a hard shot that rattles off of his stick, and quick crossover patterns that allow him to use those hands to get to places where he can look to shoot. Add in the strength and power that comes with his stocky frame, an ability to drive and shed contact when he gets bumped, and a defensive conscience, and there’s more than just a hands-shot-worker skill set. He’s not the most cerebral player and he can be a little too net-focused at times, but he has made noticeable strides on both of those fronts to become a more inventive, less predictable player from A to B (I’ve been more and more impressed by his little hesitations and his widened vision in possession). His backhand has also become a legit weapon, adding another layer to his shooting arsenal. There’s just so much that looks translatable about his game. The way he gets shots off hard even from off balance and sometimes falling stances. The way he battles and the fearlessness with which he drives the net. His dexterity.

Leonard’s the kind of player who will score, add physicality to a line, and slide up and down a top nine in an NHL lineup while endearing himself to his coaches.","I see Leonard as a winger who can provide teams with top six goal scoring production at the next level. He’s also got grit to him and will use it rather effectively behind the red line in the offensive zone.

He doesn’t have the toolsy flashy handling to dance around pressure that is Kent Johnson or Mitch Marner like, but he’s got tools on his tool-belt to evade the pressure and create separation for himself.

But, I’d like to see Leonard start to come up with plan B or plan C strategies when he has committed to driving the puck to net front. NHL defensemen will start to pick up on Leonard’s playbook and he will need to come up with alternative strategies at a drop of a hat.

In addition, I’d like to see Leonard continue to develop his physicality in both the neutral zone and the defensive zone. He does like to target vulnerable attackers with the puck, but doesn’t always implement the pressure to truly make the attacker feel vulnerable. If he can work on taking away space with more assertion, he will create more and more vulnerability.","A rugged two-way player with scoring touch, Leonard has taken a big step in his offensive game this season. He managed to make the U.S. U18 Team for last year’s World U18 Championship as an underager because he could play down their lineup and provide scoring depth. 

Now, he’s a top-line player scoring goals almost at will this season. Despite coming in at 5-11, 181, he plays so much bigger, engages physically and has the strength to be difficult to move off the puck. He’s very tough to beat in battles, too. What now puts him in the discussion for the Top 15, is that he’s added some increased scoring touch this season.",,"A drive-and-pop shooter, Ryan Leonard plays the game in the trenches. He’s not the biggest player, but he plays large and in charge. We’re expecting his new team to try him back in the middle of the ice - a position he’s familiar with from previous years. There’s speed, skill, and snarl all baked in here. A future fan favourite.",,
2023,D,71,180,,,9,Axel Sandin Pellikka,"Sandin Pellikka is a highly creative and intelligent puck-mover. He has excellent puck skills, showing the ability to beat opponents often with skill. He can improvise well with the puck, while also showing strong playmaking ability with the poise to make plays from the blue line at the highest levels. He is a goal-scoring threat who can score from range but also pinches well to get scoring opportunities. He skates well enough, and can make plays on the move creating offense off the rush and from blue-line activations. Sandin Pellikka lacks ideal NHL size for a defenseman but he competes well and doesn't shy from using his body to lay into opposing forwards. His defense will be his main question at the NHL level, but I think he plays hard enough to be a top-four defenseman.","There aren’t many players in this draft class who’ve come along quite like Sandin Pellikka has in the last year or so. He has been utterly dominant at the J20 level, played big minutes when things mattered most as an underager at the world juniors (including in three overtimes), looked himself in the SHL, and was the best defenceman in the tournament at U18 worlds in Switzerland for my money. He’s got really good edges and mobility and has shown improved speed in straight lines to pull away from chasers (with more room for growth there still). He walks the line to get shots through at a high level, wants the puck in the offensive zone and has the skill and shot to make things happen when teammates find him off the point or as the trailer off the rush (which he often activates into). He keeps his head up in the neutral and defensive zones and is a confident puck carrier on exits and entries. Though he’s not big, he’s athletic and he plays hard and engages in battles in the defensive zone with some sneaky strength. He’s got a good stick. He does a good job maintaining gaps and matching opposing forwards step-for-step skating backward, and times his close-outs and pinches effectively. He’s competitive and can really shoot it with a pinpoint accurate shot, a wrister that comes off hard.

There are times when he can wait too long to make his decisions and I wouldn’t call him super creative, but he makes good choices more often than he’s careless and he has progressed really rapidly. When he’s on, he can control the game in all three zones.","Axel Sandin Pellikka has consistently been one of the most fun players to watch this season. He’s an elite skater with quick hands that, combined with a hard shot and fantastic passing ability, make him a nightmare for the opposition. His lateral agility enables him to move freely along the offensive blue line with the puck on his stick, creating passing or shooting lanes with flashes of deception in the form of head or shoulder fakes. He remains patient with the puck and is able to create scoring chances from the back end all on his own. He also already has many professional defensive habits that should enable him to be an effective two-way defenseman in the NHL. He is always scanning the ice and anticipating, which allows him to close on players quickly in the neutral zone and kill transitions. He’s able to eliminate scoring threats before they even begin. His ability to avoid the opposition’s forecheck and start breakouts also improved significantly throughout the year, which earned him more responsibility and ice time in the SHL with Skelleftea AIK. These foundational tools and playmaking ability make him one of the highest ceiling players in this draft class. ","An average-sized defenseman who can really move, Sandin-Pellikka has bounced between the U20 and SHL ranks throughout this season. He has one goal with Skelleftea’s pro side and is averaging just under a point per game with the U20 team. Sandin-Pellikka is a player I seem to notice every time I watch him. He makes positive plays, engages physically and makes solid offensive reads. His ability to get pucks through and jump into plays makes him the kind of blueliner you need to be aware of at all times if you’re on the opposing team.",,"A mobile, creative, offensive, Swedish, right-shot defender. Phew, that’s a mouthful. Axel Sandin Pellikka enhanced his draft stock considerably with a strong U18 Worlds showing that despite not being very big and lacking truly elite feet, he can hang on both ends of the ice. There’s risk here, but the upside is that of a contributing second-pair defender on the premium side.",,
2023,LW,73.75,175,,,10,Eduard Sale,"Sale's toolkit is exciting. He's a good-sized winger who skates quite well and has a ton of natural offensive abilities. He has the hands to beat NHL defensemen regularly and with his length and speed he'll be able to drive play at even strength. Sale is a great passer who can run a power play well and hit seams at a strong clip. He can shoot the puck well enough but is better as a passer for me. His compete is OK. I wouldn't call him a physical or high-energy type of player, but he shows enough courage to get to the net. I would like to see him be more consistent as there's too many nights I watch him have little impact, even if he can take over games other nights. I think he's a very good player, who can be a legit top six wing in the NHL, but I also see him in the process frustrate coaches and fans.","It was tricky evaluating and contextualizing Sale last season, when he was above two points per game (99 in 44) in Czechia’s top junior league, doing things that had never been done and smashing (and even doubling in some cases) the production of recent top Czech players at the same age (including first-rounders like Jakub Voracek and Tomas Hertl). But he has since looked like one of the most talented players at three international events (Germany for U18 worlds, Red Deer for the Hlinka Gretzky Cup, and Switzerland for a second U18 worlds), while coming and going to produce at a fourth (the world juniors in Halifax) and coming and going to produce in the Czech Extraliga.

He’s a smooth skater who is noticeable in transition for both his ability to weave up ice and facilitate and also his ability to create breakaways for himself and beat goalies one-on-one. He’s got superb vision and ranks among the best in the class at dissecting coverage as a passer. I love him on the half-wall/point on the PP with his ability to hit east-west seams (he just seems to see every lane and opening). He can slow it down and pick things apart or hurry up his passes through holes. He has shown a knack for making big plays at big moments and can really shoot it, whether with a quick-release wrister or his dangerous one-timer.

He’s also a dexterous player who has good size (which will fill out). He can beat you on the perimeter with his skill (highlighted by excellent one-on-one hands-on defenders).

He lacks competitiveness and everyone would like to see him play with a little more effort both on (going to the guts of the ice more) and off the puck (cutting down on his gliding and puck-watching/keeping his feet moving and involving himself). Because when he does go to the inside, I’ve seen him get sticks on tips and redirects. He can definitely drift a little at five-on-five but his eyes light up and his head swivels when the puck lands on his stick, and skill plays against the grain usually follow. He’s got poise and patience on the puck. He’s got a multi-dimension shot. And while he’ll fade in stretches, the talent level is clear. With a little more consistency and some maturity, there’s a top-six playmaking winger there. He might drive some coaches crazy, but you don’t need all 12 of your forwards to be worker types and I like him to become a talented playmaker who plays well off of drivers.","Sale is one of the most talented players in a stacked draft in terms of raw skill and physical tools. There is really nothing much on paper that he lacks in order to be a high-end NHLer in the future. His game is built around plus skating, great passing (he is amongst the best playmakers in the entire draft) and an extremely high hockey IQ, especially in the offensive zone. He also has a quick – if at times awkward – release, is dangerous on the cycle, and is solid defensively. So why is he not a nailed on top 10 pick in this draft? There are a few reasons. He was buried in a 4th line role most of the season in the Czech Extraliga, and he played better than the stats suggest. He also struggled both at the Pro and Youth International level with his consistency. Furthermore, he is physically immature despite being 6’1, and is a bit too aggressive when on the wrong side of the puck. But if he falls past 15th overall? With time, patience and maybe a bit of luck? He could well turn out to be one of the steals of the draft. ","A crafty playmaker with impressive vision and confident puck-handling ability, Sale is currently playing middle-six minutes in Czechia’s top pro league. It can be a tough place to produce, but he has managed to put up some points in the early goings of the season and is on pace for one of the most productive seasons by a U18 player in league history. Sale is a terrific distributor, with the ability to find the right options and put his teammates in good position to score. He’s going to need to get stronger, but his play along the walls and down low hasn’t been an issue to this point. On top of his playmaking ability, he can finish, too, with a quick release and an ability to make the most of his best looks.",,"There’s no denying the skill level that Eduard Sale possesses. He blends complex handles with shifty skating, quality vision, and a strong release. He knows how to make things happen. Away from the puck is another story. He needs to prove capable of providing a consistent and focused effort for long stretches before he can even dream of the NHL. But if he can, ooh boy, look out.",,
2023,LW,72.05,195,,,11,Colby Barlow,"Barlow is a well-rounded winger. He is a strong skater who can transport pucks through the neutral zone. He's a hard-working forward who has some physicality, can kill penalties, and is quite physically advanced for his age. Offensively he has excellent stick skills and a great shot. He's a threat to score off the rush and from a standstill with his one-timer. Barlow's playmaking isn't his selling point, but it's good enough, especially with how skilled he is at creating scoring opportunities for himself. He projects as a top six wing who can play on both special teams in the NHL.","One of the more impressive 2005s in the CHL in each of his two seasons, Barlow scored 35 goals in 66 combined regular-season and playoff games as a rookie in the OHL, was named captain of the Attack for his draft year, and scored 49 goals in 63 combined games this season (both rare goal scoring for a player his age, and a rare honour for a player his age).

Barlow plays a direct, intentional game built around great hands, a physically mature pro frame, and an NHL shot (he can cleanly beat goalies from midrange). He’s also an able penalty killer, which should give him all-situations upside at the next level. He has a high floor and should safely become a strong third-line player but also has the upside to become more if things really click in his north-south game at the next level. Still, though he is a dominant junior player, it’s also fair to ask if his advanced growth gives him less runway for improvement (he really does look like a man already). He’s also not fast despite his strength, although he has made progress in his skating and does at times look powerful in straight lines once he builds speed (he moves just fine through his crossovers and can build speed and momentum that way, but he is sluggish from a standstill). I would like to see him tunnel-vision a little less and open up his plane of sight a little more. Even though he can score on them, he takes low-percentage shots a little too much for my liking off the rush (maybe because he feels he can’t take the D one-on-one so he shoots through them instead?).

The pro build, mentality and scoring tools are very appealing though and there are teams that have fallen in love with his game/makeup.","Barlow, often referred to as the “Man Child”, has been a man amongst the children in the OHL this season. Barlow can get to inside ice with ease against smaller junior opponents, and once there, use his heavy shot to generate offense. Barlow is also effective off give and go’s where he can find soft pockets of space in and around the crease to free up his stick. Both are the main areas he saw success during his dominant draft year campaign with Owen Sound. He finished the season with 46 goals and 79 points across 59 games. ","After posting 30 goals as an OHL rookie in 2021-22, Barlow entered the season with high expectations and has largely lived up to them. He’s a slick offensive performer with above-average skill and a heavy shot. He can score from distance, but makes plays in tight to the net and wins his share of battles in the hard areas of the ice. 

He can have a bit of a heavier stride at times and lacks quickness, but I would not call him a poor skater as he can get himself moving well enough. It’s the short-distance quickness plays that I have some concern about. Beyond that, though, Barlow is a smart player who can make quick plays, which should alleviate some concerns. Captaining Owen Sound at 17 is no small thing either, as he leads by example with a good work ethic and an ability to finish plays consistently.",,"Coaches love Colby Barlow. The goal-scoring winger is a mature individual – both on and off the ice. The CHL Scholastic Player of the Year also potted 46 goals in 59 games – second behind Bedard among CHL draft eligibles. His 12 game-winners shared the CHL lead. Despite the hefty beard and power-forward style, it’s likely he adds 20-plus pounds onto his frame as a prime-aged contributor. The skating is average, but there remains a lot to like here.",,
2023,C,71,170,,,12,Brayden Yager,"Yager is a player with a pro-style game. He plays with a lot of speed and energy, showing the ability to carry pucks up the ice and make skilled plays with pace. He’s not the biggest center, but Yager plays hard, showing a commitment to making plays without the puck and winning a lot of battles even though he's not overly physical. His main offensive weapon is his shot, which is high end due to his great technique and accuracy, but he does have the slick hands and vision to beat defenses in other ways. He didn't score goals this season like I thought he would with his shot, but I believe he will in future seasons. At his size there will be questions about whether he’s an actual NHL center despite his skating and effort. My comparable for him is an NHL wing, reflecting the risk in his projection at that position, but I see a reality where he turns into a Vincent Trocheck type.","Yager has been on the radar in western Canada for some time now, and he’s got some real pedigree to his profile and cachet to his game to support it. He was the No. 3 pick in the 2020 WHL Bantam Draft. He was the CHL Rookie of the Year (on 34 goals). He was an alternate captain and second-leading scorer at the Hlinka Gretzky Cup, and was an alternate captain and second-leading scorer with Moose Jaw.

His actual statistical profile is good without being great, though (it was helped by a strong 16-in-10 playoffs with the Warriors this spring). Still, he has been a consistent offensive player for Moose Jaw while playing a detail-oriented off-puck game (he was also a dangerous penalty killer and is decently strong in the faceoff circle).

Yager plays a threatening, attacking, puck-dominant game with skill in straight lines and in cutting sequences in transition. He’s got smooth skating mechanics. He’s also dangerous inside the offensive zone from the top of the circles in with a quick-release wrister (one of the faster releases in the draft) that comes off of his blade hard and with a slight, goalie-fooling adjustment pre-shot; good puck skill in congested areas; an ability to attack in bursts and make something happen out of dead plays; and an equal ability to play off of coverage and make himself available for his linemates.

He’s a natural scorer and creator who plays a direct style, but he’s also got plus vision and deft touch (though I wouldn’t say his creativity is necessarily a strength). I like the way he supports the puck defensively as a centreman, too, though he’ll need to get stronger to be as reliable defensively at the NHL level as he is in junior. He is very intentional with his routes, offensively and defensively, which should help him stick at the centre position long term. I don’t think he’s going to become the kind of star you’re hoping to get out of a top-10 pick, but he’s got 2C, PP1 upside if he can fill out his frame and continue to add dimension.","NHL head coaches are likely to debate whether or not they would place Yager at center or wing at the next level. Yager’s ability to use his power strides to get into open space to key up back door passing lanes is something that you will see far less of if Yager would be deployed at center at the next level. Instead of looking for opportunistic passing lanes for his teammates to use to feed him the puck, he will have to be the main driver of play and the pressure is only intensifying faster at the next level which means that Yager’s stick-handling in tight spaces will have to improve. If he’s deployed as a winger, he is going to do what he does best and that’s leverage his speed off puck to get into open ice. But, if he is deployed as a center at the NHL level, he will likely have to play more of a conservative role at times and that will mean that he playing further back in the offensive zone. If I’m drafting Yager, I want to leverage his shot and I don’t want him stuck under pressure along the perimeter.

With all of that said, if you take Yager and move him to the wing, I see him being a top six winger at the NHL level. He’s going to create give and go opportunities. Yager is going to score one-timers and backdoor goals. But, I do think that playing center at the next level will hinder his offensive upside. ","Armed with a quick release and heavy shot, Yager is among the draft’s most offensively gifted players. He’s a shot-pass threat that keeps defenders guessing, and when he has an open look, he does not miss. He scored 34 goals as a 16-year-old rookie in the WHL last season and is off to a good start this year. Playing alongside some talented players in Moose Jaw, he has been able to be a driver who makes those around him better. Yager was one of the real breakout stars of the Hlinka-Gretzky Cup and has continued on that path throughout the start of this WHL season. His anticipation skills are high-end and his offensive sense appears elite, if not close to it. ",,"Expectations were sky-high for Brayden Yager this season. Coming off a 34-goal, 59-point showing that earned him the CHL Rookie of the Year award, the goal appeared to be a top-five selection in Nashville. Instead, the 18-year-old’s stock has dipped – at least in perception. The speed-driven forward’s goal total dropped but his overall production improved. He also moved to the middle of the ice full-time, focused on improving his distribution game, and took substantial steps defensively. There should be a team more than happy to take a potential No. 2 centre at this stage of the draft.",,
2023,D,74.25,194,,,13,David Reinbacher,"Reinbacher is an excellent all-around defenseman. His mobility stands out immediately, especially as a 6-foot-2 right-shot defender. Reinbacher's gap control is quite strong; he kills a lot of plays due to his feet. He can close on guys with his body too, and shows a high compete level to win back pucks. He's very polished defensively for such a young player, and projects to shut down good NHL forwards. He's able to both skate and pass pucks up ice. He's got good offensive touch, showing solid hands and better vision. He's not dynamic with the puck but showed this season at a young age he could make plays and move the puck like a pro. His sense is very good and he projects to be a power-play guy in the NHL. Reinbacher is a potential top-pair, all-situations NHL defenseman.","We sometimes see draft-eligible D play their full draft year in a professional league. We seldom see them play big minutes in a good league, though — even when they’re on the older side, like Reinbacher is with his October birthday. But that’s what the Austrian did in Switzerland’s top flight this season, where he played over 20 minutes more often than he played under it. He even drove results at both ends in those minutes, with a positive goal differential on an under-.500 team that was outscored pretty significantly.

Reinbacher’s got pro size, desired handedness, and a really strong foundation of tools that all but guarantee he’ll become an NHLer. I expect he’ll be the first defenceman picked when all is said and done, and it sounds like he’ll go as high as the top 10 (which I wouldn’t scoff at). Reinbacher’s a solid forward and backward skater (though he can look a little stilted at times) who gaps well and defends the rush effectively with a noticeably long stick.

He looks to take instead of give in the neutral zone, regularly stepping up to try to bump puck carriers off possession and force dumps (though there are times when that style can leave him chasing if his timing’s off or he’s flatfooted). He’s strong. His head is always up and on a swivel and he does a good job pre-surveying the ice when he’s going back to get pucks through frequent shoulder checks. He’s got some poise and processing under pressure, even if his play with the puck on his stick isn’t dynamic per se. He’s just a rock-solid, projectable two-way defenceman. I’m not sure he’s got the skill to become a true No. 1, but he’s got everything needed to become a good top-four guy and maybe more than that.","If 18 year olds were the finished product in hockey? Reinbacher would be a nailed on top five pick. He is already a very good player in the NLA, the Swiss top professional tier that is arguably around the level of the AHL. He is better than players like Roman Josi and Mark Streit were at the same age, and is already the best blue-liner on the Austrian national team, and maybe even the best defenseman the nation has ever produced if he never developed from here on out. In terms of safe picks? The rangy right-handed defenseman has an unbelievably high floor. If he does not become at least a good NHL #4 defenseman in the near future it would be a shock. He has virtually no holes in his game, with good skating, good IQ, good gap-control, a great transition game, solid hands, a nice shot. So why is he not higher in our list? The easy answer? He does not have too many stand-out tools, and that likely prevents him from ever being a legit NHL #1 Dman, even if he does have clear-cut #2 potential. ","The top defenseman in the draft has all the hallmark traits of a top-four blueliner. At 6-foot-2, 185, he has an easily projectable frame. The Austrian-born Reinbacher also spent all of this season in Switzerland’s top professional league, playing significant minutes and scoring at a rate that is surpassed only by Roman Josi at the same age. Reinbacher is a right-shot with high-end mobility and smart puck-moving skills. He doesn’t dazzle you with skill, but he makes effective plays and can defend at a reasonably high level. In a year that is short on defensemen at the top of this draft, Reinbacher appears to have the highest upside.",,"David Reinbacher is one of these prospects who you just know will be a quality NHLer. He skates well, he has size, and he hits and hits to hurt. There’s a burgeoning offensive element to his game, but if that doesn’t translate, there’s still a bright future as a stopper who can move the puck with his feet. Needs to clean up that first pass yet.",,
2023,LW,69.5,175,,,14,Andrew Cristall,"Cristall is very talented offensively. He has puck-on-a-string type of hands and routinely beats defenders with his stickhandling. He has a highly-imaginative offensive mind and very good vision with the puck. Cristall is so dangerous on the power play because of his skill but also his great shot, as he's scored a ton of goals from range this season. The concerns come down to his frame and especially his skating. He lacks footspeed for the higher levels and has awkward skating mechanics that are concerning for his NHL projection where he too often defaults into the 10-2 skating style, overly relying on his edgework. He doesn't shy from going to the net, but I wouldn't call him a high-compete type. He will need to score a lot in the NHL to justify his various risk factors, and while I think he can get games due to his immense offensive talent, I have a hard time seeing him as a long NHL career type given his various risk factors.","Still one of my favourites in this class even after a first-round WHL playoff series and U18 worlds that underwhelmed many, Cristall is a creative, crafty playmaker who isn’t afraid to try things and possesses a rare ability to play in small areas, pull eyes and bodies toward him, and then expose opposing structures to the weak side of coverage.

A quad contusion cost him five weeks as his stock was on the rise, but it shouldn’t have taken any long watching this year’s Kelowna Rockets to realize just how much offence he creates for himself and his teammates while being a marked man every night. If this weren’t a draft that also featured Bedard, he was in the midst of one of the most productive draft-eligible seasons in recent WHL history (pacing to outproduce, for example, the 106 in 69 that 2011 No. 1 pick Ryan Nugent-Hopkins posted by 15 points).

Despite his diminutive size, he’s also a smarter player off of the puck than he gets credit for and I’ve been struck by how often he’s in the right position above the puck to hold play inside the offensive zone. He’s as fun to watch with the puck on his stick as almost anyone in this draft. When you think you’ve got him trapped, you usually don’t. He’s just a natural creator for himself and others who manufactures offence in a variety of ways. And while his speed in straight lines is a definite barrier, his skating is adjustable in tight spaces. He can also stickhandle himself into trouble at times, but he does such a good job holding onto pucks until his options open up that you’re OK with the odd offensive zone turnover. Despite his size, he also does a good job tracking pucks to the net so that he can be opportunistic.

He’s going to be picked lower than this on the basis of his size, position and skating, but I won’t be surprised if he becomes one of the more productive players to emerge from this draft class. His skill, touch, problem-solving and spatial awareness are legitimately high end. I expect that teams will place too much emphasis on his four games against Seattle in the first round plus his slow start at U18 worlds, and the team that strikes in the late first may well benefit.","Andrew Cristall was the premier playmaker in North America this past year while playing in the WHL. With the puck on his stick he facilitated the entire offense for Kelowna as he used great deceptive skating and puck skill to create passing lanes for himself to create scoring chances. He was no slouch in getting his own shot off either, as he was able to work into the interior to score as well as use his skill to create a rather impressive highlight reel of making defenders look silly. Cristall rarely engaged in the defensive zone in the WHL and struggled to find a consistent role in the u18s. As a smaller player he lacked explosive north-south speed to create separation from defenders. I’d bet on the offensive talent and that I attribute his skating to lack of strength and not skating mechanics in my viewings. ","Cristall is on an absolute tear right now in the WHL, looking like his impressive rookie season will be blown out of the water. Cristall had 69 points in 61 games as a 16-year-old last season. 

While he doesn’t have the size factor on his side, he does have the skill factor. Cristall is filling his highlight reel this season, slicing through defenses and beating goalies with creativity. His skating has to improve for him to be more effective at his size, though. His hands and ability to execute offensively give him a great chance to be an impact player down the road, so long as the feet start to come with it.",,"One of the most gifted play creators and handlers in the class has watched his stock fall precipitously over the back half of the season. But outside of a less-than-stellar U18 Worlds, Andrew Cristall is pretty well the same player he was early in the year when the hype was high. He can maneuver with possession extremely well. He’s able to hit on complex passing routes. He has a good shot. However, he’s undersized, under-equipped with his skating, and can be easily kept to the outside too often. There’s a path to an NHL top-six here, but it's a difficult one and entails a lot of growth in his overall game.",,
2023,C,73.5,186,,,15,Nate Danielson,"Danielson is a well-rounded center who has a lot of NHL traits. He's a big body who skates and competes well, which when combined with his offensive touch, allows him to be effective in a lot of situations. He has an excellent stick, and is able to beat defenders with skill at NHL speeds often. He makes a lot of plays with pace but also shows the vision and shot threat to run a power play off the edge. Danielson is a competitive two-way center who wins a good share of puck battles and can kill penalties. He looks like a potential high-in-the-lineup all-situations center in the NHL.","Just a couple of weeks away from having been eligible for the 2022 draft, Danielson, who was an MVP of Alberta’s U15 AAA circuit and the No. 5 pick into the WHL, was a point-per-game player and one of Brandon’s top producers last season before being named captain for his draft year. This year, after getting off to a bit of a slow start (one goal and five points in his first eight games), he really came back into his own as the best player on a bad team as the season progressed.

He’s well-liked by scouts and will go higher than this, but I think there’s a real chance he tops out as a third-line centre with room to become a second-line one, and if the former is the outcome, even if he’s very good in that role, that’s just not the kind of player I could justify ranking closer to the top 10 (though I did think about ranking him as high as 18th here).

Danielson’s a pro-sized, hardworking pivot who can skate and excels in driving through the middle of the ice, pushing tempo and playing with energy. He plays a well-rounded two-way game, is a proficient penalty killer, wants to make a difference in all areas when he’s on the ice and blends good overall skill with his effort. While his game doesn’t have the dynamism of the other kids in this loaded WHL class, most scouts like the projectability of Danielson to the pro game. I’d like to see him go past effective and really take over more, especially considering his age, but he makes his fair share of plays and it does feel like he has NHLer written all over him.","While Danielson’s development is still in progress, he brings quite a bit of quality tools to the table like his ability to generate quality speed in transition, his manipulation tactics to open up space for himself and quick decision making under pressure. Those tools allow him extremely effective at the WHL level and are going to come in handy once again at the NHL level. I have no doubt that Danielson is going to be an effective NHLer in a middle six role. The vision that Danielson has is going to lead to a lot of quality scoring chances in NHL play. He is going to be able to put pucks into high danger areas consistently because of how quick he is to identify space to use when traffic becomes daunting. Should he run out of options, he has a lethal shot that he can use from range. 

At the end of the day, whoever takes Danielson is getting a player with an extremely safe floor and a second line ceiling. ","Danielson is a 6-foot-1 player who plays like he’s a lot bigger as he has showcased plenty of power elements in his game. His ability to get to the interior with defenders hanging all over him is a special quality in a player his age. Born less than two weeks after the draft cutoff for last year, Danielson will be one of the older players in this draft, but that also gives him a longer track record to examine. 

Though his production is slightly below average this year, I don’t anticipate it staying that way. His ability to play a strong game, but maintain soft touch on the puck should allow him to produce at all levels. He thinks the game at a high level, anticipates well and he competes. Danielson does a lot of little things well.",,"One of the oldest players in the class, Nate Danielson also poses one of the safer floors. He has projectable size, is a right-handed centre, possesses pro-level tools across the board, displays leadership qualities, and produced well for a middling Brandon Wheatkings club. The 18-year-old is most threatening coming off of the rush on an arc and generates a lot of his chances through that mould. Likely suited for the middle-six in the NHL, the security in his base is soothing.",,
2023,RW,76,197,,,16,Matthew Wood,"Wood is a very gifted offensive player. He has excellent one-on-one skills and offensive IQ. He has the ability to hold onto pucks for an extra second and knows how to beat defenders with skill. He also has an excellent wrist shot and one-timer, making him a major asset on the power play. Wood is a big winger as well, so the size/skill combo has a lot of upside. However, his skating is an issue as he lacks the ability to separate and the pace of the NHL will challenge him. I wouldn't call him an overly physical or high compete type, and I've seen him take nights off, but Wood is a big body who can use his frame to win battles and gets to the inside parts of the offensive zone well enough. I think he'll be a quality top six winger who will be a big part of an NHL power play, but he may frustrate his coaches at times.","One of my favourites in the 2005 age group these last two years, Wood was the youngest player in college hockey this season (he was, for a moment, its only 17-year-old) and stepped right in to become an impactful player and eventually the leading scorer on a good UConn team (albeit as a winger after playing mostly centre at the Jr. A level, though he’s comfortable at all three forward positions). His point-per-game production as a freshman comes a year after he led the BCHL in goals (45 in 46 games) and points (85) for a 1.85 points-per-game clip that stands as the most productive 16-year-old season in the league in decades. Wood is a rangy, goal-scoring forward who has silky hands for his size (considering the long stick he uses, he’s got superb control on the toe of his blade out wide and the heel in tight to his feet), a marksman’s shot inside the offensive zone (both through a natural shooting motion and his one-timer), and a sixth sense for arriving around the net/slot at the right time. He protects the puck so, so well and does a good job holding onto pucks for that extra second required to walk into his spots.

He’s got quick hands one-on-one, he drops pucks back into his shooting stance effortlessly, and he’s got a beautiful curl-and-drag motion. He has also quite noticeably gotten quicker from a standstill and worked to up his work rate. Though he still needs to get a little quicker from a standstill, his skating isn’t an issue for me on the whole and when he keeps his feet moving in puck protection he draws a ton of penalties. He’s better suited as a playmaker and finisher than a power-forward type, but he has become sneaky competitive. I love the way he slows down the game, adjusts and maneuvers his frame and shades pucks. Mix in a multi-dimensional shooting arsenal and I see top-six upside.","Matthew Wood is a power forward prospect who just finished his freshman campaign at the University of Connecticut. Wood is particularly good at mopping up loose pucks behind the red line and then making a quick pass to a teammate in the slot. He’s got an excellent shot and is quite good with puck manipulation prior to shooting. Wood will delay, force the goaltender to completely shift over and then strike at the gap that the goaltender provided him. At this point in his development, I really want to see his speed improve. He doesn’t have great pace and he’ll need it for the next level. ","Currently the youngest player in the NCAA, Wood has made an instant impact for a UConn team that got off to the best start it's had as an NCAA Division-I program. Wood has been a top-six stalwart for the Huskies and made an immediate impact, scoring in his first NCAA game and not looking back. 

Wood has shown a higher-end scoring ability, can drive play and has the physical presence not to be pushed around. Last season, Wood put together the second-most productive season in the BCHL by a draft-minus-1 player over the last 20-plus years. He was able to accelerate his education to enter college a year early and has made a seamless transition. Wood’s skating could use some work, but he has a tremendous sense of where he needs to be and how to get there to maximize his offense. His sense of time and space in the offensive zone is what makes him most dangerous.",,"Matthew Wood has almost everything you want in a top prospect. Size, skill, pedigree, and production. The only issue is his feet. The skating is sluggish – lacking sustained depth and explosiveness. It’s improved over the last 18 months but needs to continue that path in order for him to reach his upside as a true top-six contributor. Whoever selects him will surely attempt to make him a centre long term.",,
2023,D,76,201,,,17,Dimitri Simashev,"Simashev is a toolsy defenseman as a 6-foot-4 blueliner who skates quite well for his size. He’s not dynamic offensively, but he has good puck skills, can beat checkers one-on-one with his hands, makes a solid outlet pass and makes some plays from the offensive blue line. He’s smooth and solid defensively, being good on his gaps and retrievals. Simashev competes hard, has some physicality in his game, and showed in the first half he could play against men at a young age. There is some debate on how much offense he has, but I think he has offense, and on a lesser junior team he would have scored more. You saw in the MHL playoffs when they leaned on him the offense came out more consistently. I see a lot of indicators of a two-way top-pair defenseman in the NHL even if I don't think he'll put up big point totals.","Every team wants long defencemen who can really skate and Simashev checks both of those boxes. He’s a rangy, smooth-skating defenceman who played 18 KHL games this year, was great in the MHL playoffs, will likely be picked higher than this, and may even be taken considerably higher than this. It’s hard not to like the way he way he can play in transition, whether defending the rush with his feet and reach or skating through neutral ice or out of the defensive zone in possession. But I don’t see a ton of skill/smarts in control, where his game can simplify. Add in a just-OK statistical and the talent in this draft and I couldn’t quite get to where some others did. I think he’s got a good chance to become a two-way No. 3-5 defenceman and look like a first-rounder when it’s all said and done, and I wouldn’t balk at a team taking him in the 20s, but the front half of the first round would come with some risk for me.","In my opinion, Simashev is quite possibly the best defenceman in this draft, and by far the best defensive player. He’s fluid on his skates, and very mobile, especially for a guy his size. He shuts down plays before they start; he reads and anticipates play very well, stepping up in the neutral zone with perfect timing to prevent entries without taking himself out of the play. He uses his size effectively and protects the puck really well, extending his long reach and using his free arm to shield off pressure. He’s not the most physical yet, but I think that’ll come when it’s necessary, he doesn’t really need to be right now, and he won’t take himself out of the play to throw a pointless hit. But don’t underestimate his offence either, there’s a lot more potential there than he gets credit for. If he has the puck, good luck getting it away from him; he controls the puck exceptionally well and adapts to pressure instantly, weaving through defences in transition and making it look easy. He’s a breakout wizard, great at escaping pressure with the puck, recovering it along the boards and combining his skating and puck protection to evade incoming pressure; he sniffs out contested pucks and turns them into offensive rushes in an instant. The stats still don’t suggest a very offensively skilled defenceman, but then you’ll watch him pull off like five insane plays in one shift that no other defenceman in this draft does, and you start to really see the potential that he has. To me, his upside is some of the highest in this draft, and I really believe that he can be a good #1 defenceman in the NHL some day. ","Size, skating, maturity and confident puck-moving capabilities, it's all there for Simashev. His offensive numbers were somewhat troubling this year, but they improved as the season wore on and he showed a more aggressive offensive skillset when playing among his age peers as opposed to playing with pros. His mobility as a 6-foot-4, left-shot defenseman gives teams a lot to work with. Under contract until 2024-25, the team that selects Simashev will have to wait a little while, but he's only going to get more pro reps in these next few years and potentially arrive NHL ready when that contract concludes in Yaroslavl.",,"There aren’t too many 6-foot-4 defenders who move as well as Dmitri Simashev does. The 18-year-old Russian played a considerable chunk of his season in the KHL and handled the pace and structure well. He’s not one for generating a lot of points, but you can see the skill and smarts - they just need to be unlocked. There’s a very high, minute-munching ceiling here.",,
2023,RW,70.75,163,,,18,Gabriel Perreault,"Perreault is an extremely skilled and intelligent winger who can make a ton of positive things happen inside the offensive zone. Perreault makes highly-creative and unique dekes and passes with the puck at a high rate, both off the perimeter and in small areas. His puck game is clear NHL power-play quality, and he will score as a pro. The issues on Perreault's game is his 5-foot-11 frame and his lack of footspeed. He shows good second effort and can win puck battles at the junior level, although whether he can do that versus men is a concern. His hockey sense is so elite though that I think he can overcome those issues and become a very good top six winger.","I’ve stuck my neck out on Perreault since the start of this season and I’m prepared to hold firm with my evaluation through to the end of this draft year, too. Eventually, when the points pile up like they did, and they happen making the kinds of plays that he did, you can’t ignore them. Say what you will, he’s now the NTDP’s single-season points record holder. He didn’t even pass Auston Matthews and Jack Hughes by a narrow margin when it was all said and done, either. There are many who’ve settled on Perreault as more of a mid-to-late first-rounder because of the combination of his skinny frame (though he has looked stronger all three times I bumped into him over the course of this season at the rink), the linemates he plays with, and perceived questions about his skating. He’s likely going to be the fourth player from the national program picked because his game is believed to be less projectable.

I’m less and less convinced of that. He’s a clever-beyond-belief, maneuverable facilitator and playmaker who plays the game with a light touch and a heady spatial awareness of not only where his teammates are, but where he is in the flow of play (and relative to defenders). The son of longtime NHLer Yanic Perreault and brother of Ducks prospect Jacob, Gabe doesn’t have his dad’s defensive acumen or his brother’s build (he’s listed at 165 pounds now), but he’s an intuitive, highly intelligent player who sees the play develop offensively at a more advanced level than his two family members did/do — and than almost anybody in the draft does. He’s got some of the quickest hands in the draft. He problem-solves his way out of trouble as well as anyone in this age group. He’s got dexterous tools catching, tipping and redirecting pucks. He arrives into space at exactly the right times to make himself available and finish plays. His ability to bait defenders and open them up so that he can slide passes through their feet is so impressive. He gets shots off extremely fast and without bobbles in catch-and-release sequences. He plans things out on the ice at speed and then finds ways to make his desired play. He’s a slick one-on-one player but will also wait that extra split second and then just sling a pass tape-to-tape across the grain. He became a real puck thief by year’s end, consistently tracking back hard to empty the tank and make effort plays on lifts.

And he’s a better skater than he gets credit for, with above-average speed for my money and room to add power and pick up another step as he gets stronger. Because of his genetics, he should add the necessary weight and strength eventually. I’d eagerly bet on him and with the proper patience I expect the right team will reap the rewards of a top-six playmaking winger. There might not be a player in this draft class who thinks the game offensively at his level.","Going into the preliminary ranking I was conflicted on what to do with Perreault. There were times he flashed an amazing ability to one-touch pass and spring his linemates open, as well as he possesses a high level of skill to create passing lanes through sudden puck manipulation moves that darted by the defenders stick. However, when the pace of play picked up I found Perreault’s impact on the game began to diminish. When space was not given to him I found that he struggled to slide off defenders to create optimal plays, which often lead to turnovers. However, he was the most involved player in transition on the best line in junior hockey, sported great dangerous passing metrics, and his off-puck ability in the offensive zone found him the recipient of a lot of high danger scoring chances. If Perreault can learn to operate in a faster paced game and create the space and time to do what he does best he’s going to outperform this ranking, however the concerns remain even if he did break Auston Matthews NTDP single season scoring record. ","The son of former NHLer Yanic Perreault and brother of former Ducks first-rounder Jacob, Gabe has a natural offensive ability. He always puts himself in positions to have success and manages to think the game at a high enough level that it overcomes his lack of high-end skating ability. Perrault has sure hands, a good shot and distributes the puck efficiently. Even in games where he doesn’t look as sharp, you look up and he has a few points on the board.",,"One of the smartest players in the class, Gabe Perreault makes decisions steps ahead of his competitors. However, he’s not all that big, lacks that electric east-west skating we want to see from a smaller guy, and struggles to maintain his posture and effectiveness while moving straight ahead. But he has plus hands, vision, and a sneaky release. You put those together with his mind, and he’s a good bet to beat the odds.",,
2023,C,74,187,,,19,Calum Ritchie,"Ritchie is a player with all the aesthetic tools. When you see a 6-foot-2 center who can skate and handle the puck like him, he sticks out in a massive way and some of the plays he makes are distinct at the junior level. He's a strong puck carrier and playmaker, who can create for teammates off the perimeter and do so with pace. He looks like a top prospect, but he's quite inconsistent. Ritchie has long stretches where he doesn't make much of an impact, and plays too much on the perimeter. The toolkit screams ""good NHL player,"" and I think eventually he will be that, but he may frustrate you along the way.","Ritchie is the complete package. From my first live viewing of him two Octobers ago in St. Catharines when he looked like the Generals’ most talented forward in just the second game of his OHL career, to his four-goal, seven-point series in Oshawa’s six-game first-round defeat against the Frontenacs last year, to his Hlinka performance last summer, to my most recent live viewings of him in Oshawa, in Langley at the CHL Top Prospects Game, and in Switzerland for U18 worlds (though I’ve been surprised that Hockey Canada, given his two-way and faceoff track record, has played him on the wing), Ritchie has consistently impressed me. On the puck, he’s a multi-faceted playmaker who often looks like the player who was the No. 2 pick in the 2021 OHL Priority Selection and an OHL First All-Rookie Team member.

He’s got quick hands (he’s prolific on breakaways/in the shootout), a dangerous curl-and-drag wrister, decent cleverness to his game as a passer (whether through seams or often blind), slick skill in traffic and out wide sliding pucks under sticks and rotating through coverage or past checks for a player his size, and a knack for finessing pucks into spots for himself or his linemates to skate onto. He has also begun to fill out his frame, which has helped turn him into a diligent, relied-upon two-way player off the puck.

This year, wearing an “A” as a 17-year-old with the Generals, he was arguably their most consistent forward while playing a key role on the penalty kill and late in games in the faceoff circle (where he is really strong). I’d like to see him pick up a bit more of an acceleration gear from a standstill (his stride can look a little short/stunted/heavy and he needs to do a better job of keeping his feet moving when he has control instead of slowing to a glide to survey), and fill the scoresheet a little more (though the talent around him has something to do with that too), but there’s a lot to like.

He takes smart routes with and without the puck, he has become a reliable three-zone player, and the skill is there (he’s got superb puck control skill). He does a good job finding inside ice in possession (or off of it). He’s also a very selfless player for his age who is quick to change in the offensive zone and will sooner make the right play than try to overdo it. I’ve liked the progress I’ve seen in how strong he is over pucks and getting up and under sticks to take them back in pursuit, or go to the net for tips (which he’s actually quite dexterous on) instead of always trying to free himself for his shot. When he keeps his feet moving, he’s an impressive player. There has been souring on him as a top-10 candidate because of his production and, at times, lack of pace (though in saying that scouts still have a lot of respect for his game) but I expect his production to take a big leap next season. He also battled a shoulder injury during the final months of the season and played good hockey through it.","Ritchie is one of the smarter players in this class, and that’s what puts him into the first-round conversation for us. He is committed to the defensive side of the puck and uses his pro-sized frame to make plays under pressure to break out. When at his best offensively, Ritchie uses his stickhandling superbly to get past defenders and create space for himself. As his game evolves, we would like to see more moves to the inside, and movement from east to west. ","You’re going to see a bit of a theme for this year’s draft in that there are a lot of forwards around 6-foot-2 or taller with high-end offensive upside. Ritchie is certainly one of them, as he’s got the hands to slither through defenses and the release to beat goalies from distance. Then he’s got the size to establish himself between the faceoff dots and make plays at the net-front. Ritchie had a spectacular performance at the Hlinka-Gretzky Cup which increased his already high draft stock and he’s kept up the impressive performances with Oshawa as he’s averaging better than a point per game in the OHL. ",,"There are several reasons to believe in Calum Ritchie. The first, and most obvious, is his intelligence. This is a player who runs into those thousands of little decisions on the ice and often makes the correct choice. He has plus-rate hands and vision, owns some physicality in his approach, and knows how to finish off plays. The reason to question him is his below-average foot speed which limits his effectiveness at the junior level to some degree. It needs cleaning up before he can take the next step.",,
2023,D,70,170,,,20,Mikhail Gulyayev,"Gulyayev has obvious offensive talents as he has clear NHL skating, hands and vision. Gulyayev is a highly-intelligent and creative puck-mover and can make tough plays at a quick pace. He creates a lot of controlled exits and entries, he projects to run power plays at higher levels and be a point producer versus men. Due to his size, how well he’ll defend in the NHL will be a question. I've seen worse defenders, and with his great skating he should be able to hold up at higher levels even with his slight frame, but it will be a question he will have to answer repeatedly. I see a regular NHL defenseman who will put up points, but may need to be used in a specific manner by his coach.","Gulyayev put together the most productive 16-year-old season by a defenceman in the MHL’s modern history (13 seasons dating back to 2009) when he posted 35 points in 54 games last year, regularly playing 20 minutes per game in a league famous for typically relying on older players. He did that after notching five points in five games at the Hlinka Gretzky Cup two years ago as a young 16-year-old, too. This year, though he struggled defensively in his limited minutes in the KHL, he was absolutely dominant in the MHL and looked quite comfortable in the second-tier VHL.

It has been a few rough age groups for Russian defencemen but Gulyayev’s got a chance to flip the script. He’s a commanding offensive defenceman who is at his best when he’s looking to take charge with his feet. And while we don’t often see smaller defenceman taken as high as I have him ranked here, he doesn’t play small and I like his game at both ends of the ice because of his mobility and the confidence with which he reads the play.

You’ll commonly see him activate to lead plays into the offensive zone and create something. He walks the line and bends coverage as an impressive and tactical power-play quarterback. But you’ll also see him make the heady escape play out of his own zone under pressure at five-on-five, or slide into a passing line to intercept a pass, or disrupt an opposing carrier with a tight gap and active stick. If he can become a second-pairing offensively inclined defenceman at even strength and a PP1 QB, that has major value in the second half of the first round. I think there’s a small chance he becomes a star or close with the right development, too.","Gulyayev has the mobility and the speed to be productive off of the rush, but isn’t really using his mobility to generate open ice for himself. With that said, he really needs to get out of his comfort zone and stop settling for low danger shots. I do believe that the mobility is there and he just needs to deploy it. But, every other facet of his game is well-rounded.

Even if he doesn’t use his mobility more and plays more of a conservative game at the NHL level, he will still earn plenty of minutes because of his defensive pressure, but he won’t have as big of a role. I do see Gulyayev playing in a top four defensive role, but if he doesn’t end up using his mobility more and more, he will likely end moving up and down in the lineup. But, at the same point, Gulyayev has been trained to play more conservatively like quite a few Russian defensemen and there are NHL teams that are looking for more conservative defensemen. Some teams will want Gulyayev to use his mobility and some might ask him to stay put along the blue line in the offensive zone.

He can be an asset on the power play at the NHL level with how well he toes the line to open up space for himself when an attacker is present, but he still needs the mobility to pinch up and drive play into / towards the slot.  ","In a weaker draft class for defensemen, Gulyayev stands out significantly for his high-end skating ability and skill. Though offensive-minded and not terribly big for a defenseman, Gulyayev is aggressive on his own end, has a good defensive stick and is good at skating pucks out of trouble. 

He has soft-touch puck skills and a respectable shot from the blue line. He has been dominant at the U20 level this season, but has also seen time at the KHL level with Avangard Omsk, but playing time has been tougher to come by at that level. 

Though Gulyayev’s skill level and skating make him a good candidate for the first round, his KHL contract presents challenges. He is currently signed through the 2024-25 season and teams would need assurances he’s coming over after that contract expires. On skill alone, though, Gulyayev belongs in the top-20 discussion.",,"stands out nearly every time you watch him. He can’t help himself with the way he can maneuver on the ice. This is one of the best skaters in the class who boasts terrific four-way mobility. He can open up space and lanes. He can jumpstart the rush, support the rush, be the rush. He can frustrate by missing options and opportunities, however. Defensively, it’s still a work in progress in-zone, but off of the rush, he owns good habits. There’s a lot of boom here.",,
2023,C,70.5,180,,,21,Reiley Heidt,"Heidt’s a highly-skilled and intelligent playmaker who can run a power play like a pro and has the hands to break open a shift. He hits seams at a high rate and makes a lot of creative passes. The question on him will be whether a 5-foot-10 forward with mediocre speed and compete is going to make a dent in the NHL. He is elusive enough of a skater too, even though he lacks the footspeed. He kills penalties in the WHL but I wouldn't call him a high-energy type who wins a lot of battles. He has middle-six forward potential and someone who can run an NHL power play but will need to round out his game to become that. He's been a junior center, and could be that as a pro due to his great hockey sense. He may need to be pushed to the wing, but if he hits he could be a Morgan Frost type of center.","Heidt, taken No. 2 in the 2020 WHL Bantam Draft with the pick between Bedard and Yager (he and Yager were actually teammates in minor hockey), is a talented and hardworking playmaker who keeps himself involved in the play off the puck and then makes plays between battles in possession of the puck. He was the go-to center for the Cougars in the faceoff circle this year. He’s also a strong skater who is light on his edges, plays with jump, builds speed quickly into flight to put defenders on their heels and/or create separation, leads a lot of neutral-zone carries into entries, and makes plays into space for himself or his linemates at pace, though he can over-pass at times (to the point where he passes up good looks). He’ll make plays through seams. He’s eager physically and can play a scrappy pest game when the intensity ramps up (which has resulted in a couple of suspensions in his time in the WHL). He’s unafraid to try things and has the skill to execute difficult plays. And he always seems to be around it.

His ability to make plays offensively both off the rush and inside the zone (where he’s got slick skill in traffic, great instincts off of the puck, and a lunch-pale approach) also gives me a lot of confidence that he’ll continue to progress. He was more impressive than his already-impressive 61-points-in-68-games season last year (where he led the Cougars in scoring), and the same was true in his strong, near-100-point season on a middle-of-the-pack Cougars team this year.","I believe that Riley Heidt possesses the characteristics needed to be a high-end, middle six center. His attention to playing down low paired with his hockey sense, are the main attributes I think he can enhance and feed off that will allow him to play center at the next level. Offensively he has outstanding distribution skills that won’t be lost at the next level, and quite frankly probably take away from some of the chatter surrounding his shot and release. The puck is on and off his blade so quickly, and Heidt has an absolute cannon for a one timer. I have no questions as to whether Heidt can play on an NHL powerplay. He most definitely can, and will.

For Heidt, the next step is filling out his body. Adding some muscle will make him heavier on the puck and make it even harder for defenders to strip the puck off of him. This will lead to further grade-A scoring chances. Overall Heidt is a very strong two-way defender who will almost assuredly hear his name called on day 1 of the NHL Draft.","A solid forward with good offensive instincts and a high-end shot, Heidt has been especially productive in his second WHL season. He’s an average-sized forward with good strength on his feet and an ability to transition quickly. For as gifted as Heidt is offensively, he’s looked more like a finisher than a play driver this season, which leaves a few questions about where he’d fit at the next level. 

Additionally, his skating is good, but he could use some more burst in his first few steps to better win races and close on pucks better. The offensive tools he has are certainly worth exploring further as he’s shown a mature game on the attacking end of the ice and is the kind of player the opposition always has to be aware of. ",,"Riley Heidt is another player who has forced us to really explore the projection portion of this exercise. The 5-foot-11 winger is one of the most talented players coming out of a top-notch WHL class. He has electric hands, his shot is a weapon, and he’s dangerous with the pass. All of these tools have made him an assassin on the man advantage. However, his play away from the puck at even strength can be maddening. Consistency, focus, and further effort in that realm are very much needed.",,
2023,LW,73.5,200,,,22,Quentin Musty,"Musty is a player with a lot of offensive touch in his game. He's a highly-skilled puckhandler who can make difficult plays with the puck at a high rate. He tries to make things happen and shows a strong level of creativity. Musty is a good passer who can hit open lanes and has the patience to pull up and make plays. He can score goals and is a shot threat from range but is certainly a player with a pass-first mentality. His effort is fine, he can use his big body to win battles but his game-to-game consistency isn't the best. He's a one-way winger, which combined with his so-so skating ability, is a concern for higher levels. There may be times you want more from him, but I think he will score so much that he will be a top-six wing.","The top pick in the 2021 OHL Priority Selection, Musty was one of the focal points of the Wolves offence this season and would have been their leader in shots on goal, assists and points were it not for a few weeks lost in January to a hand injury (following up on a strong showing at the Hlinka Gretzky Cup this summer). He’s a big, strong, sturdy, athletic, net-driven winger with slick puckhandling skill one-on-one and a balanced skater’s stride. He can unload from his hip into a heavy snapshot (which he was probably owed a few more goals off of this year) or drop and drive the net into a tuck play in tight. He’s also really comfortable passing from the perimeter and hitting seams in coverage, which gives his game added dimension. He’s great along the wall on the cycle, but he can also occasionally make a play that pulls you out of your seat. The raw potential is there in spades and the production caught up to it as his season progressed.

He’s got time to put it all together given his summer birthday, too. There was a time when folks thought Musty was the best American-born 2005 prospect and while that’s no longer the case there’s still a lot to get excited about.","I believe that Musty is a top six winger at the next level.

Musty has an excellent shot from range, distributes quite well off of the rush and does a great job of creating space for himself. His ability to create consistently at 5v5 is a credit to how well he handles pressure. Musty will take advantage of tight lanes when looking to thread the needle and will look to complete drop passes when hitting a wall. He’s got so many tricks that he can rely on to open up space when he is right about to shoot. There are times where he struggles to navigate the puck around tight pressure, but it’s become far less frequent as the season has gone on. 

The next step in his development is to work on his physicality. He has the frame and the power stride to get himself into situations where he can shut down puck movement, but a lot of the time, he ends up following through on the check too late. At the NHL level, Musty will be called upon to provide more physicality and so he will need to do a bit more fine tuning next season. Plus, if he can work on building up momentum with his crossovers when changing directions, he will be a handful to deal with when he is bearing down on you. You won’t be able to pivot out because Musty will be able to keep pace and pivot when you pivot. ","A gifted goal scorer with a heavy, accurate shot, Musty had a sensational season in the OHL with 78 points in 53 games. There are legitimate concerns about his skating ability, but at nearly 6-2, 200 pounds, he’s hard to knock off the puck. Musty has good-enough puck skills to create for himself and can finish. Off the puck, he needs work as he doesn’t have the ability to close quickly and challenge opposing players frequently enough, but it's not for lack of effort. He definitely competes and having that scoring edge will carry him a long way.",,"Quentin Musty has all of the ingredients you look for in a future power forward. He has the frame and he has the willingness to create chaos on the forecheck and along the wall. There’s a bit of pest mixed in there as well. Right now, it’s his vision and playmaking that stand out offensively, but his hands and shot aren’t too far behind. We would like his to quicken up by a step or two yet though. He’s added a layer of defensive competitiveness this season that’s a great sign of his recognition of faults and willingness to improve.",,
2023,C,71,185,,,23,Otto Stenberg,"There is a lot to like about Stenberg's game. He is a strong skater with good hands who can be a threat in transition. His shot is excellent, and Stenberg is often a threat to score from the faceoff dots, although I don't know if that will be his role on an NHL power play. Stenberg isn’t the biggest forward, but he gives an honest effort every night and doesn’t shy from going into traffic. His hockey sense is good enough to score at higher levels, but he's certainly more of a shooter than a passer. He's listed as a center but is likely a pro winger. I could see him as a second- or third-line wing in the NHL.","Stenberg was, coming into this season, viewed by many as the second-best Swedish prospect in this class to Carlsson after he played to nearly a point per game at the J20 level last year, looked like he belonged as an underager on the national team at U18 worlds, and impressed as Sweden’s leading scorer captain at the Hlinka Gretzky Cup (he also scored two Michigan goals last season and has continued to wear the ‘C’ for Sweden this season at events like the Five Nations, the World Jr. A Challenge, and U18 worlds, the latter of which he was tremendous in). Scouts are having a tough time slotting him due primarily to his so-so production this season at the J20 level (though he was better than his numbers reflected and didn’t look out of place in several stints with the SHL club).

He’s a crafty handler who hangs onto pucks to spin away from pressure, attacks in and out of crowds, makes plays into space for himself, and can comfortably make plays through layers to others. He’s also got an accurate shot from midrange, and regularly picks corners. I love the way he attacks on angles to help prevent defenders from taking him one-on-one (and to take pucks from the perimeter to the interior and create chaos around the slot/net). When he plays with pace and intention, he seems to have the puck all the time and he’s both effective and flashes his skill in all three zones. There have been times where he looks like he’s trying a little too hard to impress and make things happen instead of allowing the game to come to him, but even when things aren’t going his way and the points aren’t falling, I’ve always liked his involvement level, so it’s hard to get too down on him. He’s a smooth skater. He’s got smooth hands. He’s patient under pressure and can find his way out of trouble weaving and swerving through holes or away from sticks. He’s quick side-to-side on little jumps and drags. And he likes to try to take D one-on-one, which can result in some high-end plays but also some turnovers.

He’s a first-round talent who passes the eye test, and I think it’s only a matter of time until he starts to produce more consistently. I don’t think anyone who is familiar with his game would be surprised if he became a contributing top-nine forward at the NHL level someday.","Otto Stenberg has a lot of excellent tools in his arsenal that make him a second line upside day 1 NHL Draft target. He’s shifty, mobile and has excellent stick-handling that he’ll use to get out of tight jams at centered ice. If he runs out of room and simply can’t navigate out with his footwork or handling, he makes use of whatever passing lane he has and more than often at the SHL level that meant passing underneath the stick of the attacker. When he has the puck on his stick, he’ll rely on his crossovers to create the separation to go one-on-one with the goaltender at net-front. If he simply can’t pull away from pressure, he’ll look to pepper the slot with passes. In transition, he won’t force the puck into dodgy situations and will button hook. Stenberg will then identify a secondary lane and take advantage. He’s got great problem solving skills. ","A star turn at the Hlinka-Gretzky Cup where he led Sweden with nine points over five games built Stenberg some capital this year. His season to date in Frolunda’s system has been a little more confounding, though. Production-wise, it’s been fine, but he hasn’t outright dominated at the U20 level. Stenberg has still gotten looks with the pro team, too, which is no small feat for a 17-year-old at that club.

The tools are there for Stenberg to be a quality prospect as he’s a good skater with some quickness to him. His hands are above average and there’s some good creativity to his game. Stenberg needs to get stronger to make a greater impact. I’m not totally sure he’ll be a center at the next level, but that is his natural position. 

As the season progresses, we’ll need to see more consistency out of him to be able to project him comfortably in this range, but Stenberg has often been a player who plays up a level and has a lot of success. We’ll see where his game goes from here, starting with the U18 Five Nations in November.",,"seemingly has two versions of himself. The club-level player who flashed brilliance at the junior level and was competent in bite-sized chunks among SHL competition. And then the Stenberg who wears the national team jersey. The latter version is a destroyer of worlds. His game elevates so exponentially that it's difficult to correlate which is the real Stenberg. Quality skating, high work rate, leadership qualities, and a likely future as a penalty-killing, middle sixer.",,
2023,C,68,168,,,24,Gavin Brindley,"With excellent skating and work ethic, Brindley buzzes around the ice, playing with a ton of pace and giving his best effort nightly. He's able to make skilled plays at full speed, and plays with courage, going to the net and engaging along the walls. Brindley's pure offensive touch won't dazzle, but he has good hands and hockey sense and can make plays at higher levels. There aren't a ton of two-way forwards in the NHL who barely touch 5-foot-9, but Brindley has the right mix of traits to be the next one even if there's risk on his projection. I see a middle-six forward whether at center or the wing, but likely the latter.","One of three players on this list playing college hockey this season, it felt like Brindley got better with every game at the University of Michigan, to the point where he went from comfortable to impactful every single night, including at centre and on the wing (I think he’ll be a winger at the next level though). Brindley’s a plus-level skater who gets through his extensions quickly (including from a standstill), excels on his edges, rounds corners sharply, and darts around the ice, hunting pucks and pushing through holes.

He’s also got some of the quicker hands and better touch on this list. He thrives in the small-area game, using light passes and rapid movements to play in and out of coverage. He has now impressed me wherever I’ve watched him (NCAA, USHL, Five Nations, U18 worlds, world juniors, etc.) as a small but highly involved forward who plays the game with energy and pace, making little skill plays between coverage. He buzzes around the ice and does such a good job releasing from one battle or chance to hunting or getting open for the next one. He’s always moving. He’ll make the soft play to the middle of the ice from the perimeter, or go there to get to rebounds or position himself on screens/tips. He’s excellent in puck protection twisting away from coverage to make things happen along the boards. And he just always seems to play well, no matter the role/usage/stage. And the beauty of Brindley’s game is that while he may prove talented enough to play in a skill role at the NHL level, he’s got the approach/tools to play an effective bottom-six game too (plus, he's built quite strongly for his height). That will limit concerns about his height (he has certainly never played small).","Gavin Brindley plays the game of hockey exactly how I’d want a player to play. He’s got great speed and very good edges. He was the primary transition player on a line that included Adam Fantilli and Rutger McGroarty for the second half of the year. His lack of point production to start the year was bad puck luck, as he was a great dangerous shot generator and facilitated play extremely well as he earned the second line starting center role on one of the best teams in college hockey. When Fantilli was brought on his line he was able to showcase being a facilitator to two great shooters, and he was rewarded with a positive regression in his point production. He has tremendous awareness on the ice and his ability to read plays and position himself offensively and defensively to continuously make an impact won over my adoration. The only real fault I have in his game is his lack of strength when going by players in the interior of the zone, but with a few years in college and his high-end motor, I don’t see this as a reason to drop him in the rankings but rather just an elongated timeline to get to the NHL compared to other players in the top 10. I wouldn’t be shocked to see Brindley as a Hobey finalist before his collegiate career is over.","An energetic spark-plug kind of player, Brindley is off to a good start at Michigan. He plays with good speed and has tenacity off the puck. He can be a bit of a pest in that way, but he’s also got the skill to produce. His size is going to make him a fringe first-rounder, but I am especially fond of his competitive drive and ability to make plays in transition. ",,"It’s easy to root for Gavin Brindley. He’s undersized but plays with tremendous heart. He’s elusive, versatile, and owns two-way nuance. He racked up points as a true freshman at Michigan this past season. If he was a few inches taller, we’d be discussing him much earlier on. We’d like to see more physical pushback and instigation.",,
2023,LW,75.25,195,,,25,Samuel Honzek,"Honzek's game is exciting from a pro-projection standpoint. He's a big forward who can skate well, which when combined with the offense he's showing makes for a well-rounded player. I don't think he's amazing with the puck, but he has good hands, can make tough plays with pace and can finish chances both from range and in tight. In the WHL he ran the power play from the flank but that likely won't be his role as a pro. Off the puck he shows good details and a strong work rate. He wins a lot of battles and can kill penalties. Honzek dabbled at center for a couple of WHL games but is likely a winger as a pro. Even as a wing he projects to be an important two-way player for an NHL team.","Honzek was on one of the steeper ascents in the draft this season when he suffered a leg injury in Slovakia’s second game of the world juniors which sidelined him until late February. He’s a big winger whose game really fit right from the get-go on North American ice, quickly establishing himself as a go-to player in all situations for the Giants (even though he was an underager, Slovakia was playing him a ton early on in the world juniors, too). He skates quite well for his size, he’s got good hands and dexterity, he’s got great feel and sense for the pressures that exist on the ice, and he’s by all accounts a great teammate and kid who is coachable and pays attention to the details of the game. There’s a lot of belief out there that he’s going to be a well-rounded middle-six NHLer and maybe more (though I’m not sold on him being more than that, he’s still a very good player and will be picked higher than this as a result). He’s still got room to get stronger, too, so it’s not as though he’s a finished product.","Honzek is a powerful centreman that uses his plus agility and edgework to get to dirty areas in front of the net. He is great a creating chances using little stick lifts and plays to free up lanes to his stick. With this being Honzek’s first year playing in North America, he has showed that his game is best suited for the smaller ice surface. He has shown a willingness to be dogged on pucks in the defensive zone, but filling out his frame is the next step on route to being a dominant modern day power forward. ","Briefly derailed by injury, Honzek’s season was one that saw him consistently rise. Earlier in the year, he was generating a lot of buzz with his play as a 6-foot-3.5 forward who can drive the net and make plays in the hard areas of the ice. He doesn’t necessarily have any one stand out trait, but he does everything pretty well. You don’t have to worry about his work ethic on the ice and he absolutely battles against opposing defenders, giving them all they can handle. I had wondered coming into the season if he'd be able to produce, but his skill shined through as he has a very good shot and is sure-handed with the puck.",,"Samuel Honzek is a 6-foot-4 power centre with across-the-board skills and a penchant for physicality. If it weren’t for an injury, he would have taken home WHL Rookie of the Year honours. His transition to North America was very impressive. It’s likely a team jumps on him early for his floor, but if he can start to calmly handle pressure more regularly, there’s a solid ceiling here too.",,
2023,RW,73,180,,,26,Tom Willander,"Willander's skating is his main asset for the NHL; he is one of the best skaters in the draft. He has a quick, powerful skating stride and can push the pace up ice with the puck. Willander's skating allows him to close on checks well and be a quality defender especially when combined with the fact he has some physicality in his game. I wasn't always sold on his offensive touch. I don't see a big-time playmaker as a pro, but Willander has good enough skill and vision to move pucks at higher levels well, especially given the space his feet can generate. He has the making of a good two-way top four defenseman.","One of the better-skating defencemen in the draft, Willander, who is committed to Boston University for the fall, was a horse for the Swedish national team and Rogle’s junior team this year. He’s a strong-in-all-three-zones two-way defenceman who plays a confident and decisive game that uses his beautiful, balanced skating to push forward or fall back onto his heels and outlet the puck. He pulls away or retreats from pressure with ease and excels on exits. His head is always up. He gets his shots through. And then on top of the pro frame, and the skating, and the general athleticism, he also just plays the game with an intentionality that is rare in players his age. He looks and operates like a pro out there, his passes are quick and firm, he’s aggressive on pinches and closing gaps, and rarely mistimes them, swallowing up play defensively. Willander doesn’t have dynamic skill or creativity on the puck, but he projects safely as an NHL defenceman and might be a two-way transition monster in a second-pairing role with the right development. I expect him to step right into the college game and be impactful.","Tom Willander is a big, mobile, right shot defenseman playing for Rögle BK. He’s a very intelligent defenseman who uses his high-end mobility to evade forechecking pressure and make life easy for teammates with a successful first pass. He’s solid defensively both in-zone and against the rush, and he plays a conservative style that enables him to play relatively mistake free hockey. That conservative style is effective in his own end, but it also limits his projection from an offensive standpoint. He oftentimes will rely on hopeful shots from the point instead of experimenting with the tools in his arsenal, ultimately hindering his ability to be an offensive threat on a consistent basis. I’d like to see Willander occasionally step outside of his comfort zone and add a layer of unpredictability in his offensive game. ","A rare European player that is bound for NCAA hockey, Willander played exclusively at the U20 level in Sweden this year. While he did not showcase a particularly high-end offensive toolkit, he is a tremendous skater and high-end defender. Willander can be physical and has a good defensive stick. Additionally, his footwork is such that he’s difficult to beat wide. He can close gaps quickly and also has good recovery speed. Meanwhile, he can get pucks up ice and makes good reads both offensively and defensively. Just don’t look for Willander to be a major point producer from the back end. He still does more than enough to garner a top-four slot down the line",,"Few players rose their stock as much as Tom Willander did throughout this season. His impact is driven primarily by a combination of elite skating and an unquenchable motor. He’s extremely competitive in pursuit of loose pucks and can match up against the rush very well. He loves to finish checks and finish them hard. The offensive upside may be a tad lesser than some other defenders behind him, but he’s going to chew up a ton of minutes.",,
2023,D,73,194,,,27,Lukas Dragicevic,"Dragicevic is very dangerous with the puck on his stick. He has good hands and better instincts and vision. He can run a power play like a pro. He shows the high-end IQ to let plays develop, hold pucks under pressure, and jump into attacks at the right time to go with a strong point shot. The question with Dragicevic will be without the puck. He's an OK skater and competitor. I think he defends well enough in junior, but there will be questions on how he defends size and speed in the NHL. He's not undersized and his offense is so good that I think he plays and scores in the NHL, but coaches may need to be careful in how they deploy him.","One of the more difficult evaluations in this draft, Dragicevic led a poor Ameircans team in scoring by 11 points this year, registering 15 goals and 75 points in 68 games. Typically, a player with that kind of statistical profile would rank in the first round. Especially when he’s a 6-foot-2 righty. But Dragicevic’s game has some real warts, highlighted most notably by, as one scout aptly describe to me, “clunky feet.” He gives too much in his gaps, likely to compensate for his footwork and also his processing speed (he’s just doesn’t pick up on when to close gaps in real time fast enough). He lacks foot speed going in straight lines forwards and backwards, where his stride can look rushed and heavy, and his pivots are a real issue. There are obviously some legitimate tools, though, too. He uses his shoulders as a tool across the blue line to make defenders go to one knee and shape shots through. He evades pressure well because of his hands and fakes. He has OK edges crossing over across the line or dropping back onto his heels in possession. He’s comfortable carrying the puck and eager to make plays, with the finer skills needed to execute through seams and stickhandle his way out of trouble. His skating and lackadaisical decision-making reminds me of a lesser version of Evan Bouchard at the same age, and Bouchard is a kid I was higher on than most and has turned into a legitimate NHLer. I’m fascinated to see where he goes and whether he’ll find his way.","Dragicevic is one of the more dynamic offensive threats from the backend in this draft class. His passing is superb, and he kickstarts many plays in transition using it. He is best hitting teammates on the move, and this creates many odd-man opportunities for his squad. Skating is another area where Dragicevic separates himself from his peers. He is confident carrying the puck, has great four-way mobility and can maintain these traits while under pressure. In the defensive zone, he will be a bit of a project. He lacks consistent scanning in the defensive zone, and this effects his positioning, and efficiency retrieving pucks in his own end. ","With good offensive skills highlighted by an accurate, quick shot, Dragicevic has a chance to go in the first round. He has the size and is a right-shot, which are attractive qualities, but so is the fact that he had 75 points in 68 games for Tri-City. The big concern is a valid one in that Dragicevic is below average defensively and lacks awareness at times in his own zone. The offensive toolkit is immense and alluring, but I don’t know if he’s well-rounded enough to warrant the inherent value afforded first round picks. That said, it's not so much of a concern that I'd drop him any further than here. Those offensive traits are pretty excellent.",,,,
2023,C,75,222,,,28,Charlie Stramel,"Stramel's pure athletic tools are highly intriguing. Stramel is a 6-foot-3 center who can skate well and plays a highly-physical brand of hockey. He can power his way through checks and to the net and never shies away from an engagement. The degree of offense is the major question on his game. I think he has good hands and can create a little, but he lacks vision and won't be a big-time scorer as a pro. If you go into picking Stramel understanding the offense may be limited, but you'll see get a guy who can help you at even strength a lot and potentially be a nice third-line center, you'll be happy. And I do think there's a chance he can be more than that, too. Due to the lack of sense there is a possibility he may need to be a wing, but his great faceoff skills could counteract that.","After conversations with scouts or folks at the national program about Stramel last year, I always felt I wasn’t quite where they were in terms of their belief in the player and his upside. That continued to start this year as he struggled to have a real impact with the Badgers early on as a freshman (albeit it a young one, and albeit on a bad/at-times lost team). He started to come on before the world juniors, though, and then he was good in a bottom-six role for Team USA and he played quite well in college down in the second half.

Nicknamed “Big Rig” when he was at the program, Stramel is a heavy kid whose athletic, muscular build jumps out at you right away. His strength complements a competitive, physical, forechecking, middle-lane style that makes good use of his length and hard wrister from mid-range. He can push into space. He’s got decent hands when he pushes through the middle.

Scouts are fascinated by his power forward package and size down the middle (following a move to centre from the wing as a 16-year-old). I have questions about his talent level, though. He too often looks like the third guy on his line. It’s not that he plays poorly (he rarely does) but I don’t see enough playmaking to warrant a top-20 slotting and he’s a little sluggish from a standstill through his first few strides (once he gets moving, his stride actually has good power and he’s a decent skater for his size on the whole). When he’s around it, he can be a handful. But getting around it consistently enough at higher paces has proven to be a bit of a challenge and his decision-making can look a little slow. He may become a darn good, hard and heavy bottom-six player at the next level in time, but he’ll have to show me more to warrant a projection higher than that (a projection some others do still believe in).","Charlie Stramel projects as a checking line forward at the next level. He uses his size well to trap attackers at both ends of the ice and will lay down checks along the boards to cause puck disruption. Stramel isn’t the fastest north-south skater, but he does like to be involved in transitional play. He will utilize his crossovers to get the speed that he needs to carry the puck up ice, but defenseman are able to trap him before he can get down low with the puck. So, he’ll look to re-distribute in low danger. ","Stramel has been off to a relatively slow start as Wisconsin has struggled. That said, his physical tools are such that you worry less about the numbers and more about his overall ceiling. Stramel checks in at 6-foot-3, 215 and has excellent mobility for a big man. 

Stramel is a physical presence in the games he plays, but I'd like to see him get even more aggressive in his physical game and play a little meaner. His skating allows him to separate, and he’s near impossible to knock off pucks. On top of that, Stramel has a quick release on his shot. 

He’s only scratching the surface of his potential, but I do have some concerns about his overall hockey sense and ability to create for himself and others. This season isn't alleviating that just yet. He has the skill and speed to make it happen—he just needs to execute better and more consistently. If he does, Stramel could shoot up this list in a hurry.",,"It’s not easy sliding into the NCAA as a true freshman. It’s even more difficult when you’re thrust into a marquee role without much surrounding talent to insulate you. That’s what Charlie Stramel had to deal with this past season. Overall, it was a difficult campaign. He was at his best at the World Juniors against his peer group, where his size and physicality were weaponized more. There’s a clear path to a bottom-six future here, but also a shot at a second-line type who can impact the game in a lot of ways.",,
2023,RW,75.25,215,,,29,Kasper Halttunen,"There’s no doubting the offensive ability Halttunen has. Halttunen is very skilled and his shot is a legit threat from range. His wrist shot and one-timer project to beat NHL goaltenders. Combined with the fact he has a large frame and there’s a lot to like. Halttunen has a heavy stride, though, and his compete can be in and out. Sometimes he leans too much on his shot as well as opposed to making a play or taking the puck to the net. When he’s on, he’s a physical presence with offense and doesn't shy from using his body. He has middle-six if not top-six NHL tools, but I wonder if the way he plays will result in a long NHL career.","It was an up-and-down season for Halttunen, the top prospect in a weaker age group than usual for the Finns. He impressed at the last two U18 Worlds in Germany and Switzerland (the latter of which he registered 10 points in five games in and scored some pretty goals with both his shot and off of drives to the crease), can look like a force against his peers at Finland’s top junior level, looked himself in a six-game stint in Mestis, but fought it at last summer’s Hlinka Gretzky Cup. He also struggled to make an impact in 28 games in Liiga after registering seven shots on goal in his pro debut.

Halttunen has promise as a driven, shot-first, power-forward style winger who can really impose himself against his peers with his ability to get to his spots, outmuscle opposing players, and play a menacing physical style off the puck.

He’s got a pro-built game and frame but he can also make plays for himself and his shot is extremely heavy. He plays to the inside and then he’s got the skill needed to make plays around the net, even at 6-foot-3. He can definitely be a lot to handle for opposing players when he builds a head of steam, drives into contact in possession, and they have to engage with him. He protects pucks really well and has sneaky-soft hands through his practiced patterns handling the puck (his hands can look a little sloppy when things get hectic though). His snapper is certainly NHL quality and has shown it can cleanly beat goalies from mid-range (the puck really rattles off his blade).

I do worry at times about his problem-solving, discipline, play selection and feel enough to rank him outside the first round, though. And his skating can look a little stilted from a standstill (he’s got decent power once he gets going).

He’s a legit prospect but I haven’t seen a star quality in him (at least not yet).","Two years ago the hulking Finnish winger was being talked about as a potential top 10 pick. It is easy to see why. At 16 years old he was 6’3 and over 190lbs, with a booming shot, good hands and who is not afraid to get physical as well as working hard up and down the ice. But over the last year his stock has fell significantly. However, since stepping up to the pro level and not being able to physically bully opponents, he has struggled, and while he has still been able to produce in junior international play there have also been concerns with “how” he has played. He often tries to force plays that are just not there, shoots when he should pass and passes when he should shoot. Versus men he also does not use his size well enough, despite being a modern “power-forward” and liking to get to the net and boards, and seems to get frustrated easily and let that take his mind off the end-game. However, he still has the potential to be a top-six goal-scorer if he develops well, matures and learns to read the game better. ","Halttunen is yet another one of them, bringing both size and skill to the table. He’s in an interesting position this year because he outright dominates the Finnish U20 leagues, but hasn’t quite established himself as a regular on the pro team where minutes are harder to come by. 

That’s not a huge concern, though, as he’s gotten a lot of good looks already this season. Halttunen could push up higher on the list if he gets more opportunities at the pro level. He’s got good hands, battles well and can provide an inside presence that teams need to create offense. Even if the points don’t come for him at the pro level this season, the potential he’s shown is such that he should still be a high pick.",,,,
2023,RW,69,166,,,30,Jayden Perron,"Perron has a lot of offensive talent. His game starts with his skating. He's got a quick, powerful skating stride that will create controlled entries and push the pace at higher levels. Perron can make skilled plays on the move through defenders and to teammates. He's a strong passer while also being able to finish chances with a shot that can pick corners from range. Perron has skill, but the question is as a 5-foot-9 forward, is it dynamic enough for the NHL? Also, while I don't think he lacks effort, as a smaller player he can be pushed off to the perimeter too easily. He has a good chance to play games but it's unclear if he will be a top-nine scorer in the NHL.","One of the USHL’s most talented and intelligent offensive players, Perron got off to a hot start, was briefly halted by an eight-game December stretch that saw him register just one assist, and then really turned it back on to play his best hockey down the stretch. He’s a player who has earned the respect of those around the USHL among both rival players and staff.

When you spend some time watching him and asking around about him, you quickly realize why. Perron, who didn’t go the popular prep-school route in western Canada, was a terror in Manitoba’s minor hockey ranks who stepped right into the titanic Steel last season and immediately flashed his skill with the puck, producing 48 points in 63 games to earn USHL All-Rookie Second Team honours. This year, he finished second among all under-18 USHL players in scoring to his teammate and projected 2024 top pick Macklin Celebrini. With the puck on his stick, he’s a treat to watch. Evasive. Slick. Problem-solving. Finesse. Manipulation. It’s all there. You want the play to run through his hands and brain.

He’s got some of the best soft skill in the draft. His size is obviously a talking point, and there’s a boom-or-bust element to his projection, but he’s a first-round talent and was a clear play-creator on a team with a few of them in Chicago this year. I expect him to become a top point producer in college at the University of North Dakota. Players with his on-ice smarts almost always make it these days and I expect him to be no different.","Jayden Perron is an undersized forward in the draft, but doesn’t let that get in the way as he shines offensively. He can serve as a duel-threat attack both as a playmaker and goal-scorer. With the puck on his stick, he is super evasive and fools the opposition with his slick hands and patience with the puck. When Perron uses his mobility and puck-handling skills to enter the offensive-zone, he becomes an immediate threat to the other team. He has good straight-line speed, but could work on developing a longer skating stride, which would make him even more dangerous of a player. His balance and edge work make him very dangerous when you combine that with his stick-handling ability. Perron can be a hard player to knock off the puck as he uses his lower-body and edges to block defenders. On the power play, he can play on the point as the quarterback as well as led the breakout of the defensive zone. The only thing Perron will have to work on in his offensive game is to not be overly flashy at times. ","After a slow start to his USHL season, Perron had a big second half and started showing some more dynamic elements to his game. He’ll have to contend with doubts about his size, but his game took off down the stretch. That improvement is encouraging. Perron has good vision, skates extremely well and has quick enough hands to challenge defenders and keep them guessing. His goal scoring also picked up this year thanks to a high-end shot and an ability to get it off in a lot of different ways. He will constantly have to prove himself because of the size, but he put himself in position to get picked reasonably early on Day 2. ",,,,
2023,LW,70.25,160,,,31,Bradly Nadeau,"Nadeau has very good individual skill to couple with excellent speed. He's quite dangerous in transition due to that combination. He can skate by and beat a lot defenders, but he's also excellent at creating with space. He sees the ice at a high level, making a lot of seam passes and making tough passes on the move. On the power play he can make a lot of plays, but it's his shot that's a real weapon. He has an excellent one-timer that projects to beat NHL goalies from distance. His shot is both very quick, and fast, as he rifles pucks into the corners like a legit NHL scorer. Nadeau isn't the biggest winger and he can play on the perimeter a tad too much, but his compete is good enough — especially with his skating and offense — that I think he plays and scores in the league as a middle-six winger.","The BCHL’s leading scorer while playing on a line with his older brother Josh (a player I vouched for as a worthy late-round flier ahead of last year’s draft), Nadeau is a multi-dimensional forward whose hands, skating and shooting all get very high grades. A Maine Black Bears commit, Nadeau creates offence in a variety of ways, bursting wide or pulling away from defenders in transition with his quick feet, taking the puck right at or through coverage with his maneuverability, or leaning into a pinpoint shot (whether off of catch-and-releases, standstill shooting mechanics off the flank on the power play or through his one-timer — which the Vees have tried to open by playing him, a right-handed shot, on his off wing this season). His 113 points in 54 games this year were the most by an under-18 skater in the BCHL since Kyle Turris in 2007, outproducing players like Kent Johnson, Alex Newhook and Tyson Jost at the same age.","Bradly Nadeau paired up with his older brother to dominate the BCHL with his speed, shot, and puck skill. He was one of the most involved offensive transition players in my data set, was in the top 10% in terms of passes sent to high/medium dangerous areas, and was a top shot generator. He could be a bit passive in the defensive zone, but his speed, skill, and shot were very notable to track. I question his NCAA choice (Maine with his brother) and the BCHL’s top scorers haven’t produced into top 6 scoring roles recently, but his skill-set is one I’d bet on. ","Nadeau was an unstoppable offensive force in the BCHL this season, scoring 113 points in 54 games. It was one of the 10 highest-scoring seasons in the league over the last 20 years. He followed that up with 35 points in 17 playoff games. Nadeau is headed to the University of Maine next year. He’s a crafty offensive player with excellent hands and a good shot. He might have one of the best one-timers in the draft as well.",,"Bradly Nadeau and his Penticton Vee teammates know a thing or two about winning. It was almost comical how much better they were than the rest of the BCHL competition. Nadeau was the best player on the best team. He owns a high-end release - a top five in the class release. He has plus hands and playmaking. His offensive IQ is impressive. The skating posture needs some work, but he’ll have time to do that at school. Real upside here. ",,
2023,D,73.5,180,,,32,Oliver Bonk,"Bonk's toolkit looks like an NHL defenseman. He's a 6-foot-2 right shot with strong mobility and offensive touch. Bonk is able to skate pucks up ice, make some skilled plays, and shows good poise from the blue line. He's not a standout with the puck, but he can be a decent puck mover at higher levels. Defensively he's solid due to his feet and reach. Bonk isn't overly physical but he can defend well enough as a pro. He projects as a top-four defenseman in the NHL.","Bonk was an important player on a strong London team this year, which isn’t always the case for defencemen his age under the Hunter brothers with the Knights, and speaks to the maturity of his game. He’s a pro-built defenceman who plays a firm game, possesses good overall skill, has solid edgework and directional changes, and escapes pressure well. He influences the game through his effectiveness and the consistency of his habits. He just looks like he’s going to be a solid two-way pro defenceman, though I would contend he has a high floor and a relatively low ceiling. He projects as a No. 4/5 defenceman.","Bonk has been a steady force on the London blueline this season. He isn’t the flashiest most dynamic player out there, but he makes all the plays and isn’t talked about much. For guys like him, that is best. He does an extremely good job controlling gaps and has an extremely active stick. He effectively shut down many top OHL units and was also able to chip in offensively with 40 points in 67 games. All those points with just about no powerplay time, which was eaten up mostly by Logan Mailloux and Sam Dickinson. Bonk reminds me a ton of T.J. Brodie, and should a team come away from day 2 of the draft with T.J. Brodie, they should be ecstatic. ","A true two-way defenseman who can produce points and pester opposing forwards in the defensive zone, Bonk’s versatility is his best asset. He skates well enough, has good enough size and is a right-shot. His offensive skillset may not portend to a high level of production at the NHL level, but his ability to take care of his own end, engage physically and break up plays to get pucks up ice is certainly attractive.",,"A right-shot defender with advanced defensive habits, reasonable size, and projectable skating? It’s no wonder NHL teams are highly interested in Oliver Bonk. He’s unlikely to ever be a real point producer, but he could eat up a lot of minutes down the line. The type of player a team wins with in the playoffs. Likely goes earlier than this.",,
2023,RW,72.25,210,,,33,Koehn Ziemmer,"Ziemmer is a highly-skilled and creative forward who has played center and wing but is likely a winger as a pro. Ziemmer has high-end hands and beats a lot of defenders one-on-one. He has the brain to run a power play and makes tough plays consistently at even strength. Ziemmer has the offensive touch, it’s all about whether his style of play will work in the NHL given his skating stride. His skating is quite upright and rigid, somewhat like Jason Robertson's, and creates concerns on his pro projection. Ziemmer has some physicality in his game, and can play around the net, but I wouldn't call him a high-energy type. I think he plays games but the skating questions will remain until he proves they don't in terms of projecting him having a long NHL career.","Ziemmer is a December 2004 who was selected with the No. 4 pick in the 2019 Bantam Draft (a year ahead of when most of the plethora of other top WHL names on this list were selected). Last year, he led Prince George in goals (30) and finished second in points (57, one back of Heidt). This year, he finished in the WHL’s top 10 in goals (41) and points (89), though he has regressed a little after a hot start. He’s a strong, physically mature winger (some of which is a benefit of his 2004 birthday, some of which is him carrying a little too much weight, but some of which is obviously also a credit to the work the muscle he also has) who likes to shoot the puck and shoots it hard, but also regularly beats defenders and goalies one-on-one with a slick set of hands across his body so that they can’t plan for the shot. He has scored some highlight-reel goals in the WHL but he also excels at finding pockets of space off of coverage and remaining involved on offence and defence. And while he’s probably not going to be a star at the next level, and his skating needs some work, I like Ziemmer as a potential middle-six winger who can contribute offensively in a variety of ways, works hard, can play a heavy game on pucks or operate in and out of give-and-gos. He may be an early Day 2 guy when it’s all said and done but I’m a believer in him as a first-rounder.","Ziemmer is a power forward build that excels when the puck is on his blade. He’s got a great shot with the ability to change angels quickly and is an great at weaving around defenders with shoulder fakes and quick stickhandles. Defensively he can become mis engaged quite quickly, but he does do a good job intercepting cycle plays and hard rims around the boards. Where Ziemmer slips below his counter parts is the skating. His stride mechanics are extremely wonky, and his being hunched over paired with extreme ankle flexion causes for some trouble to accelerate and the rate needed to keep up at the pro level. ","With 41 goals and 89 points in 68 games, Ziemmer showed off a vast offensive toolkit. The hockey sense and skill are high end traits, but his skating is a big concern at this point. Guys that think the game and have the offensive creativity like Ziemmer does give themselves a chance, but you’ve got to be able to play at a higher pace as you move up the ranks.",,,,
2023,C,71.75,166,,,34,Oscar Fisker Molgaard,"Molgaard has a play style that will translate to playing versus men. He's a strong skater with a powerful, quick stride. He also has a directness to how he plays. He pushes the pace, and takes pucks to the net. Molgaard has an average-sized frame but doesn't shy from traffic. He has very good hands and can make tough plays through opponents and to his teammates as well. I can see him being a middle six forward, and while his frame may push him to the wing, he has some of the traits to be a third-line NHL center as well.","A Danish prospect, Molgaard played 41 games in the SHL this season with HV71 (where he averaged just under 10 minutes per game and occasionally pushed 15 or 16 minutes) and led the Division 1A U18 Worlds in goals, assists, points, and plus-minus as the tournament’s top forward award winner to help Denmark to a silver medal and nearly promotion into the top flight. Molgaard plays a driven, hard-working game that blends above-average skill with strong skating to push tempo, get after it, and make quick plays and decisions with the puck. His skill isn’t flashy but he plays to positive results, drives results, and projects as an everyday centre.","Simply put, Oscar Fisker Molgaard needs to be talked about a whole lot more than he is right now. The 6’0” 165 lb center didn’t leave his home country of Denmark for Sweden until the 2021-22 season, and less than 18 months later he found himself centering the second line on HV71’s SHL squad. Fisker Molgaard is a highly intelligent, hardworking center who displays an advanced understanding of inside play both offensively and defensively. He’s a strong skater and is constantly in motion, scanning and surveying the ice in front of him. Despite his slight frame, he’s capable of winning puck battles vs. players far bigger and heavier than he is due to his high compete level and tenacity. Though the tools and flashes of playmaking are apparent and intriguing, it’s unclear just how much point production there will be at the NHL. The playmaking can be inconsistent and he doesn’t boast an NHL calibre shot to this point. There are questions about just how much offensive upside there is at the next level, and that may be a deciding factor in whether he hears his name called on day 1 or day 2. Still, the recent upward trajectory and the high-end tools make him an intriguing player to track as we get closer to June. ","You’ll never miss Molgaard on the ice, that’s for sure. He plays with pace and is on pucks in a hurry. His ability to hunt pucks could carry him a long way. On top of that, he has the offensive ability to make some plays and finish chances. He appeared in 41 SHL games this season as a U18 player and didn’t look out of place because his motor is always running.",,"won’t blow you away with individual skill. Instead, his value comes from the sum of his parts. Offensively, he uses his plus-level skating to drive through the dotted line, opens up space for mates, creates lanes through speed changes, and takes sparkling routes on the forecheck. In the defensive zone, the Danish forward is deft at assessing and recognizing threats, clogging lanes, and disrupting opportunities. His trusted deployment in the SHL and at men’s World Championships speaks to that awareness and maturity. This is a sneaky player who could end up being a vital cog in a team’s future.",,
2023,C,75,185,,,35,David Edstrom,"Edstrom is a well-rounded center with size who isn't overly flashy but has a lot of NHL traits. Edstrom is good around the net, kills penalties, wins a lot of battles and makes enough plays with the puck to produce good offensive numbers. He has good hands, and can create offense with pace. His skating for his size is intriguing and grew on me as the season went along. He has the makings of a potential top six two-way center in the NHL.","One of Sweden’s best players as their first-line centre at U18 Worlds after a good season split between Frolunda’s J20 and SHL team, Edstrom has been a steady riser this season, establishing himself as a borderline-dominant player against his peers and demonstrating he can hang against men. His stride is a little stilted and he’s not a great skater, but he’s good in very effective kind of way. He can also play with power or play with skill, which blends to allow him to take pucks off the wall to the inside and then execute in congested areas in ways you wouldn’t necessarily expect out of a 6-foot-3 player. He’ll make a soft-area play one second and then drive out of it the next. At an early age, it’s also clear he has a really mature understanding of how to use his size to his advantage. He looks to dictate with his length and knows how to position himself against defenders. He projects as a solid third-line centre who can contribute on both special teams.","Edstrom is projected third line center at the next level. He has been effective with two-way play in J18, J20 and in the SHL this season. He’s got great side to side speed from his crossovers that allows him to pounce on attackers behind the red line. Edstrom is defensively responsible and sits back in the neutral zone when the oppositional rush breaks out. He’s got an active stick and has good reach to rely on when scooping up loose pucks. Edstrom is solid with his distribution and uses whatever space is given to him. He does a great job of spotting potential passing lanes for his teammates to use and skates into them timely. That has paved the way for goals at net front.","A center with size, good skating ability and skill can be hard to find. At 6-foot-3 with plenty of time to tack on strength and fill out his frame, Edstrom has good touch on the puck and knows how to get around the ice. Off the puck, he’s responsible, but it’s what he can do in the offensive zone that will continue to draw interest. He was a point-per-game player in the U20 ranks and put up four points in 11 SHL appearances. The World U18 Championship left no doubt as to how Edstrom stacks up against his peers. He needs more polish, but his athletic toolkit suggests major upside.",,"David Edstrom ticks a lot of boxes that NHL teams look for. A 6-foot-3 centre with across-the-board skills and a mature two-way style? There’s a reasonable chance that he’s gone on Day One. But if not, he won’t last long on.",,
2023,G,78.75,215,,,36,Michael Hrabal,"With Hrabal the tools are obvious as a 6-foot-6 goalie who moves quite well for his size. He is efficient in his movements but can make the tough saves across his crease when he needs to. His puck-tracking isn't perfect, but generally I've liked his reads and ability to stay with the play. He has the best chance to be a starter in this class. I can see him as a potential tandem goalie or even a legit No. 1.","Early on this season, when Hrabal arrived from Czechia’s junior league and took the USHL by storm, putting up gaudy numbers through September and into early November, there was first-round buzz about him. Here was this massive goalie with an impressive track record. Then he hit a really rough rut into the new year, lost his job for a spell, only to regain form in March and April, both down the stretch with the Lancers and then as one of the top three players on Czechia at U18 Worlds, where I thought he was mostly excellent.

The size jumps out at you right away, but there are layers, good and bad, to the rest of his game. Hrabal gets down into his butterfly a little slowly, opening up his five-hole for shooters (a common problem for bigger goalies). Once he’s on his knees he actually scrambles well for a goalie as tall as he is. He’s got a good glove hand but has a tendency to try to catch low shots instead of making a pad save, I suspect because he doesn’t trust his rebound control on quick shots. I’ve seen him look completely in command, fill the net, and take everything away from shooters, and I’ve also seen him look clumsy and off-kilter. I would like to see him working on his game playing the puck. The upside is hard to ignore though and a team is going to be on it higher than this ranking.","Hrabal does project to be a starting NHL goaltender, but there are a few areas in his game that will need refinement in order to get him NHL ready. I’d like to see Hrabal shift quicker to shooting threats who are in back door areas. When in the butterfly, he is struggling to shift over in time and take on shots squared up. With that said, Hrabal is forced to make more desperation saves. In addition, as I just mentioned in the hyperlinked report, he also needs to address reading the trajectory and reacting with a well-placed glove extension on far side shots.

Hrabal does offer great post security, quick re-shifting when standing up, athleticism and the ability to maintain sight lines when traffic intensifies at the crease. Those attributes are exactly what I’m looking for in a goaltender. Hrabal does have some areas to work on, but offers more than others in the 2023 NHL goaltending class.","The best goaltender in the draft this season, Hrabal has remarkable physical tools that NHL teams covet. At 6-foot-6, he has above-average size for a goalie and matches that with excellent coordination and stability in the crease. He doesn’t waste a lot of movements and plays with control. He’s able to fight through traffic to find pucks, and moving pucks across the crease doesn’t guarantee you’ll beat him. 

Hrabel has some explosiveness going side to side, but his ability to stay so big in the net while sliding can frustrate opponents. He's put up excellent numbers on a team that has allowed a lot of shots. Hrabal faces more than 36 shots a game on average. Committed to UMass, whichever NHL team drafts Hrabal will have some added flexibility in how they handle his development in that they won’t have to burn a contract on him terribly soon. 

I have often hedged significantly on draft-eligible goalies, but he fits the mold of many of the other goalies that have gone in the first round recently and in some cases shows a higher ceiling thanks to his size and technique.",,,,
2023,C,70.75,155,,,37,Gracyn Sawchyn,"Sawchyn is a talented forward with the speed and skill to create offense at higher levels. He also has a mentality to attack the middle of the offensive zone which is something you like to see from a 5-foot-11 forward to go with a little chippiness. I wouldn't call his offensive game truly top end for the NHL, but he can beat opponents with his hands and makes a lot of plays. I would like to see him finish more of the chances he gets, though. His skating stride is awkward looking, but has pro power in it. Sawchyn has a chance to make it due to his various assets, and I can see him play games, although I'm hesitant to stamp him as a full-time player because it's not clear what his NHL role would be as a smaller forward without high-end offensive traits.","After leaving the national program to join the contending Thunderbirds this season, Sawchyn found a way to showcase his obvious skill level on the puck while playing on arguably the deepest team in the CHL. He’s got extremely quick hands that give him legitimate one-on-one skill and regularly flash in dangling sequences inside the offensive zone. He can beat defenders in transition or in traffic and does a really nice job holding onto pucks, drawing attention, delaying and then hitting seams as they open. He’s a light 157 pounds, but defenders have a tough time marking him. I like his competitiveness in battles and on the puck as well. Add in some positional and special-teams versatility (he can play centre or the wing, and the power play and penalty kill) and you’ve got my interest. I expect his production to take a big leap next year. A little more strength could take him a long way.","Sawchyn has excellent vision and does well at taking advantage of situations with limited space. He will get the pass off. Sawchyn is constantly looking to re-position himself as his teammates shift their own positioning so that way he can constantly provide his teammates with quality passing lanes should they need to pass. That has lead to goals at 5v5 for Sawchyn. 

I believe that Sawchyn can be a well-rounded offensive asset at the NHL in a middle six role. But with where Sawchyn is right now in his development, I would put deploy him as a winger instead of a center. He doesn’t have a power stride yet. If he does develop a strong power stride, I would definitely without a doubt deploy him at center because the combination of his handling, mobility and strong north-south strides would pave the way for Sawchyn to create more chances on his own with the puck in medium and high danger. In addition, I want Sawchyn to have the ability to create opportunities for himself off puck and he’d have far less of those opportunities mid-cycle in a center role. Also, you have to consider that he is usually isn’t the primary transporter in the neutral zone. But, if he can develop that power stride then I’d want to him to move into a center role as his role with possession of the puck would lead to far more scoring chances at center given the many tools that he has in the toolbox. ","One of the more gifted puckhandlers in the draft, Sawchyn has creativity and the ability to extend plays with his sure-handedness. He averaged a point per game on one of the best teams in junior hockey and has the hockey sense to make a lot of good things happen. Next year, he’ll likely be in a more prominent role for the Thunderbirds as many of their best players graduate out of junior. That should be good for his development as he has a special skill level as it appears the puck is glued to his stick at times. ",,"Gracyn Sawchyn owns some of the most electric puck skills in the class. He can maneuver in traffic, he can connect plays through tough seams, and he has a sizeable amount of pushback in his game. However, he was also buried on the Memorial Cup finalist Seattle Thunderbirds roster and was not afforded the same level of skill to work with as most other top prospects. The 5-foot-11, 157-pound forward is highly divisive among evaluators. Some see his terrific upside, others see a real wild card.",,
2023,D,71,181,,,38,Tanner Molendyk,"Moldenyk is a strong two-way defenseman despite not being the biggest defender. This is because of his excellent skating ability and strong work ethic. Molendyk's edgework is very good. He closes on checks like a pro, and is able to evade pressure at a high level. His top speed is good, not great, but he can lead a rush in the NHL. Molendyk has strong offensive instincts and skills, and can make plays from off the blue line and on the move. His size will be a minor issue as a defenseman in the NHL, but he plays hard and doesn't shy from physical play often landing hard hits at the junior level. I think he checks a lot of boxes and projects to be a top-four defenseman.","One of the more mobile defencemen in the draft, Molendyk uses light edges to adjust and shape to coverage with ease in all four directions. He evades pressure and walks the line with the best of them in this class, displaying comfort on his heels and inside and outside edges. He’s also a competitive defender on both sides of the puck who plays tight, active gaps to use his feet to be disruptive or step up in transition. He drove results with the Blades, helping them into the third round of the WHL playoffs while playing behind 21-year-old overage defenceman and captain Aidan De La Gorgendiere on the power play. He doesn’t have high-end upside but I don’t think anyone who has watched Molendyk closely would be surprised if he become an effective, play-steering bottom-four defenceman on the back of his skating, comfort, and consistent decision-making. He really does have tremendous edges and is very smooth in possession.","Molendyk is great in transition. He’s got excellent crossovers that spark his coast to coast puck movement. But, should he run into obstacles he’s shown over and over that he loves to give and go. Over the course of the season, I saw his vast improvement with his shot especially at 5v5. It was particularly rusty towards the start of the year, but by mid-March Molendyk was lighting up the lamp routinely. While his shot improved, the next step will be work on shot selection as he is shot heavy from the point. In his own zone, Molendyk will throw his weight to cause puck disruption. Molendyk has a second pairing projection. ","An exceptionally mobile defenseman who can get pucks up ice in a hurry, Molendyk is an especially intriguing prospect. There are plenty of 5-11 defensemen that are starting to find roles in the NHL and while there’s a legitimate question about if his offensive tools are dynamic enough to get him up the lineup at the NHL level, Molendyk's skating is especially enticing. He can still stand to defend better, but having defensemen that can get pucks up ice as quickly as Molendyk does with either his feet or a good first pass has a lot of value in the modern NHL.",,"One of the top skaters in the class, Tanner Molendyk can lull you into a happy place simply by watching him generate speed through transition. The WHL defender is nearly untouchable between the blue lines when he ramps it up. However, his rushes don’t always end with high-danger chances as he’s prone to missing options or giving up on plays at the sight of pressure. He defends the rush well and showed improvement in his retrievals and in-zone approach. But the hands and mind need some time to catch up with his feet.",,
2023,RW,68.75,175,,,39,William Whitelaw,"Whitelaw's game is full of pace due to his powerful skating stride. He'll be able to carry through the neutral zone at higher levels and create controlled entries with his speed and skill. I wouldn't call him an amazing playmaker, but he makes some creative passes and can make things happen off the flank with both his vision and shot. Whitelaw's compete is fine. He gets inside well enough, has some physicality and can win some battles but I wouldn't call his all-around game a strength and his effort level in general isn't great. He's a good junior and college player for sure, but the question is at 5-foot-9 is there anything really high-end about his game for the NHL to have a legit role on a team? As of now I lean to no on that question but his talent gives him a chance.","Whitelaw has some real believers around the USHL and it’s not easy to score 37 goals or 63 points in that league in your draft year, so I’m prepared for this to be a little low. I’ve had people tell me they think he’s turning into a bit of a star, but I just haven’t been wowed in my viewings. He’s a good, talented player without question. He’s a competitive guy too who fights his way from battle to battle and one skill play to the next. He can make plays in transition or make something happen out of nothing inside the offensive zone through a combination of will and skill. I just haven’t seen him really take over games as much as I’d like, though. I would sooner slot him higher than lower here.","I believe that Whitelaw is a top six winger at the NHL level. While he has played center in his youth, if you play him at center in the NHL, you would have to change his puck hunting approach and In my opinion that would be a huge mistake.

I would go with Conor Garland as a player comparison for Whitelaw. Like Garland, Whitelaw is tenacious in his pursuit of the puck in the offensive zone and does a great job with distribution when the pressure is on.

If you draft Whitelaw, you want him to keep developing his physical play in all three zones. He is constantly looking to pounce on attackers for the puck in the offensive zone, but it’s a little bit less prevalent in the neutral and defensive zones. In addition, I’d like to see Whitelaw work on his shot angling and pass to the slot more when pressure closes up on him. If Whitelaw replaces a few of his shots from distance when pressure is present to passes to the slot through tight lanes, his assist totals will go up. ","With outstanding hands and an ability to fool defenders with his high-end skill, Whitelaw is one of the truly gifted puck handlers in this draft. He put up big points in the USHL, was even better in the playoffs and added more bite to his game. Still, he does not have a big frame and at points can play too individualistic to have success at the professional level which is why there’s a fair amount of risk tied to him.",,,,
2023,D,72.05,190,,,40,Caden Price,"Price is a strong skater who can skate pucks up ice well, and can close effectively on his checks. He has good skill with the puck and can take an extra second with the puck to make a play. He's not the most physically imposing defenseman either in size or with his physical play. He makes stops in junior due to his skating and decent-enough sense and compete. I think he will be a full-time third-pair defenseman who contributes but doesn't stand out at either end. .","One of the younger players in the draft due to his late-August birthday, Price impressed scouts with his creativity and vision at last summer’s Hlinka Gretzky Cup and was Kelowna’s most productive defenceman as a 17-year-old this season. He’s got good size and sees the ice at an advanced level, consistently executing east-to-west plays and passes through coverage. He plays the game with confidence, transports the puck smoothly, and can use his feet to influence play. I would like to see him scan and shoulder-check a little more defensively, as he can be prone to mistakes going back to pucks or under pressure in his own zone. He’s got some work to do to put all of the pieces together but I expect him to take a big step next year.","Price started out the year as one of my top defensemen and a sure fire first rounder. As the season has played its course, my tune has changed quite drastically. He is a transition darling. He can get the puck up to the forwards quickly and get plays moving north quite effectively. There is some offensive upside with Price as he does generate some scoring opportunities with his above average passing and 4-way mobility. These skills open up lanes to the net for him to create. Defensively he has trouble at times holding a clean gap, but that is in large part because he like to pinch up and squeeze pucks against the wall. Understanding the time to activate and keep plays alive will allow Price to stay engaged in more plays throughout the course of a game. ","Beyond a good skating ability, I’m not sure you can say any one element of Price’s game stands out. He’s average sized, has average offensive capabilities, defends well enough and he’s got a good work ethic on the ice. He looks like he could round out into a bottom-pairing defenseman with a chance to boost his stock with a more refined offensive game.",,,,
2023,C,71,195,,,41,Oliver Moore,"Moore is the best skater in the draft. He has very good speed and his edgework is NHL-elite caliber. He evades pressure so well and is able to go from a stop to a fast gear very quickly. He has very good hands to go with those feet and projects to get a ton of controlled zone entries in the NHL. I don't think his pure offensive touch as a scorer or playmaker will ever dazzle, and he'll be more of a secondary scorer on an NHL line. Moore lacks size, and isn't overly physical, but he's a worker. He gets to the net, comes back hard on defense and coaches trust him in tough situations. He has a ton of NHL projectability and looks like a potential good top six forward, whether at center or the wing.","A hand injury kept Moore out of action late last year and prevented him from playing at U18 worlds as an underager, but he impressed me on three trips down to Plymouth these last two years (last November when he was already playing up, this fall for U18 Five Nations, this winter for the BioSteel All-American Game and again in Switzerland for this year’s U18 worlds. His consistent game-to-game impact, whenever I’ve sat down to watch the 2005s at the NTDP on tape, has struck me as well.

The U18 team’s first line of Smith, Ryan Leonard and Gabe Perreault piled up the points and attention (deservedly so) this year, but I’ve been as impressed by Moore and the offence he has created as the focal point of its second line from start to finish. Moore’s game is defined by his singular skating ability (both in straight lines, where he turns defenders with ease out wide, and in quick bursts from explosive stops and starts) and presence on the ice. He’s got gallops, cutbacks, crossovers, all of it. I’ve seen him create breakaways with ease, win races he shouldn’t, and send defenders sliding when he stops up on them with a head of steam. He also hunts pucks and applies pressure with the best of them, and his motor doesn’t stop, bouncing from one won battle to the next.

He wants to hang onto the puck and make plays but he’ll also hurry it up and dominate in and out of give-and-gos. He’s got an impressive one-timer from the right flank and can really lean into and rip his catch-and-release or in-stride wrister to score from the high slot. He has added a ton of strength since arriving at the program so that he can overwhelm junior-level players with his power and speed. He has learned to use some clever movement patterns to make defencemen miss and get to his spots as a shooter. He’s strong in the faceoff circle. Increasingly, his game isn’t all just about the speed/hound element and I’ve been impressed by his puck protection in and out of stops and starts in the offensive zone, changing directions to beat defenders off the all-into valuable ice.

I don’t see much to nitpick in either his tools or his approach. More and more his game has shown dimension inside the offensive zone so that he can make things happen shift after shift out of all of his effort plays up and under sticks. He just has a unique ability to impose his will on the game. And while his game is tenacious, he also has surprising soft skill. I’m not sure he has the star power of the names in front of him here, but he’s got some unique attributes in this class and he’s going to make a heck of an NHL player.","Oliver Moore has been consistently one of my favorite prospects in this draft class. He was one of the best puck transporters in transition in the entire North American draft class as he utilizes his speed, puck skill, and elite edges to exit and enter the zone. His wrist shot beat goalies clean from distance all year, and he looks to dangerous areas of the ice to make passes. I would’ve liked to see a more well rounded and puck dominant offensive zone game at the end of the year as he had Hagans and Eiserman on his line for a good portion of the second half. He is extremely engaged defensively and is hard on pucks. I think he projects as a perfect 3rd line center on a Cup contending team with the offensive tool kit to develop into a top 6 role. ","One of the quickest players in the draft, Moore’s skating ability is smooth yet explosive. He can beat defenders one-on-one and can take pucks wide to create extra time and space for his linemates. 

Moore also has the puck skills to make some plays at speed that challenge those trying to slow him down. He’s putting up big numbers this season, but gets overshadowed some by a few of the players that play higher in the lineup at the NTDP. Still, it’s impossible to miss Moore on the ice. Just look for the guy moving faster than everyone else.",,"The fastest player in the crop wasn’t afforded the same opportunities as his fellow USNTDP mates. But Oliver Moore still managed to show off his electric skating, quality handling, and dual-threat offensive generation. More of a read-and-react type of rusher, he’ll need some time for his brain to catch up with his feet.",,
2023,LW,77,203,,,42,Daniil But,"But is a large, highly skilled forward who can score. He makes a lot of crafty plays with the puck in small areas, and with his massive wingspan he's able to pull pucks past a lot of checkers. He can both make and finish plays well, but he's more of a goal scorer with a shot that can score from range. But isn't blazing fast and his stride technique is just OK, but for a 6-foot-5 guy he can motor up the ice quite well, has a strong first step and he'll be able to power his way to the net off rushes at higher levels. He gives a solid effort and is often involved in the play. Even though I don't see a high-end trait other than his size, But checks every box and projects to be a major part of an NHL lineup.","After playing on Russia’s Hlinka Gretzky team two summers ago, But played to a point-per-game level in the MHL as one of its top 2005s last season and began his draft year on a tear in the MHL, scoring 11 goals in his first 15 games of the season before earning a mid-October promotion to the KHL for the first time (he then scored his first two pro goals and bounced between the KHL and MHL). Scouts are drawn to him because of his size-skill combo and committed 200-foot game, and while he can look a little uncoordinated out there at times, he skates well for his size, his hands are nimble for his size, the draw is real and there are some definite tools there.

He’s excellent on the wall in puck protection and also has some outside-in skill so that he can attack off of holds into the middle third. He’s got impressive shooting mechanics given how long his stick is, and he regularly pulls pucks into his feet to change his angle face-up against goalies. I love the way he shields pucks and waits for his opportunities to attack. While he’s got some work to do to get a little quicker from the jump in the game’s 10-foot races, he does have some power and balance through his stride to build upon and skates pretty well for his size and age. It’s hard to be a true top-of-the-lineup forward at his size, though, and I think he projects more as a complementary scorer who gives a lineup a bit of a different look. There’s a lot to work with though, for sure.","But is a power winger who I believe has some of the highest upside in the entire draft. When he’s at his best, he’s dominant; using his massive frame and high-end small area skill to bully MHL and sometimes even KHL competition. From a pure tools standpoint, But is one of the best bets you can make; 6’5” with a ton of skill is always gonna be an enticing combination. He’s always been a good finisher with a good shot, and I’ve wanted to see him become more of a playmaker, because I think it suits his game very well, plus he’s a very good passer when he does do that thing; very good at drawing defenders away, opening passing lanes in a variety of ways, and his actual passing ability is quite good. And through my viewings, I feel like he has trended in that direction; his playmaking has improved and become more frequent over the course of the season, and I’m liking the new But quite a lot. So why 29? Well, the skating is a bit of a mess at times, and for a guy his size, his physical game is not quite where it needs to be; he should work on his puck protection, and using his body more effectively. But more than anything, there are still concerns in terms of the general decision-making area. It has improved, which gives reason to think it can keep improving, but a lack of scanning and awareness, and often just a poor understanding of the game in general it feels like, certainly isn’t what you want to see. Questioning a player’s sense and smarts as much as I do with But is a bit of a red flag to me. At the same time, the talent and potential is undeniable, and it’s difficult to pass up at this point. It’s easy to imagine a world in which he goes top 10 in a re-draft, maybe even top 5; but the risk could be nearly as high as his potential is. ","Casting a massive 6-foot-5 frame, But does not have tremendous quickness, but he has high-end hand skills. Not just good hands for a big guy, good hands period. He has an easy release on his shot and a nose for the net. With his size package and hand skills, if teams are chasing the next Tage Thompson, But might be the guy. There’s a rawness to him and the Russian factor will definitely play a role, but it’s hard to ignore the upside. ",,"A towering 6-foot-5 winger with quick hands, a heavy release, and creative vision. Daniil But exceptionally coordinated and dextrous with the puck for a player his size. At the same time, he’s far too upright which limits his power, balance, and overall ability to protect the puck. But if he can clean that up, look out.",,
2022,LW,76,218,1,MON,1,Juraj Slafkovsky,"Slafkovsky has all the assets you're looking for in a top NHL forward. He's a 6-foot-4 winger who can beat opponents with speed and skill. He possesses outstanding puck skills and can put pucks through legs and sticks at a very high rate. Slafkovsky can use finesse, or power and quickness to get around defenders. Slafkovsky can also set up and finish plays well. Physically, he won't run over guys but his compete is good enough. He projects as a top-line winger with the potential to pop and become a true star in the NHL.","Slafkovsky is one of the draft's most tantalizing prospects, with a skill-size combo that scouts and coaches clamour for and he has already demonstrated against pro competition domestically and, more notably, internationally. It has been a big year for him. Nine points in five games and a historic silver medal for the Slovaks at the Hlinka Gretzky Cup. An Olympic bronze medal as the tournament's MVP. A Liiga silver medal with his club team, TPS. A team-leading nine points at the men's worlds.

Slafkovsky is built like a power forward, with a 218-pound frame that makes him one of the draft's heaviest players, but he plays the game with uncharacteristic finesse, regularly flashing hands you'd expect out of a smaller player one-on-one to pull pucks in tight to his feet. He's also got a rangy, fluid stride, which makes him a surprisingly dangerous rush player — and impressive confidence with the puck on his stick, which enables him to hang onto it (sometimes to a fault) and attack off the wall into the slot (he loves taking the puck from the half wall to the home plate area to shoot from his forehand. The team that drafts him will be betting on his upside, which grades at or near the very top of this class.

I'm also a big fan of his approach. He has continued to play his style and look to attack in control (a lot of forwards his size become more deferential and fall back into give-and-go habits to fit a mould when they make the jump to the pro level) as he has played against higher and higher competition. There is, despite his makeup and success, some risk associated with his projection at his size (small players aren't the only ones who carry size-based limitations with them!) though, and that, combined with how much I like the four players I have slotted ahead of him here, does leave me a little lower on him than where he'll be picked, even if there's a real chance he becomes one of the two or three best players out of this draft.","Slafkovsky can be a menace at the NHL level. His stick-handling reach and his play on the cycle makes him a threat down low. If he can broaden his game by working on his long range shot, that allows him to become a dual threat. But, even if he doesn't become that dual threat offensively, he has the physicality and the reach to net pucks in puck battles and set up teammates in the slot. With that said, I can envision him being a top six contributor at the NHL level.","The potential of what Slafkovsky can be as he continues on in his development is intoxicating. A 6-foot-4 winger with physicality, high-end skill and one of the better overall shots in this draft, it's hard not to get excited. There is a chance that he ends up being the No. 1 pick in this draft and may one day be viewed as its best player. He's every bit as good as the other two players listed ahead of him on talent alone.

I've watched Slafkovsky a lot this year and while I am enamored with the physical tools and skills, there's not a ton of precedent for the kind of season he had, where he produced at a rate far below expectations of a top-five NHL draft pick in his league season yet was off the charts internationally. In the end, the largest sample we have to judge is that from his club season with TPS. You look at players from the Liiga that have gone early in drafts and all of them had better numbers than Slafkovsky, and many of them had better numbers by a lot. It's not something that is easily ignored. Among U18 players who have played at least 20 games in the Liiga as U18 players, Slafkovsky's 0.32 points per game ranks 35th and 21st overall in the last 10 years.

Slafkovsky is a classic eye-test darling and that's a big reason why I have him in this range. If he hadn't played so well in those international events, I'm not sure we're having this discussion at all. But he did play in those games and we got to see a physically dominant young player who held his own against pros and eventually became one of his team's most important players. The Olympics and World Championship fields were not NHL-caliber competition, but they were significant stages on which Slafkovsky broke out against professionals. I also think his progression over the season and playing with confidence down the stretch significantly altered how well he played for the better. 

This is a tough case to read, because we have a body of work that suggests he's statistically not among top-tier players in his own league historically, but we have this immense skillset that is so unique in this draft class that it's impossible to overlook. I think Slafkovsky is right in the mix with Cooley and Wright to be the best players in this class, and even though I know what the numbers say, I can't get past the incredible ceiling I believe his size-and-skill package creates.","Slafkovsky is one of the largest players in the first round and also possesses the largest upside of anyone in the class. A rocket of a shot, soft hands, and an improving skating stride all packaged into a 6-foot-4, 220-pound frame. His ability to make plays in space is great, but he'll need to do it without that time as well. He could be a unicorn.  ","Nothing brought out Juraj Slafkovsky's draft year best quite like the opportunity to wear his country's colours and represent Slovakia in international competition. He's the ultimate patriot.
Slafkovsky started the scouting season off as if shot from a cannon, putting up nine points in five games en route to a silver medal at the Hlinka-Gretzky in August. Next up, seven goals in seven games and MVP honours as he led Slovakia to the bronze medal at the Beijing Olympics. Then, lastly, a point a game clip at the World Hockey Championships in Finland. All this in his age-17 season.
It's not like he was chopped liver in the Finnish Liiga either. Ten points in 31 games is hardly anything to scoff at from a first-time draft-eligible skater  in one of Europe's more challenging professional leagues, after all.
The appeal with Slafkovsky is obvious: He's a 6-foot-4 playmaking power forward with soft hands, shooting skill, and the sort of wall game that would already rate as an above-average quality in the NHL.
The first thing you notice is just how easily he retains possession under duress. It's like watching a bully play keep away, one hand stiff-arming his victim out of reach and the other one waving their stolen item to mock them for good measure. If Slafkovsky wants the puck, then he takes the puck, and good luck getting it back.
That we've mostly seen this from the Slovak winger in professional settings this season just makes it that much more impressive. It's one thing to ward off physically undeveloped 17-year-olds in the WHL; it's another thing entirely to swat away seasoned veterans in Finland's top men's league like they're mosquitos.
Slafkovsky brings a lot more to the table than just brute force, though. What makes him a unique prospect is how he turns those extended possession sequences into legitimate scoring chances. Sometimes, it's a drive to the net-front for a chance of his own; other times, he'll handle his way into a passing opportunity and send the puck to his linemate to finish the job.
Where Slafkovsky often leaves our staff wanting, though, is with his footspeed. The deficiencies are many, whether it's his posture, a heel kick out of recoveries, or a hop in his crossovers. He just cannot separate from opponents in space. To Slafkovsky's credit, we've already seen considerable growth from him as a skater this season, and there isn't any reason to believe he won't continue on that path as he rises up the ranks. It's probably an about-average tool at this point, which is a pretty big step up on where he started the season. Don't be surprised if you hear Slafkovsky's name called as high as first overall in July's draft. Players with his skill set are so rare. Teams guard these players closely when they have them, and they move heaven and earth to find one when they don't. I mean, who wouldn't want a high-scoring top-six winger with a physical side? That's the upside with Slafkovsky.","Slafkovsky dominated the international scene this past season, solidifying himself as my number two pick in the NHL draft this season.  Over the last year, Slafkovsky played at the World Juniors, the Olympics, and World Championships. His most dominating performance came at the Olympics, where he led Slovakia to a Bronze Medal and received MVP honors, a remarkable feat for an 18-year-old.

Slafkovsky is an intriguing prospect with an absurd overall physical and offensive package. At 6'4 and well over 200 pounds, Slafkovsky is strong on the puck and uses his frame in a physical manner. Yet, he has incredible hands and can make plays in-tight like few players can in this draft class. This is what makes Slafkovsky so unique. He's a player with size and high skill that can dominate down-low or in open ice.

While he dominated at the international level against men, Slafkovsky struggled to put up points at times in Finland's top league. However, scouts aren't too concerned and believe higher numbers will come with time. Slafkovsky may make the jump to the NHL immediately next season due to his physical maturity but will likely need at least another season of development to further his offensive game.","Juraj Slafkovsky drives offense from the wing. He's a massive winger who has made a strong case to challenge for first overall. He can play at a high pace and has impressive agility for someone his size.  Using strong strides with his long legs, he can generate a lot of speed with just a few steps. While he lacks that extra gear to create separation, it's how well he protects the puck when challenged that makes up for any speed or burst concerns that may follow him. With strong stickhandling and the ability to move the puck in tight, he can control possession as well as the pace of the play. On-ice awareness in all three zones is another aspect of his game where he excels, making the extra effort on backchecks as well as going down low to support his blueliners when defending. He also uses his stick very well, taking advantage of his long reach to win battles to loose pucks. He has such immense offensive potential that it can be frustrating to see him pass up great scoring opportunities for himself and teammates. Learning how to take what's given to him and remove moments of tunnel-vision from his game is something he will need to improve on to be a more consistent impact player when attacking. His unique blend of size and skill could make him a dominant player at the NHL level. He is the ultimate swing on upside while still having a solid floor. If he becomes the player he is capable of developing into, there is little doubt Slafkovsky will be a force at the NHL for the next 15 years and people will wonder why there was even a debate about the top pick in this class. If he doesn't hit his that potential, he's still got potential as a top-six scoring winger who impacts the game regularly."
2022,C,72.5,193,4,SEA,2,Shane Wright,"Wright is a very well-rounded center who has no noticeable flaw in his skill set but there also isn't a ton about his game that gets you overly excited. He can skate and handle the puck like an NHLer. Wright's game translates because of his compete and direct style of play. He takes pucks to the net and plays quick. He can pull up to make a tough pass but can take pucks to the interior too. He has the high-end vision to run a power-play unit and make tough plays with pace. His shot is very good, showing the ability to pick corners from long range consistently. Off the puck he's competitive and responsible, showing maturity beyond his years. He projects as a No. 1 center in the NHL due to his all-around play with a chance to be a star, but probably won't be an elite scorer in the league.","Still my top prospect in this class (though no longer in a tier of his own), Wright is an athletic kid who boasts a wide gait and boxy shoulders that balance him over pucks. Those physical tools are complemented by a lethal wrist shot release (which he can get off from several stances and pops off of his blade's heel or toe) and quick hands in traffic that allow him to take pucks off of the wall and create scoring chances to the interior. He's also one of the most diligent three-zone players in the draft, with a powerful stride that helps him push play up ice (though its power is more evident the length of the sheet than from a standstill into a quick foot race) when he's done providing support low in his zone or above the puck.

While his shot is his biggest weapon inside the offensive zone (I actually think he was owed a few more goals than his 35 on 290 shots this season gave him), he played a much more creative game inside the offensive zone into the second half. He blends versatile skill with a heady, detailed game that will allow him to drive a line and be relied upon in all situations down the middle at the next level. There are times when scouts want to see him play with a little more fire and feistiness to really take over games and impose himself on the forecheck/in battles more, but his eye for detail off the puck puts him in a supportive role more often than an active chase and that's fine.

I would have liked to see him hang onto the puck a little more this season, but he played with talented linemates where his ability to play into their strengths and execute off of give-and-go's worked. He's got pro tools and projects as an impactful top-six centre. He may not become a point per game player, but I see 30-goal, 70-point upside at a premium position.","The complicated and essential question to answer is, “What does this all mean looking forward?” There is no doubt that Shane's attention to detail style of play combined with intelligent and quick decision-making is the start of a valuable foundation for him to continue to build on as he progresses into the NHL. However, that package of skills and habits will only take him so far when he advances to play against more intelligent and faster competition. In the OHL, he infrequently shows off his high octane offense, which reasonably has caused doubts about his offensive ceiling. At this moment in time, it is likely premature to value these concerns heavily enough to knock him off the top spot in the 2022 draft class. However, if these question marks around his offensive contributions still exist in July, it would be warranted to consider how his game will project to the NHL and if that assessment leads to a consensus 1st overall player.

The expectation for Wright (or any prospect for that matter) should not be to save the franchise or to be a generational talent, as he will most likely disappoint. A reasonable projection for Wright would be in the range of a low-end 1st line to a high-end 2nd line center, which to some may sound pessimistic in the context of 1st overall. Still, it is an essential piece to have on a successful team and is not easy to acquire. In addition, Shane will likely benefit from being paired with skilled wingers, who can allow Shane to focus on pushing play up ice to the offensive zone where his linemates can flourish. Finally, with his shot, he will surely be a continual threat on the powerplay, where he has consistently shown he can score from many angles and distances.","With high-end hockey sense highlighted by his tremendous offensive intelligence, Shane Wright can make a lot of plays. While he lacks a dynamic puck skills in terms of handling, he has one of the better shots in this draft class with a quick, deceptive release. Though he has often been compared to Patrice Bergeron, I think Wright is a good two-way player but not to the degree where that is an especially apt comparison. He does a lot of the things you hope a center does in terms of puck possession, making plays and contributing in his own end. The offensive elements of his game are the standout traits for me.

My biggest concern with Wright to date is the general lack of progression in his game year over year, with the full knowledge that he missed an entire season. While I think he should be graded on a curve as a result, it is harder to know just how much that lost season impacted his long-term projection. Wright's hockey sense is a separating factor from most of his peers and he clearly has that competitive drive that allow him to win a lot of battles. In the end, I think Wright does just about everything well. His hockey sense and his shot are high-end-to-elite traits, he has terrific vision and spots plays with the best of them, but the lack of a dynamic element to his play is what gives me the most concern aside from his progression. 

I have been waiting all season to see a player who looks like he should be a No. 1 NHL Draft pick, and I did not feel his ceiling is at the same level as Slafkovsky's or Cooley's. Wright is the safer pick of all three in that I think he has the highest floor of any of those three players and possesses an NHL-ready game. I don't think he's done developing and there's plenty of potential for him to still reach for, but my concern is that he's closer to plateauing than the other two players. I'm not convinced that's true yet, but it's definitely in the back of my mind as I rank these players because, to me, all three are very close.","The top player from the class held this position from tip to tail on my board. Wright is a highly intelligent pivot who boasts a heavy release, deft passing touch, and the wherewithal to package those tools into their right situations. He lacks the separation speed you'd like from an elite centre but makes up for it with his nuanced understanding of the game. Wright can connect plays, drive action, dish it or finish it, and thwart plays against. He's going to be good. ","In a draft year shaped by substantial depth rather than overwhelming star power, it's almost fitting that the least exciting option at first overall is the right one. Better still, the Shane Wright one, if you'll allow us that clunky pun.
That Wright would end up in that spot may have seemed like a foregone conclusion a year or two ago, but the gap year that the OHL's lost 2020-21 season forced on Wright (and countless others) left him slow out of the gates. Two months of good-not-great production was enough to make the question of the first overall pick an open one for many in the industry, with new answers emerging first in the form of Logan Cooley and then later in Juraj Slafkovsky.
In time, though, Wright reminded the scouting community of his quality, ending many (not all…) of those conversa-tions emphatically. The 1.15 point per game clip that he ran through October and November turned to 1.36 by the end of the calendar year. From there, it just kept climbing until Wright had amassed 94 points in 63 regular season contests by the season's end, good for a 1.49 point per game clip.
It's still the lowest draft year points per game mark of any first overall pick out of the CHL this side of Rick Nash in 2001, but a more selective and perhaps representative sample from December onward gets Wright to 1.63 points per game. That's more than Nico Hischier in 2017 and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins in 2011, for context.
Shifting our focus from the question of how many to how, Wright is this draft's premier play-connector; an on-ice ad-ministrator through which his team's offensive and defensive sequences flow.
By constantly surveying the ice, Wright maintains a mental map of his surroundings with a downright topographical level of detail. He knows the position of his teammates like they're a long-established fact rather than a dynamic, changing set of options on the playing field, and moves the puck to them with a matching level of confidence.
Look-off passes, the give-and-go, one- and two-touch passes, reach-adjusted passing -- Wright mastered every one of these tools en route to becoming one of the game's best playmaking centres not currently in the NHL. his cunning as a distributor with a high-level shot (even if it's a little peculiar from a mechanical perspective) that's especially potent off of the pass and some of the best hands in the class. He's the complete package offensively.
We would, of course, feel better about Wright's shot if he used it a little more judiciously rather than settling for low percentage attempts under pressure, but that's a minor quibble for as scalable an offensive toolkit as you'll find in this class.
Then there's his play in the defensive zone. Wright's de-fensive reads, angles, and support play are beyond reproach. There may not be an Art Ross in his future, but the Frank J. Selke seems well within reach. We don't make the Patrice Bergeron comparison lightly, after all.
All of these factors combined to make Wright the consensus first overall pick for the Elite Prospects scouting staff. You just don't come across many players this polished or this well-rounded at 18-years-old, and that's too much to pass up on if you're holding the first pick in this July's draft.","Wright has been on the radar of scouts for a long-time now. He received exceptional status to play in the OHL as a 15-year-old and put up amazing numbers at the time. Unfortunately, he did not play last season because of COVID restrictions in Ontario. Despite the missed time, Wright captained Canada to an Under-18 Gold Medal in 2021 and put up 94 points this season.  

Wright is potentially the most well-rounded player in the draft. He does everything really well, in all zones. He plays a mature game and has strong leadership qualities. Wright originally looked like more of a goal-scorer in his 15-year-old season, but he has rounded out his playmaking as well in the past year or so. He finished top 10 in OHL scoring.

Wright's biggest asset is his shot and his ability to generate scoring opportunities. He can drive a line on his own, making him a potential number one center at the NHL level. Some scouts question his offensive ceiling for a potential number one pick, but he could easily put up 30 goals and 70 points at the NHL level with regularity. Wright should jump into full-time NHL duty next season.","Shane Wright is an elite two-way center with incredible offensive ability. It's not often you watch players where you really struggle to find too many weaknesses at this level, but he has been that way for a while now. His intelligence on the ice is second-to-none and on full display in his playmaking, his lane pursuit, and his awareness. Wright adds a pro caliber shot to his toolbox that will allow him to be a multi-dimensional offensive threat at the NHL level, sooner rather than later. He's so mature in his defensive game and because of that, he is just as effective defensively as he is offensively. He knows the nuances of playing the center position and can properly support his defenders on every play. He never seems to be caught out of position and remains engaged and effective on both the rush and the cycle. The biggest issue with Wright's game this season was his inconsistent offensive production. Through the Christmas break, he wasn't producing the way a top-tier draft eligible prospect would in the OHL, but he put most of the questions about his production to rest with his amazing second-half explosion. There was an odd amount of discourse surrounding Wright's stature as the top player in this class given the way his season went. While it wasn't completely unwarranted, it is important to remember he missed essentially the entire 2020-21 season due to the pandemic, and had insane expectations coming off his rookie season. The way Wright rebounded in the latter half of the year showed enough to remind people why he can be a future top-line center in the NHL for years to come and why he is considered the odds-on favorite to be the number one selection in the NHL Draft."
2022,D,72,190,2,NJD,4,Simon Nemec,"Nemec is a very well-rounded defenseman. His puck game is great. He has the high-end brain to make a lot of tough plays often. Nemec can hit seams, make plays under pressure and makes a great outlet pass. He also shows individual skill which, when combined with good speed, allows him to be dangerous in transition too. Defensively he's solid due to his skating, compete and brain, even though he's not imposing physically and can be trusted with tough responsibilities. Nemec projects as a top-pair defenseman.","This kid turned 18 in the middle of February and he's already registered 65 points in 112 games at a professional level as a defenceman! Nemec's statistical profile is as strong as any draft-eligible defenceman we've seen in recent years — and stronger than any player in this draft class. A poll of NHL scouts still gives Czech defenceman David Jiricek the slight edge, but I'd argue Nemec only further stamped what I believe to be the better case with his exceptional, record-setting play in Nitra's playoff run and into the men's world championships. This is a kid who has looked a class above his peers whenever he's played with them, has excelled against NHLers on the senior stage, and is already a top player at his position in his top domestic league (albeit a difficult one to evaluate).

Nemec is a calculated and poised three-zone defender who is capable of organizing play from the top of the zone, executing through seams in coverage at a high level, and starting and leading his fair share of rushes. He's got great edges and four-way mobility. And he also regularly flashes sneaky deception, which blends beautifully with his rare maturity for his age. Though I wouldn't say he's a dynamic, game-breaking type offensively, I see plenty of calmness and talent, he knows when and how to push (and when and how to sit back and defend), he's already got pro size, he plays a polished game, and he's a righty. I expect him to become the best defenceman out of Slovakia since Zdeno Chara and a true No. 2 (and maybe even No. 1) guy who plays an effective, efficient, play-driving modern game. The game just comes easy to him.","With Nemec, you are netting a top pairing defender. While some of the report might scream that he is stronger offensively than he is defensively, he is well-rounded and well-adversed to defending the rush and neutralizing threats in his own zone.","One of the very best passers in this draft, Nemec racked up a ton of assists this season with high-level vision and decisiveness with the puck on his stick. He finished with 26 points in 39 games in Slovakia's top pro league. The only U18 players to produce at a higher level at the same age as Nemec were forwards Marian Hossa and Marian Gaborik. And that was just the regular season. In the playoffs this year, Nemec had 17 points over the 19 games, by far a record in the league for a U18 player, though Marian Hossa's 1.43 points per game in the 1997 postseason will remain the high-water mark on a per-game rate. What Nemec did this year is largely unprecedented for a U18 defenseman. 

Nemec is clearly an intelligent offensive defenseman who defends at an average level. He is best with the puck on his stick, pushing pucks up ice and making plays. The offensive toolkit and offensive sense he possesses is clearly advanced for his age. His skating is at a high enough level and I think his overall hockey sense puts him among the top tier in this draft. That said, I think there are some limitations to his defensive game and there is a lot more he has to do to get detail in his game. He had a full green light it seemed at Nitra, which is incredible confidence in a young guy, but we also got to see how often that could let him get out of position and create some headaches for his ‘D' partner. I think as he gets better at picking his spots, he could be a lethal offensive force for whichever team drafts him. I think he projects comfortably into a top-four role, but I just have a little more confidence in Jiricek having a No. 1 defenseman ceiling compared to Nemec.","The statistical comparables to Nemec's draft year in the Tipos Extraliga are basically non-existent. He broke nearly every U21 record for defenders in the top Slovak league and shone for his nation in most international events. Nemec is a right-shot kid with swagger and a mind for play creation. More of a problem-solver than a planner in transition, but has the tools to get away with it. He added creativity and shiftiness throughout the season. There's a top-pair upside here.","Šimon Nemec just put together the most productive draft year season from a defenceman in Tipos Extraliga history. In fact, Marián Hossa and Marian Gáborik are the only two other players in league history ever to best Nemec's 26 points in 39 games as a first-time draft-eligible skater.
Some of that is survivorship bias in action. Defencemen of Nemec's quality don't usually play their draft year in the Tipos Extraliga; they fly for the Czech Extraliga or any other number of more challenging professional settings.
The other part of the equation is that Nemec is just a really damn good hockey player. Even a less difficult (all things be-ing relative) professional setting is still a professional setting, and he deserves a due of credit for the way he handled the assignment. It's not like HK Nitra sheltered the 18-year-old Slovak blueliner; his 20:15 a night in ice-time, according to our partners at InStat, was third-highest on the team.
How did Nemec pull it off? By constantly making the right play at the right time and rarely if ever deviating from his team's structure.
You just won't find a more reliable, steady defenceman in this year's draft than Nemec. He isn't going to bring you out of your seat with any exhilarating displays of creativity or skill, but the trade-off is that he won't leave you shaking your head in disbelief at a poor decision or a costly turnover either.
That posture isn't for a lack of skill or NHL-level tools. If anything, the opposite is true. We view Nemec as one of the draft's more toolsy defencemen, with above-average skating, handling, shooting, and passing skill. His one-timer is a veritable cannon.
We also don't want you to get the idea that Nemec is strictly a stay-at-home defender either. While low percentage shots and an inability to create offensive advantages often marred our game reports for the 6-foot-1 blueliner, there was also a consistent appreciation for his offensive activations, be they on the rush or from the offensive blue line. He'll always take what's there.
You would like to see that skill on the rush translate as a neutral zone defender, but that part of Nemec's game is still a work in progress. A fairly accommodating gap and an inability to break down multivariable situations in space often conspired to leave the Slovak defensive prospect help-less on the rush. His skating base and sense are such that Nemec should be able to iron out these parts of his game with time, but for now anyway, they represent something of an Achilles heel in his game. Overall, though, Nemec has one of the highest floors in this class. It's all too easy to imagine a scenario where he's playing top-four minutes in the NHL, featuring in both phases of special teams, and leveraging his tools and sense for consistently good-not-great points totals. Any team would be happy to find such a player with a top-10 pick.
risk management ability goes away, and on the breakout, where the forecheck can force him into imprecise passes. He has the patterns, but not the hockey sense to back it up. ","Few players have been as dominant at the pro-level before their 18th birthday as Simon Nemec. With a whopping 65 points in 112 games as a defenseman, Nemec has shown his game is mature enough to play against men.

Nemec has all the makings of a modern-day first-pairing defenseman. An excellent skater, Nemec has a strong first pass and can keep and drive possession with his excellent instincts and puck mobility in the offensive zone. While strong offensively, he isn't a liability defensively either.  He anticipates the play well defensively and has excellent gap control. Nemec rarely panics under pressure with the puck and makes excellent seam passes when being forechecked against. He also has excellent hands, making him a strong two-way threat whenever he is on the ice.

Some scouts have David Jiricek above Nemec in this draft, but due to his proven production, I think Nemec has a slightly higher upside.  He is likely a year away from NHL duty and projects as a top-pairing defender.","Simon Nemec is a mobile two-way and highly-intelligent Slovak blueliner with all the makings of an elite top pairing defenseman. The standout in his game is his poise and confidence with the puck on his stick and how that is able to fuel his advanced playmaking game. He's a heads-up player at the offensive blue line, constantly surveying the offensive zone with his head on a swivel when the puck is on his stick to identify where teammates and potential offensive threats are. He's a smooth skater who is able to walk the line and use his legs to activate from the point when the puck is on his stick, allowing him to open up passing and shooting lanes with his mobility as well as making opposing checkers bite with his hands and shoulder fakes. His offensive vision is excellent, as he's capable of finding teammates with cross-ice passes to set up one-time opportunities and can feed teammates in the slot when handling the puck along the boards. He's a crisp and accurate passer who can deliver passes on the tape with purpose, as well as being capable of making soft finesse passes off both his forehand and backhand. He is also a more than capable puck-mover, as when he's working at his best his mobility, vision, and passing ability all combine to allow him to move pucks to teammates to start the breakout or move pucks himself. He's a capable defender who owns a good stick to breakup opposing rushes when defending in transition and he's generally well-positioned when defending in his own zone. In order to maximize his potential, Nemec will need to continue to work on his consistency in his reads to trim out some defensive turnovers out of his game, as well as show more growth in his strength and physicality."
2022,C,70.5,180,3,ARI,3,Logan Cooley,"Cooley is a dynamic player. When he has the puck on his stick you instantly notice him because of his high-end speed, skill and offensive IQ. He can make highly creative dekes and passes at full speed. The pace of his game is why I think he will be a top NHL player. He takes pucks up the ice and to the net often. Cooley lacks size, but he plays hard. He can drive play at even strength while also having the vision and shot to be a power-play threat running a unit from the walls. He projects as a first-line forward; as a center, he would be a low-end first-line center in the NHL.","Cooley is a beautiful, flowing skater capable of beating defenders off the mark, circling the zone to get defenders watching him with the puck, and manipulate them with his footwork and maneuverability in tight spaces. He's got an uncanny ability to side-step and hop around oncoming players at speed. He's got a great sixth sense for timing and spacing around the offensive zone which frees him to accept passes or jumps him onto rebounds. He regularly flashes skill to the inside, slicing to the middle and pulling pucks through or around defenders. He's also a Swiss Army knife player who combines NHL speed and skill with a working attitude to push the pace, make plays, win races, stay involved, and get onto the ice in all situations.

I love his tempo and feel for the game out there. His touch with the puck and hands both get high grades, his skating (particularly his change of pace) and energy level are both differentiators, and those things make for a pretty compelling package. You won't find a scout who doesn't like him, either. The transition game into the offensive zone. The vision off the wall. He can play interior or exterior. He's incredibly crafty in control. He can stickhandle in a phone booth. He creates problems for defencemen attacking on angles and shifting at speed. He also has a scrappiness to his game that keeps him in the fight.","Logan Cooley is for sure one of the more well-rounded and talented players in the entire 2022 draft class. He certainly projects as a top-6 forward, who could play anywhere in the lineup and be able to contribute without question. Based off his play to start the season, it wouldn't come as a shock to see Cooley's name come off the draft board within the first 5 picks, possibly even inside the top 3. Plenty of teams will fawn over his abilities and depending on the situation he's drafted into, that team may be able to sway his decision to forego the NCAA next season, and head straight to the NHL.","Over the last several months, I have constantly debated who was No. 1. I had Cooley at No. 1 at the mid-term and I waffled over the next few months when Wright started picking up his play. That also coincided with Cooley dipping in production and playing a more complicated game than he needed to. But the reasons I had Cooley No. 1 then are the reasons I have him there now. This is not a great draft at the top, but he's this draft's most dynamic player with the greatest potential for explosive offense. With high-end speed and the ability to make high-level plays on the rush, he does things most players in this class cannot. While he played with a brilliant supporting class at the NTDP this year – as you'll see down this list at the number of U.S. U18s in the first-round range – Cooley was always heads above the rest in terms of the plays he could create and the way he dictated shifts throughout the season. 

I believe he can be a No. 1 center at the next level if he continues on his current trend line. He competes on every inch of the ice and can play a strong north-south game despite his ability to stretch defenses with his east-west skill.

As I've watched the playoffs this year, my thinking shifted even more. The best teams have fast, dynamic forwards that are constantly keeping defenders on their heels. They don't cede possession without trying all of their other options. Cooley processes the game as fast as anyone in this draft and his ability to spot plays in transition is a major separator from the field. He has vision, threads passes well and can get behind defenders to give himself better looks at the net. Cooley is headed to the University of Minnesota next year, which has been a solid training ground the last few years for players on the NHL track. I think he's probably a one-and-done in college player and would be ready to make an NHL impact by 2023-24.

In the end it's not about when he arrives, but how he progresses. I think he has the highest ceiling of any of the top three NHL prospects and plays the style most consistent with the modern NHL's. Speed is a premium and he brings it in spades, with the ability to finish plays as well as anyone else in this class. If everything goes right for him, and that's always a big if with any player's development, I think Cooley could be a superstar in the league.","A highly creative, speed-driven pivot who brings a lot of pop down the middle. Cooley really showed his ability to activate and make plays off of the rush this season. Very exciting hands to go with the quick feet. Should be able to play a comprehensive, all-situations role in a few years. ","You won't find a more singularly-gifted puckhandler in this year's draft than Logan Cooley. He's a human highlight-reel, swashbuckling his way through defenders like a hot knife cuts through butter.
It all starts with the first touch, and Cooley has the best one in this class. The way he seamlessly blends pass recep-tions at speed into his first move without breaking stride is almost unfair. Whether it's catching a difficult pass on the backhand, forehand, or inside a crossover -- Cooley's making it happen. It's like watching a wide receiver with an unlimited catch radius.
The way Cooley keeps his top hand pushed out from his body as a handler for the full range of motion, changes speeds and lanes through the neutral zone, and deceives with shoulder feints and look-offs -- this is pro-level stuff. You can rest assured that this part of his game is going to scale up to the NHL in at least some capacity.
Cooley's more than just an AND1 Mixtape on skates, though. He's one of the rare triple-threat scorers in this draft. All of those moves serve a purpose, whether it's drawing in defenders to create space elsewhere, opening up passing lanes, or getting into better shooting positions. Think of it as controlled chaos. there -- the vision and anticipation to see developing plays, the cunning and deception to make them more easily attain-able, and the touch as a distributor to connect.
Our only real concern with Cooley's projection is the ab-sence of any high-end tools outside of his skill as a handler. Even then, Cooley's tendency to play beyond his considerable skill level often turns his greatest asset into a liability. There were just far too many turnovers and low percentage plays in his draft year for our liking.
On the one hand, you want to see a gifted player like Cooley test the limits of their game every time he takes the ice; on the other, a little discretion would go a long way.
Where Cooley managed to allay our concerns on that front was with his growth this season as an off-the-puck scoring threat. It showed our staff that there was a way for him to stay involved in his team's offence even when he's not driving play personally. The proof of concept that he can produce in a more selfless fashion.
Cooley supports the play well, consistently displays an understanding of the rotation habits of everyone on the ice, perfectly times his movements into space, and prepares his body and footwork to send one- and two-touch attempts on goal as the puck finds him.
Still, it wouldn't hurt Cooley to add another gear as a skater. He's a bit top-heavy, lacks explosive lateral mobility, and sometimes struggles to access his outside edges. He's about an NHL average skater as currently constructed, and it's definitely a part of his game that could stand to improve.
Overall, though, there's no disputing Cooley's No. 1 centre upside, even if it's hardly a foregone conclusion that he gets there at the height of his career. Just having that within his range of realistic outcomes counts for a lot.","A small, speedy center, Cooley dominated the USHL and solidified himself in my top five as the season progressed. Cooley consistently took over games using his excellent speed and instincts.

More of a playmaker than a goal-scorer, Cooley can drive a line on his own. He can run a powerplay and isn't afraid to put himself in harm's way to make a play. He is also a relentless forechecker and possession driver. Cooley plays with high tempo and energy. Not only is he a great skater, but he is also incredibly agile and uses this ability to elude defenders.  He is also excellent defensively and is rarely a liability in his own zone. Cooley makes excellent transition plays and finds ways to utilize all his teammates on a regular basis. He has shown he can drive a line and there is a dynamic quality to his game.

Cooley is a likely top-five pick and could go as high as number two. He is slated to attend the University of Minnesota next season. Cooley is likely one year away from NHL duty.","Juraj Slafkovsky drives offense from the wing. He's a massive winger who has made a strong case to challenge for first overall. He can play at a high pace and has impressive agility for someone his size.  Using strong strides with his long legs, he can generate a lot of speed with just a few steps. While he lacks that extra gear to create separation, it's how well he protects the puck when challenged that makes up for any speed or burst concerns that may follow him. With strong stickhandling and the ability to move the puck in tight, he can control possession as well as the pace of the play. On-ice awareness in all three zones is another aspect of his game where he excels, making the extra effort on backchecks as well as going down low to support his blueliners when defending. He also uses his stick very well, taking advantage of his long reach to win battles to loose pucks. He has such immense offensive potential that it can be frustrating to see him pass up great scoring opportunities for himself and teammates. Learning how to take what's given to him and remove moments of tunnel-vision from his game is something he will need to improve on to be a more consistent impact player when attacking. His unique blend of size and skill could make him a dominant player at the NHL level. He is the ultimate swing on upside while still having a solid floor. If he becomes the player he is capable of developing into, there is little doubt Slafkovsky will be a force at the NHL for the next 15 years and people will wonder why there was even a debate about the top pick in this class. If he doesn't hit his that potential, he's still got potential as a top-six scoring winger who impacts the game regularly."
2022,D,75,189,6,CBJ,5,David Jiricek,"Jiricek is a big, right-shot defenseman who makes an impact at both ends of the rink. He has great individual skill to make opponents miss. You combine that with very good vision and a hard point shot, and inside the offensive zone he can make a lot happen and be dangerous on a power play. His skating won't dazzle, but for his size he gets around well enough. What his skating looks like post-knee surgery is something to monitor. He shows some shiftiness to pull away from checks, but lacks ideal speed and burst for the NHL level. Despite that, he defends well due to his reach and a high level of physical play, often punishing opposing forwards with his body. He projects as a top-pair defenseman.","After suffering a knee injury at the world juniors, Jiricek returned in time to play with the Czechia men's national team ahead of and into men's worlds in their April and May international schedule, an important series of games which helped him reaffirm to NHL clubs that the layoff wouldn't impact him. Before the injury, he was a big part of a top team in the Tipsport Extraliga, contributing at both ends and driving possession and scoring results for the second consecutive season while playing more than 18 minutes a game.

He has some extremely desirable attributes, marked by one of — if not the — hardest point shots in the draft (it's a bomb, and he does a really good job keeping it on target and a few feet off the ice), a strong, athletic 6-foot-3 frame, and a more commanding on-ice presence than Nemec's. He's a strong and sturdy defender who plays a staunch man-to-man style, moves his feet well for his size, and thrives in transition with his ability to both close out on gaps with his length through neutral ice and lead a ton of rushes as a puck transporter. Offensively, he's also a capable handler and distributor whose point shot is complemented by an aggressive approach.

His game isn't as tactile as Nemec's, but he's more than just an athletically gifted, hard-shooting, attacking (offensively and defensively) defender. There are also some subtleties to his game (passes that are almost never off-target, a sneaky-silky first touch, etc.). But his modus operandi is that he's a confident, active, engaged three-zone player who has all of the tools you look for in a top defender. As he continues to smooth out and polish his game, it's hard to imagine he doesn't become, at the very least, a top-four guy. And if he hits the right notes along his development path, his ceiling will be very high. He's hard not to get excited about, even if I prefer Nemec's style.",Top pairing defenseman at the NHL level if he works on his positioning in the defensive zone and can continue work on acceleration when hunting for defensive recoveries.,"A highly mobile, 6-foot-3 defenseman with a bomb of a shot and solid puck-moving capabilities, Jiricek has incredible upside relative to the class. He missed the second half of the season due to a knee injury, needing more than three months to rehab. Jiricek returned in time to play for the Czech national team at the Men's World Championship, showing that he's healthy and prepared to make an impact. When he played, he played well – showcasing that tremendous mobility and the physical stature that made him look no different than the professionals he was playing with and against.

Jiricek has played professionally over each of the last two seasons, more than holding his own as a youngster in a tough Czech league. This year, he had 11 points with Plzen. It is very possible he'd be back with Plzen next season, unless the team that drafts him wants to bring him to North America to get started in the AHL. He still has a lot of development ahead of him. That said, the skill set he has shown, the well-roundedness of his game and his size profile are all reasons I have him just a hair above Nemec in this particular class. I think there's a little more ceiling for Jiricek to reach.","A knee injury fractured Jiříček's season, but it was still a formidable one. The Czechia defender plays a cerebral game with a bevy of physical tools. The skating was never a strong suit and since the injury, it's looked a little shakier. That will be item No. 1 to clean up. But if he can get that part of his game back on track, there's a legitimate top-four upside.","David Jiříček finishes the year as the highest-ranked de-fenceman for Elite Prospects after a year-long dogfight with Šimon Nemec for the distinction.
This endorsement, of course, marks something of a depar-ture from the industry consensus, but it's a position we've arrived at confidently. The more eyes our group set on Jiříček, the more we came to admire the way he plied his trade. There were even some in our ranks who were so bold as to float the possibility of Jiříček at No. 1 overall.
The book on Jiříček is a tome at this stage. He's already played two full years of professional hockey in the Czech Extraliga with HC Plzeň, and he has a wealth of international experience that would be the envy of most 10-year NHL vet-erans. We're talking about close to 10 separate appearances in his country's colours the last two seasons, including a pair of trips to the World Juniors and a tour on the Czech blue line at this year's World Hockey Championship.
And for the most part, Jiříček handled each assignment admirably. His creativity at the offensive blue line, coupled with a constant drive to push the boundaries of his skill set, made him this draft's most compelling offensive defenceman. Not content to unleash his cannon of a slap shot from the furthest recesses of the offensive zone, Jiříček sought to create advantages in the attacking third with every touch. He would use the threat of his shot to open up passing lanes or skate into space to draw in defenders before sending the puck elsewhere. With natural agility and elusiveness as a skater, some skill as a handler, and an understanding of how to leverage his 6-foot-3 frame to protect the puck, there isn't any reason we can't expect this to continue to at least some degree in the NHL.
Now, there is some room for improvement there. Jiříček doesn't settle for low percentage shots at the point, but that doesn't mean that the Czech blueliner hasn't stepped into a few attempts that go off of a defender's shinpads and escape his team's possession from time to time. His handling me-chanics have proven inconsistent this season, too.
The big question here, though, is whether an NHL coach will give Jiříček the freedom to play his sometimes freewheel-ing style. It's going to play a critical role in determining his developmental arc. Time will tell.
There needn't be any concern over whether Jiříček's going to be able to hang in a high leverage role at the NHL level, though. There's a durable defensive foundation in place that will carry him to a top-four role at a bare minimum, even if his play with the puck doesn't come along for the ride.
The 18-year-old Czech blueliner plays a tight gap through the neutral zone, deploys sound footwork defending the blue line, and contains exceptionally well in body-on-body defensive scenarios. Few players in this draft can match Jiříček as a play-stopper.
You need to be able to move the puck in the contemporary NHL, and Jiříček is up to that task, too. You'd like to see a little more scanning pre-touch on defensive zone retrievals, and maybe a little more patience with the puck sometimes, but we still view his transition game as an NHL-level part of his profile.
In Jiříček you're looking at a 6-foot-3, right-shot defenceman who can do just about everything at a low-end top-pairing level through the height of his career, and that's a hell of a return on one's investment at the top of the draft.","Similar to Nemec, Jiricek plays a mature game for his age. While Nemec is a better skater, Jiricek plays a more complete physical game. Jiricek is a hard-hitter and loves to engage physically. His defensive game is his calling card, and he uses his frame well to break up plays.

He also has a tremendously hard shot, perhaps the hardest slap shot of any defenseman in this draft. Jiricek is an asset in all three zones, whether with or without the puck, making him a coveted player in the draft. He also excelled playing against men in the Czech Republic's top league.  He doesn't bend under pressure and makes excellent puck decisions.  

A serious knee injury derailed much of his season, but he has appeared to make a full recovery. Jiricek has some raw tools, plays with high pace, and is physically mature. His overall game needs to be more consistent, but that will come with time and maturity. He is likely two years away from full-time NHL duty and projects as a top-four defenseman at the NHL level.","David Jiricek is an exceptional two-way defenseman who really helps drive the transition play with his mobility and his puck skills. He possesses a ton of patience and poise with the puck on his stick, using his head to scan the play, oftentimes looking like a veteran well above his age. He rarely rushes a decision with the puck, scanning all possible options before delivering a pass. His passing is one of his best attributes, making strong outlet dishes from the defensive zone to push the play up ice. There is not a pass on the ice that he doesn't feel he can't make, which makes it even more impressive that he rarely forces a low percentage pass that'll result in a turnover. His size and high-end skating make him a force at the defensive end of the ice. His ability to defend the rush is top-notch, using his body and stick to maintain solid gap control and easily steer oncoming attackers away from the center lane and completely negating their offensive momentum. Like any young player, there is some mental errors in his game that will start to disappear as he gets older and gains more playing experience and maturity. There are some mistimed pinches at times, leaving him having to race back to catch the play after getting burnt. On occasion, he tries to add some creativity in his game, from a little stutter-step at the blue line to a squeeze down the boards. This tends to end up in a turnover, so he should try to keep his game a little simpler. He projects as a top-pairing defenseman who will be heavily relied on to play in all situations in the NHL. Jiricek has the physical gifts and the skillset to make a massive impact from the back end. It would not be a surprise if he is the first defenseman taken in the NHL Draft."
2022,C,69,175,9,BUF,6,Matthew Savoie,"Savoie is a very talented scorer. He stands out with the puck on his stick and can attack in a variety of ways. Savoie is an excellent passer, who can run a power play, hit seams at a high rate and make tough plays under duress. He has very good hands to maneuver in traffic. He has good speed to beat opponents wide and he has a shot that can score from range. Savoie lacks ideal NHL size, but he competes hard and wins a surprising amount of battles for his size. He doesn't have incredible speed and skill for a 5-foot-9 player so he may be moved to the wing in the NHL, but regardless I see him as a very good top-six forward.","There isn't a player in this draft class whose game thrills more than Savoie's does when he's firing. Inside the offensive zone, he's lethal. He's got extremely quick side-to-side hands that help him beat defenders one-on-one off of cuts. He's got an NHL shot (which he can place with pinpoint accuracy from a bad angle and rip by a goalie clean from a distance, but he also loves to change up and slide five-hole). He does an excellent job creating plays to the slot out of traffic. He's a burning skater with explosiveness that allows him to win races, separate in transition, and put defenders onto their heels, or dash through holes in coverage to the net (or draw a penalty). He's a soft small-area passer who blends deception into his movements.

And then on top of those things, he's got a bit of a chip on his shoulder. He's always engaged, he keeps his feet moving, he plays with a ton of energy, and he finishes all of his checks and knocks his fair share of players over despite being on the smaller side). He's also sturdier on his feet than his frame might suggest, which helps him play between checks. I see a dynamic, high-tempo, top-six, goal-creating package. He's an exciting talent in a draft that's short on them, with clear PP1 upside due to his shooting-skill package and clear five-on-five upside because of his skating and motor. Even in games where the points don't fall, he's almost always dangerous and threatening on the ice — and he's seldom going to leave you wanting more. After suffering a shoulder injury in the playoffs, Savoie is also now out of his sling, which is positive news for the summer ahead.","Matthew Savoie has star potential at the NHL level, especially if he can continue on the developmental track that he is currently on. I've talked about deceptiveness and Savoie's ability to manipulate defenses, and that will lead him to NHL success. Savoie has the potential to dazzle audiences on a nightly basis with his outstanding hockey sense, pace, and puck handling skills. Savoie could easily put up 50 assists in a season on a regular basis in his prime given how well he sees the ice and how easily he can find teammates with his passes. I'd argue that 70+ point seasons are well within the realm of possibility for Savoie if he can continue along this path. 

After watching Savoie closely for a while now, I feel that it's safe to say that he has a high probability of NHL success. Savoie will be able to keep pace on any line and slow down or speed up his game to adjust to the play style of his linemates. His timing on passes and positioning makes him one of the stronger offensive players in this draft class and a potent scorer and playmaker whenever he's on the ice. 

Some of my biggest questions with Savoie's game involve how he'll adjust to the NHL. Savoie hasn't faced the strongest competition at times this season, and I feel that he can be a little inconsistent against the better WHL teams. Typically, those are the teams that give him less space to work with, so I'm curious to see how Savoie is able to adapt. He won't be given a lot of time or space to work with in the NHL, so he'll have to rely on his quick decision making and hockey sense in order to create high danger chances. 

Another question I have is whether or not Savoie can take his game from great to elite. There's no argument in my mind that Savoie has looked great for the vast majority of the season. I've seen flashes of elite play, but not on a consistent enough basis for me to believe that he could be a top ten, maybe even top five, center in the NHL. Right now, Savoie is playing like a potential top ten pick with the potential to put up 50, perhaps even 60 points at the NHL level. I've seen a much higher gear to his game where he looks flat out dominant and a player capable of becoming a 70, even 80-point player at the NHL level. That's when he looks like a true second overall pick that could contend for the first overall spot. Right now, however, I'm waiting on Savoie to play at an elite level consistently.

Obviously, teams will worry about Savoie's size and average defensive play. I don't see it as an issue moving forward. Savoie is a deceptive skater and can avoid physical contact in all three zones, and his defensive play isn't bad for a player his size. A player's size doesn't determine a player's skill level, so passing on Savoie would be a huge mistake. Teams passing on a potential franchise cornerstone would be a bold strategy, and not one I'd recommend. Top centers, especially right handed ones, don't come around every day. 

At the end of the day, it's going to come down to how Savoie is developed and how he handles the transition to the pros. I believe that he can play in the NHL as early as next season given his dynamic nature in the offensive zone and adequate defensive zone play. Savoie should be able to thrive in the modern NHL thanks to his speed and creativity.

The Inaugural and totally real Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson “Most Electrifying Player” Award goes to Matthew Savoie for his exciting play. Savoie's game is all about drive, it's about power. He stays hungry and he devours the competition. I'm not sure about Samoan in his veins, but I do know this: he's a damn good prospect and someone I'd be clamoring to draft if I were a team with a lottery pick.","A top-10 scorer in the WHL this season, Savoie did nothing to dissuade anyone on his offensive talent. If there's one thing I thought was even better this season for Savoie, it's that he just battles. He didn't play like a 5-foot-9 player. There's an aggressiveness and a desire to physically engage with the opposition. He's going to have to get stronger to be more effective at that, but most of his other tools are high end. He's a good skater with quick hands and an ability to drive the net. His ability to distribute pucks quickly, accurately and decisively makes him stand out in the playmaking department. The size is a factor in terms of if he can play center at the top level or not and that may ultimately skew his projection, but it's hard to ignore the total skills he has. It's also hard to argue with 90 points in 65 games. This is a very competitive range of the draft, which is why it's tougher to project Savoie against some of the others.","A point-producing machine in the WHL this past season, Savoie leans on his skating, deft passing skills, and offensive mind. His reliance on the man-advantage was well documented, but he did lead all WHL 2022-eligible skaters in primary, even-strength points-per-game. The inability to get the inside, coupled with his stature and just average IQ is what keeps him a bit lower than his pure skill and stats would indicate.","Few players in the 2022 NHL Draft have spent more time in the scouting community's sights than Winnipeg Ice winger Matthew Savoie.
A rejected bid for exceptional status, the first overall pick in the WHL Draft, a trip to the USHL during the pandemic year, and back to a 90-point season with the WHL's best regular season side... he's done his part to command their attention.
Savoie's game is one of pure, unrelenting skill. He's built to score, whether that's depositing the puck in the back of the net himself or setting his teammate up for the honour. The result of this skill last season was a 1.38 point per game clip, good for the highest rate among first-time draft-eligible skaters in the WHL.
All of his scoring tools rate as above-average, but the foun-dation on which his game rests is his skating stride. Heavy crossover use and constant motion propel his high-pace, constantly attacking approach, making his every puck touch an opportunity to create a scoring chance.
Then Savoie stacks a brilliant first touch, handling skill, an in-stride wrister, and one- and two-touch passing ability on top of that skating and pace combo to ensure many of those chances aren't for naught. Having the runway to take advantage of those tools helps, but Savoie's proven a pretty robust off-puck scoring threat during sustained offensive zone sequences, too. His willing-ness to get inside and play between checks allows him to seek out soft ice, and his finishing skill takes over from there. Of course, if one were to nitpick, they would point out that it took until about the midway point in the season for Savoie to consistently display any of these tools in a meaningful fashion. Even then, this year's tape represented a bit of a letdown relative to the lofty standards his draft-minus-one film with the USHL's Dubuque Fighting Saints established. Look through his game reports, and you'll find that he went from a can't-miss top-five player to one barely clinging to the back end of our top-10.
And of all the alarming trends to reveal themselves from Savoie's draft year, his deference was probably the one that most concerned our staff. He was, frankly, gun shy at times, it seemed. He would often panic under pressure where others would attract opponents to create space elsewhere. Simply put: Savoie didn't create advantages for his team the way that a prospect with top-line NHL aspirations should at this stage in their development.
However, the tools remain exceptional, and we saw enough flashes of high-level thinking to still feel confident with Savoie in the back half of the top 10 in this year's draft. To see him halve that number with his actual draft position wouldn't surprise us either. It's just that we've come to see him as more of a top-six prospect than a top-line one, and the result is his No. 10 billing in the Elite Prospects 2022 NHL Draft Guide.","I've been high on Savoie all season and my impressions of him have not changed. A small, diminutive center, Savoie is a well-rounded offensive-minded player. He plays with high pace and tenacity as well, making him a formidable opponent.

Last season, Savoie dominated the USHL, and this season, he put up 90 points in the WHL, showing an ability to put up points at high levels of competition. Savoie has a reputation for anticipating the play well and making plays at top speed with ease. Savoie uses his edges well in-tight. He projects more as a playmaker at the NHL level and can be used in all offensive situations. He appears to have the ability to drive a line and make those around him better.

Savoie's biggest question mark is his size. There are few NHL centers below 5'11. However, his skill and speed significantly make up for his lack of height. He is also strong on his skates and has excellent balance. His speed and hockey sense can get him out of sticky situations quickly. His offensive versatility also means he could potentially play the wing, though most teams that draft him would likely prefer him to be a center.

Savoie will likely need another season or two of seasoning and strength building to be NHL-ready. He projects as a top-six forward at the NHL level.","Matthew Savoie is an extremely intelligent playmaking forward who plays the game at a very high pace and was a very effective player in all situations this year, whether it was five-on-five, the power play, or even the penalty kill. He has the ability to play the game effectively at whatever pace is dictated. If the game is wide open, he's able to use his explosiveness to blow by blueliners the second they make a mistake trying to defend him, and if the game is more controlled he has a firm grasp on his defensive assignments and won't lose his positioning. Some players are able to move quickly when they have the puck but their hands aren't able to keep up. That's not the case with him. He's able to handle the puck extremely well at full speed and can make defenders look silly when he's one-on-one. He was lethal this year on the power play, and he's so deceptive when he has the puck he keeps opponents guessing what he's going to do. He displays a high compete-level, he's a hound on the forecheck and despite his size is not afraid of any puck battle. His defensive game also doesn't get enough credit. He's got good defensive positioning and shows good heart while killing penalties. He also has the ability to use his high hockey IQ to read the play and cause turnovers. The big knock on him really comes down to his size. He can sometimes get bottled up when he's going on a rush and get pushed off the puck, and although he is a hound on the puck he can't really use his body to separate anyone from the puck. Despite the physical limitations, a team will undoubtedly select Savoie early in the draft with the hopes he's able to develop into a top-six playmaking center."
2022,RW,69.5,185,17,NSH,7,Joakim Kemell,"Kemell is a well-rounded winger who has almost every NHL attribute you want other than the size at 5-foot-11. He brings skill and speed to his shifts, showing the ability to carry the puck up ice and create chances for himself and his teammates. Kemell can pass the puck very well, but his shot is his main weapon. You can set him up from mid-range and he can finish. He lacks size, but he plays hard, showing no fear of engaging physically to win back pucks or to take a hit to make a play. He projects as a very good top-six winger who will score a lot of goals in the NHL.","After exploding out of the gate to lead Liiga in scoring through the first third of the season, Kemell's production hit a bit of a wall in the second half with JYP, a bottom-0f-the-table team. Some of that had to do with poor puck luck (his shot generation remained high), some of it was a reduction in his ice time, and some of it was just the reality that he wasn't going to be a point-per-game producer in his draft year. He helped assuage some doubts with a six-goal, eight-point U18 worlds performance (though I thought he came and went in the middle of group play, he was excellent in the medal round).

Kemell remains one of the more gifted individual creators in this draft class. He's a slick, play-creating winger who excels in possession, carves teams up through coverage to take the play from the flanks to the interior, and possesses quick, light hands. Those tools enable him to take advantage of his dangerous wrister, which he can get off quickly from a variety of stances and at a variety of tempos.

On the puck, he's agile through cuts and changes of direction and plays an intentional, attacking style. Off of the puck, he also plays with a lot of energy and doesn't shy away from the physical side of the game, which has endeared him to coaches despite his 5-foot-11 frame. I'd like to see him slow down and utilize his linemates a little better than he does as he's actually a heady playmaker, but part of what makes him so exciting is his insistence on creating his own looks (even if that comes with some forcing it) with that shot of his. He really can sling it, with a wrister and one-timer that both pop.","Second line winger, who can be a threat on a NHL power-play.","A high-scoring winger who put up impressive numbers over the first half of the season before being slowed by injuries in the second half, Kemell has a lot of the tools you're looking for in a top-six winger. He has one of the best overall shots among the top tier of this draft class and has higher-end puck skills that allow him to beat defenders 1-on-1 and create better scoring opportunities for himself. At the U18 Worlds, he took over games at times in leading Finland to a bronze medal. He's defensively responsible for his position and never quits on pucks. His skating is pretty good as he's shown some ability to separate, but I don't think he's a natural burner. He's best in the offensive half of the ice and can be a high-end scorer at the next level with a top-six ceiling. If everything goes right, you could make a case that he has top-line scorer potential.","A high-end finisher with a top-notch one-timer, Kemell was filling the Liiga nets early, but an injury threw a wrench in things and he never refound his shine. He's going to need to simplify things and find chemistry with a space maker and distributor to max out.","Nothing about Joakim Kemell's profile coming into the season really screamed top-five pick, but that's exactly where he found himself on most public boards by December. A hot start to the scouting season at the Hlinka-Gretzky Cup and a productive first few months with JYP Jyvaskyla in Liiga play will do that for a player.
By the time Team Finland called on him for the World Juniors, Kemell had amassed 18 points in 23 games, good for a 0.78 point-per-game clip -- the fourth-highest scoring rate among first-time draft-eligible Liiga skaters in the last 20 years over a full season.
The shoulder injury that the 5-foot-11 winger sustained in the weeks leading up to the World Juniors eventually caught up with him, though, and the production started to suffer as a result. It took Kemell 10 games to find the scoresheet upon rejoining JYP in January, and he only managed six points total in the final 16 games of the season.
Neither segment of Kemell's season is especially indicative of the player's quality, though. He wasn't quite as exceptional as his gaudy point totals might've suggested through the first few months of the season and nowhere near as inept as his muted point totals in the back nine of the season would have his detractors believe.
However boring this may sound, Kemell's true talent level probably lies somewhere between those two blocks of his season. You can even see as much reflected in the statistics. There were signs in the underlying data that Elite Prospects DIr. of European Scouting Lassi Alanen tracked that the JYP winger benefited from percentage inflated totals, but you would also expect someone with so potent a shot and soft hands to outperform their expected shooting percentage. Eventually, regression occurred, and we were left with a clearer picture of the player in question.
Now, about that shot. It's easily one of the best in the class. There are only four players in our database of hundreds for this year's draft with a 7-grade as a shooter, and Kemell is one of them.
He's one of a select few players who can credibly threaten as a shooter from intermediate-to-long range consistently. Kemell is most comfortable firing the outside-leg wrister, pushing his hands in front of his body, generating the desired downforce, shifting his weight appropriately, and snapping the puck on goal. that our partners at InStat had him down for starts to make a whole lot of sense when you see the way he slings the puck out there.
It's not enough to just have shooting skills, though. The game's best goal scorers all find ways to stack the odds in their favour with crafty off-puck movement. And Kemell gets it. He anticipates pockets of space well, arrives as the puck does for shooting op-portunities, positions his body in the best way to catch and release each pass, and generally seems well-connected to his teammates during sustained offensive zone possessions. He's always involved in the play.
You'll never mistake Kemell for a retrieval artist either, but he's shown some forechecking skill and physicality across many of our viewings, too. He doesn't need someone else to do the dirty work to make things happen. And as someone with an above-average skating stride, hands, and puck protection mechanics -- Kemell can make something happen every time he secures possession.
The problem with Kemell, of course, is that he's often a little too aware of his handling and shooting ability. His skills are closer to average than high-end, but he sometimes plays with the confidence of Connor McDavid anyway. The result is a lot of low percentage shots, turnovers, and missed passing opportunities. He can be downright infuriating to watch at times, more so than just about any other player in the top half of our first round.
Unlocking the best in Kemell at the next level should be a pretty straightforward exercise, and there's a nice package of skills there to work with. Add a gear to his skating stride, introduce more manipulative patterns in his small-area game, and you're looking at a low-end top-six shoot-first forward. If nothing else, a long and fruitful career as a middle-six power play specialist is likely in the cards.","Kemell burst onto the scene this season in Finland, scoring at a torrid pace and looking to smash some records in the country's top league for teenagers. However, his game cooled off significantly in the second half of the season and he struggled at times to create offense. Regardless, 15 goals for a draft-eligible player competing against men is no small feat.  

Goal-scoring is clearly Kemell's greatest strength. He has an excellent wrist shot and loves to set up for one-timers on the powerplay.  Kemell is a volume shooter and finds ways to get to open ice to create scoring opportunities with ease. He doesn't have high top speed, but he has an excellent first step which gives him time and space in the offensive zone.

Kemell will need to work on his overall consistency and will likely need at least two years of extra development before being NHL-ready.  He projects as a top-six winger at the NHL level.","Joakim Kemell is a talented forward who shot up draft boards to his incredible hot streak to start the season. The first thing is evidently clear about his game is his stellar puck skills. His hands set him up for success and has even seen him embarrass professional competition at select moments. Additionally, he possesses what most would argue is a top-5 shot in the draft class. He is also a fine skater. He can generate speed quickly, which allows him to be effective at transitioning from defense to offense. Even better, his forechecking is always a quality trait due to his stellar acceleration and strong edges. These tools also help in the defensive zone, allowing him to close in on opposing defensemen quickly, pressuring them into mistakes. In the defensive zone, his positioning is fairly adequate but his inactive stick in these instances does allow for plays to be made at the blue line. The other concern for him is how effective his offense is outside of his sniping ability. He is sometimes seem primarily as a perimeter player who benefited from his strong shot and some lucky bounces to inflate his scoring. He's not particularly strong, either, so driving towards the net is not something he does at a frequent enough pace. However, a lack of strength should be expected for a draft-eligible playing in a top professional European league. Given time and the right program, this is an element that shouldn't have long-term concern, and his strong skating and elite shot make a solid prospect worthy of his draft position. Kemell could, too, outperform that draft slot should he develop a more well-rounded offensive attack to compliment his shot and stay as an average defensive talent."
2022,RW,71,165,15,VAN,8,Jonathan Lekkerimaki,"Lekkerimaki is a skilled winger who has various offensive elements in his game, but the clear strength of his game is his shot. He is a goal-scoring threat from the faceoff dots with a hard, accurate wrist shot and one-timer that projects to be a weapon in the NHL. He has good speed, hands and vision to generate clean entries and make plays but those aspects don't pop like his shot. Like a lot of shooters, he leans too much on his best asset and play too much on the perimeter which isn't ideal for a player who lacks size. Lekkerimaki projects as a quality top-six winger.","Lekkerimaki had quite the draft year, with some beautiful goals in arguably the third-best pro league in the world, a Globe Trotters feel at the J20 level with linemates Liam Ohgren and Noah Ostlund (who will both also be first rounders), and a brilliant 15-point performance at U18 worlds. This included four in Sweden's stunning gold medal win over the Americans. He's got one of the quickest catch-and-release motions in the draft. He's dynamic in control and threatening from anywhere in the offensive zone. He can beat you in an instant or hang onto pucks and make things happen himself. He's got a knack for hitting holes in the net, frequently beating goalies low-blocker and five-hole. He's got A-level hands, a deceptive release, and a slyness to his game that allows him to get to spots to score with and without the puck. With the right development and patience, he's got clear upside as a top-six creator and finisher. His game can drift to the perimeter at times, but he's got the skill to play that way. You want the puck in his hands. Mix in a late-July birthday, his rapid progression, and an ability to put the puck in the net with consistency from mid range and he's one of the draft's top forwards.","Given Lekkerimaki's ability to find open ice in the slot and in the neutral zone to key up passing lanes, he constantly puts himself in the position to succeed offensively. His shot off the rush and shot in a standstill position allows him to capitalize when he has the puck on his stick. There is a lot to like about Lekkerimaki's offensive game and the fact that he can use utilize quality stick-handling to get out of sticky situations only increases his value.

From a defensive perspective, there are areas that he needs to work on especially with upper body strength to increase his reach and fend off bigger competitors. But, he has the speed to get to loose pucks before his competitors do even in situations where he doesn't seem to have the upper hand. All-in-all, I feel confident that the NHL team who drafts Lekkerimaki is netting a top six forward, who will be defensively responsible and at the same time generate top six point totals.

After publishing this report, I had been asked by a few people on whether or not I would potentially line Lekkerimaki at center at the next level. I get why teams would try to experiment with him at center, but I have a few issues that I think would prevent him from being a center. His reach. Until he can acquire quality off-puck reach, he will face challenges defending in the slot. Same issue behind the red line. Also, I don't think his playmaking ability is consistent enough in which I'd feel entirely comfortable with him at center at the NHL level. If he can grow into his size and be a bit more consistent with his playmaking, you could potentially put him at center. But, until we see Lekkerimaki address what I had mentioned above, I would leave him at wing. ","An offensive dynamo, Lekkerimaki scored at every level he was at this year with 20 goals in 26 games at the U20 level in Sweden, plus another seven goals at the top pro level, not to mention 15 points to lead all players at the U18 World Championship this spring. Lekkerimaki is an advanced offensive performer with a top-tier shot that is both quick and stunningly accurate. He started scoring at the Hlinka-Gretzky Cup last summer and just didn't stop until he missed the last month of the season with what was believed to be mono. He returned to health in time for U18s and led Sweden to its second ever gold medal at that event, beating a U.S. team that was dominant to that point in the tournament. His 15 points led all players. He is a competitor who can make all sorts of plays and looks like a guy who has a great chance to be a top-six forward at the next level.",Lekkerimaki owns one of the best releases in the class and needs a whisper of time to get it off. He split his time between the J20 and SHL and was given offensive opportunities in the top tier. A monstrous offensive showing at the U18s has catapulted him up draft boards. He'll need to prove capable of getting inside at the next level.,"The defining characteristic of Jonathan Lekkerimaki's game is his shot. It's one of the best in the class, second only to Jagger Firkus in this year's Elite Prospects scout's poll.
Our Swedish regional scout Jimmy Hamrin was even so bold as to liken Lekkerimaki's release to Alexander Holtz's from the 2020 NHL Draft. That's not praise that we would apportion lightly and without due consideration either, especially for a player that we're slightly lower on than most in the public and private spheres. So you can take us at our word on this one.
The catch-and-release, one-timer, wrist shot, snapshot, slap shot -- Lekkerimaki has the tool for any occasion, and they're all already high-end-to-elite even by the NHL's standards. It's such an advanced tool that it doesn't even merit a mechanical breakdown. It's not like words could even do it justice. You watch him shoot the puck, and it's self-evidently perfect.
Where Lekkerimaki often left our staff wanting, though, was in the way that he set up his shot. At least early in the season. There wasn't any display of off-puck instincts or timing, and he'd often staple himself to the perimeter during offensive zone play. It was more of a wasted gift than anything. As the season progressed, though, Lekkerimaki started to show advanced instincts as a scorer. He started to hide in defenders' blindspots and drive the net off-puck for soft ice or rebound opportunities. Suddenly, there was a little cunning to match the brute force of his release. He looked like a projectable scorer.
That shot may be the best of Lekkerimaki's offensive tools, but it's not the only one. He's also a reasonably deft handler, with the skill to blend pass receptions into dangles, deceptive manoeuvring, and a sound mechanical base with the puck almost always handled in his hip pocket.
""He handles with the very end of the heel of his blade, with the front part of it slightly raised, which reduces the radius of his forehand, backhand motions and helps rapidly shuffle the puck,"" Elite Prospects lead scout  wrote in a mid-season Scout's Notebook. ""This technique coupled with his above-average reaction time allows him to dangle through the stick and skates of defenders and to release the puck in an instant.""
It's a tool that Lekkerimaki would often rely on as his only means of gaining the inside of the offensive zone, but we've noticed a bit more discretion on this file from the Djurgårdens product as the season has progressed.
Still, our admiration for the 5-foot-11 winger is tempered by a whole host of concerns about his ability to process the game at an NHL level.
Even Lekkerimaki's improvements off-puck haven't elevated this part of his game to an average projection; he still misses plays or mistimes his arrival to shooting opportunities. We haven't seen him display a consistent ability to handle physicality either, and his battle level hasn't exactly drawn rave reviews. He still relies far too much on his hands between the blue lines, using them as his only tool to gain the zone. There's a lot of work that has to be done here.
Sometimes you bet on immense physical gifts and hope that the rest of a player's game rounds into form in the hands of an NHL development staff. That's the gambit with Lekkerimaki, and it makes him one of the higher upside plays in the entire draft. There's also a lot of risk there, and we had to hedge a bit with our ranking.
If everything breaks right, Lekkerimaki has 30-plus-goal upside at the NHL level. Perhaps even better than that. So it won't surprise us when a team takes him a fair bit higher than where we've ranked Lekkerimaki.","Lekkerimaki is a fun prospect, and he draws many comparisons to Kemell's game. Also a goal-scorer, Lekkerimaki excels at finding and creating space for himself to get off a quick shot.  He is an excellent skater that uses his edges well. He loves to shoot off the rush and scores with ease.  Lekkerimaki has excellent puck skills and can drive play.  He is a constant scoring threat in all situations.

Lekkerimaki's biggest area of improvement is rounding out his offensive game.  There is no question he already has an NHL-ready shot.  However, sometimes he shoots too quickly from the perimeter.  Driving the net more and attempting to create offense from tougher areas in-tight could go a long way in developing his game.  He will need some time to develop his overall game.  He projects as a top-six goal-scorer at the NHL level and is likely 2-3 years away from NHL duty.","Jonathan Lekkerimaki is one of the top wingers in the NHL Draft, and one who uses his elite shot and top-notch offensive instincts to be a force on the ice. He is a sniper through and through, make no mistake. He has a quick release and powerful shot that has the potential to score from almost any spot in the offensive zone. In order to allow himself the chance to show off that shot, he is smart and knows how to position himself in the way of opposing defenders in order to protect the puck. He is also a pretty strong skater who can hit a solid top speed. He is just an overall dynamo when on the power play, too. His primary option is to shoot, but his passing and ability to carry the puck towards the net are also super solid and allows him to be a bit more multi-dimensional. He has great agility and mobility, which affords him these chances to score on the rush or drive toward the net. On the defensive side of things, he is less thrilling. He can use his strong skating to be a large forechecking threat. Otherwise, he will need to continue maturing as a defender. As a smaller winger, he should not be expected to carry a massive load defensively, but his sense of open opposing skaters and stick positioning still needs to develop further, which should be expected just given time and more experience playing on the senior circuit as much as he did. His goal-scoring habits translated on professional level already, which is a positive sign, and he used it to exploit competition when at the junior level.  Lekkerimaki has all the potential to be a contributor in a team's top-six and first unit power play, and his value to a team at the NHL Draft is that of a player who makes an impact when he crosses over the offensive blue line."
2022,C,70,180,13,CHI,9,Frank Nazar,"Nazar brings a lot of speed and energy to his shifts. He lacks ideal NHL size, but he makes up for it with his effort. He is hard on pucks, and shows no fear in how he attacks the interior third of the offensive zone. He can make an occasional flashy deke or pass, but most of his offense comes from the high percentage areas. Nazar's great speed helps him get to the net and turn around a lot of defenders. He projects as a third-line center with a chance to be a No. 2 center.","Few dash around the ice and make plays in this draft like Nazar does. Nazar turned me into a big fan last season and he has continued to add layers to his game. He's a threatening player from the hashmarks because of his wrister, which he pops off of his stick with power and precision thanks in large part to the balance he displays through his weight shift (he's not a particularly strong kid). He's got quick hands, which help him deftly adjust in traffic to get shots off under pressure.

He flashes creativity throughout his game. He plays pucks into space as well as anyone in the draft, regularly executing through tight gaps in coverage. And he's just a hungry, driven player who consistently targets the middle lane with his greatest asset: his skating. Nazar's one of the fastest players in the draft, not only in straight lines and winding up through his crossovers, but also adjusting tempos (a learned skill that he really developed at U.S. NTDP). This allows him to impact play both with the puck attacking in transition to turn defenders or creating breakaways, as well as without it, speeding into lanes to get open for his linemates.

He also consistently supports the play high in the offensive zone without possession when that's his role. He can be careless with the puck and try to do too much at times but he's also capable of going right into coverage to make something happen. He's still got some work to do to add muscle, but he's an extremely gifted athlete who moves and does things on the ice that few can.","Simply put, Nazar is the style of player you would love to have on your team but would be a huge thorn in your side to play against. He can beat you offensively using his very talented skating ability and incredible playmaking skills, and he can beat you defensively by using his impressive hand-eye coordination and relentless effort to disrupt any sort of offense your team looks to create.
Nazar's game has steadily improved over the past few seasons as he's developed through the ranks of the NDTP. However, in 2021-22, he's shot up several scout's draft lists, even challenging teammate Logan Cooley in some rankings to be the first NDTP off the board at the 2022 Draft. It's obviously far too early to tell at this point, but as both players are enjoying amazing seasons as we reach the midpoint of the season, it's only going to get more and more interesting. At this moment, look for Frank Nazar to come off the board anywhere from pick 7-15.","One of the most exciting and entertaining players in this draft, Nazar has quick feet and quick hands. Despite not being the biggest guy, he is an effective center who can make plays all over the ice. He makes everyone around him better and makes opposing defenses look foolish on a regular basis. Nazar's anticipation is off the charts and he processes the game at a speed that matches his hands and feet. If he were bigger, we'd be talking about him as a top-three potential player in this draft. But he does have a lot of strength he's going to need to add to be an effective player at the next level. It's hard for 5-foot-9 centers to get drafted in the top 10, but I think a reason Nazar has a chance is he's competitive on all pucks and uses every ounce of the strength he has to compete for pucks in all areas of the ice. The NTDP forwards are all especially defensively responsible and Nazar is no exception. I think he has star potential if everything goes right for him these next few years at Michigan.","The best speed and skill combination in the class, Nazar lives on the inside despite being a touch undersized. He added a more technical passing game and two-way acumen to his arsenal this past season. The Michigan commit needs to prove capable of translating his game up, but if he can, he's got first-line goods.","Frank Nazar III is the force multiplier in the 2022 NHL Draft. It's as if his team has a numbers advantage almost every time he steps on the ice.
You watch Nazar cut through the neutral zone with speed and manoeuvre his way through defenders like they aren't even there, and our label of him as a force multiplier doesn't warrant further inquiry. It's obvious, plain for all to see.
A lot of the time, though, Nazar makes subtle, almost im-perceptible plays at every corner of the ice to create advan-tages for his linemates – little things like dragging defenders toward him on entries to create half-ice 2-on-1s or driving the net off-the-puck to give his linemate more runway. The more attention you pay to Nazar, the more you appreciate his offensive genius.
An inside-driven dual-threat scorer, Nazar isn't shy about using his plus-level skill as a handler to get between the hashmarks. It's his default setting if anything. A smooth, precise puckhandler who maintains possession at the heel of his blade, hands moving independently of his feet – this part of his game comfortably projects to the NHL, too.
The question, and it's a fair one, is whether Nazar's 5-foot-10 frame will be able to sustain this playing style in a American pivot's projection? And is he still a centre?
Our ranking of Nazar should make clear that we're not especially concerned. The inside of the offensive zone won't be as easily accessible at the next level, even for all his skill as a handler, but there's so much more to his game than that, even if that's one of his more admirable qualities.
We've already touched on his guile as a distributor, but you can also count on Nazar to consistently create shooting opportunities for himself with his off-puck intelligence. He's a master of the give-and-go, timing contact against defenders to create space, hiding in defender's blindspots -- you name it. And he's never going to be late to a shooting opportunity either. Nazar is one of the draft's most effortless skaters, with nearly perfect mechanical form and small-area agility to match. 
The skill, the sense... it's all there for Nazar, and his ceil-ing is among the highest in this draft as a result. And if he stood but a few inches taller, we suspect more of our peers would hold him in a similar esteem.
There's no guarantee that Nazar will one day leverage these tools at the NHL level well enough to be a first-line centre. Much like Cooley, though, it's well within his range of possible outcomes. If you want to swing for the fences in this part of the draft, then he's your guy.","Scouts are all over the place when evaluating Nazar.  I've seen him as high as three on some lists and as low as the high 20's.  Personally, I'm really high on Nazar for two reasons: His elite skating and his drive with the puck.

Nazar is a relentless skater and forechecker.  He never stops moving.  He plays with high energy and pace and loves to accelerate with the puck on his stick.  Versatility is a strong suit for Nazar as well.  He has played both the wing and center over the past year and excelled playing in all situations. Nazar also has an excellent shot and loves to rip it from far off.  Overall, he is a player you would love to have on your team based on his combination of speed, puck pursuit, creativity, and skill.

Some scouts question his overall offensive ceiling.  At worst he projects as a middle-six forward and at best a top-six forward. Nazar will have the opportunity to play for Michigan next season.  He is likely 2-3 years away from NHL duty.","Frank Nazar is a versatile forward who has potential as a dynamic, offensive winger with a knack for setting up his teammates in prime shooting locations. He has excellent patience with the puck on his stick, and because of his playmaking instincts he always seems to know where his teammates are on the ice. He's a strong skater with long, powerful strides, allowing him to push the pace of play as he carries the puck up and down the ice. He combines his high-end skating ability with quick hands and good puck control, allowing him to be a deadly creator when attacking off the rush. He has the ability to take defenders out wide and bait them into overcommitting before he quickly changes pace and leaves them in the dust. Defensively, there are some inconsistencies in his game. At times he shows a strong sense of positional discipline and high-effort making him a strong defensive player, but at other times he leaves a lot to be desired. He can get caught puck-watching too, forcing him to wander out of position or into his teammates area and leaving his assignment wide open for a pass. He seems to have a split opinion of him amongst some people in the draft community, but there is a lot to like about a player with his skillset. The next steps for him are to become more reliant on his own skillset and become a more consistent play driver rather than deferring to his teammates, which he does too frequently. With his skillset, he can develop into an effective two-way winger with the potential to be a play driving winger and slot in anywhere in a team's top-nine. Nazar's skillset and ability to play anywhere in a team's lineup should make him very appealing to NHL teams looking to add skill to their lineup."
2022,LW,74.5,200,5,PHI,10,Cutter Gauthier,"Gauthier has the tools that can make you easily envision him in the NHL. He has a thick 6-foot-2 frame and can skate like an NHL player. With his size and speed he can overpower opponents to force turnovers or in how he attacks the net and it makes him an asset on the PK. Gauthier can create with his skating and skill, but his main offensive weapon is his shot. He can pick corners from distance with a powerful wrist shot. I didn't love his playmaking early on but that part of his game grew on me as the season went on especially how he made passes on the move. I see a potential very good top-six forward whether at center or the wing with a chance to pop and become a true top-of-the-lineup type.","As the season progressed, Gauthier's athletic build and pro-built game pushed him from projected first-rounder to top-10 consideration for some teams. And while I'm not quite there, the appeal is obvious. Gauthier has always been a net-focussed shooter but he has worked to turn himself into a net-driven one, playing a more intentional game that knows what it is. On the puck, he uses inside body positioning to get to the middle off the cycle or the rush. Off of it, he finishes his checks and looks to help his line get it back. I wouldn't say he's a menacing power forward type, but he has learned to play a very engaged, imposing, speed game. Gauthier's a decently-smooth skater and despite his heavy skew toward shooting and goals, I find he sees the ice well, hits seams when they're there, and makes a lot of short little plays as a passer off the wall (including off his backhand).

His greatest strength is his catch-and-release. He can sling it. I do think he shoots a bit too much (a lot of his shots miss the net or are taken from low-percentage areas), but you can live with that and that should drop out as he gets even strong over his NHL frame. He's a favourite among scouts for the readymade projectability of his tools and his ability to put the puck in the net.

Though Gauthier played mostly the wing at the national program, he's set to play centre at Boston College next season and several NHL clubs that interviewed him at the scouting combine believe that's where he's best suited.

NHL Central Scouting director Dan Marr believes Gauthier isn't far off the consensus top three in this draft of Wright, Slafkovsky and Cooley, and that's not an uncommon belief, so this ranking puts me in the minority (I'd consider him in the fringes of the top 10 but not top five)","Although Gauthier does have the ability to play both left wing and center, his overall game may be suited more to a left-wing role at the next level. His ability to use his stride and his speed to break out wide and fly past defenders in the offensive zone.

This season has seen Gauthier suited to a predominantly left-wing role, which has allowed him to focus on being a little more offensively inclined, as his point totals and overall play in the O-zone has certainly showed.
Overall, there is a LOT to like about Gauthier's entire game. He can be relied upon to get the job done in every single role he's cast into and is certainly in the minds of his opponents whenever his skates touch the ice.

If he can simply fine tune some of the “rough around the edges” aspects to his game mentioned above, as well as continue his developmental path, he'll be a force to be reckoned with in the not-so-distant future.

In terms of his draft position, teams with multiple first-round picks (ARI, BUF, MTL) may be hoping Gauthier is still on the board when their other selections are on the clock. Look for Gauthier to be a mid to late first-rounder this coming July.","Though he played wing a lot this season, NHL teams – and Gauthier himself – see him as a center at the next level. He is expected to be a center at Boston College, where he will go next season. When you include that context, there's a reason he's been one of the biggest risers on draft boards across the league. At 6-foot-3, closing in on 200 pounds, he's a sturdy player with high-end goal-scoring ability and one of the most surehanded players in this draft. The puck stays glued to his stick in a way that I haven't found too common among players at this age. He has a huge pass radius, too, which allows him to collect pucks with a high level of success and turn them into shots or make good decisions to keep plays alive. Gauthier is also an incredibly aggressive player off the puck. He uses his body well to protect or take away pucks. There are some scouts who think he could play in the league as soon as 2022-23 but would be fine if he spent more time developing in college, especially since he needs more reps at center. He does a lot of things well and now that teams are convinced he can be a center at the next level, don't be surprised to see him go especially high in this draft.","A power forward with good feet and a heavy release. Gauthier can play all three forward positions, is smart defensively, and can hurt you on the special teams. If a team believes he can play the middle - which I think he can, then he won't last long on draft day.","There's something to be said for a complementary player who excels in that role, and Cutter Gauthier is that player in the 2022 NHL Draft. Every line he plays on is better for having him on it.
It's the versatility that really stands out in this regard. There isn't a single role or task that the coaching staff can't assign to Gauthier with some degree of confidence that he'll rise to the occasion. He can play any forward position, is every bit as enthusiastic about the defensive details as he is finding the scoresheet, is an absolute menace on the forecheck, and boasts a nice set of hands and a lethal shot.
That shot is the basis of Gauthier's offensive projection to the next level, though. You don't score at nearly a goal a game clip against USHL competition without a wicked release and his qualifies. He pushes his hands in front of his body, elevates his top elbow, and powers through the lever-action release on his wrist shot. It's easily an above-average NHL-lev-el tool as currently constructed.
You couple that release with the soon-to-be Boston College forward's willingness to play the net-front and an almost preternatural knack for being in the right spot at the right time, and the projection only gets that much better. Which, of course, says nothing of his ability to steal possession with his physicality or a well-timed stick lift.
There is some playmaking skill in Gauthier's game to go along with that finishing touch, but it's hardly his selling point. He's a dextrous distributor, capable of feathering the puck through numbers with any pass for the occasion, but he lacks the high-level sense or planning to project as a top-flight playmaker at the next level. Not at this stage in his development anyway.
His skating probably falls in that same range -- about an average if not slightly better projection. Gauthier covers plen-ty of ground, but his upright stance limits his explosiveness and takes away from his ability to shield the puck.
Overall, though, there's a lot to like. You go through our reports, and you'll sense an early appreciation for his game from our group that only got stronger with each viewing. First, Gauthier looked like a mid-round pick. Then, by De-cember, a mid-first-rounder. Now, a player just outside of our top-10, and one that we could easily see going a fair bit higher than that come July 6th in Montréal.
It's easy enough to understand why the league's power brokers might have an even greater affinity for Gauthier's game, too. We may see him as more of a skilled grinder with finishing ability than a pure power forward in the throwback mould, but there's more than a handful of teams out there who go in the opposite direction of us in their assessment of his game.
On the low-end, Gauthier is going to be that middle-six winger with the ability to play anywhere in the lineup that coaches just love to have on their roster; the high-end, a top-line power forward capable of taking over a game or a playoff series. Time will tell where he lands on that spectrum.","Gauthier is a player that matured and progressed as the season went along. He jumped up my list rather quickly and solidified himself in my top 10.  Gauthier's biggest weapon is his shot.  His wrist shot is heavy, accurate, and powerful.  The combination of his size and shot make for a formidable offensive weapon.  He is an above-average skater as well and he proved last season he can play in all situations. Gauthier can score down low, using his size to protect the puck or rip one from the face-off dots.  This ability will be appealing to teams early in the draft.

Gauthier's solid season means he is a potential top 10 in this year's draft. Gauthier projects as a top-six forward at the NHL level. He is likely 1-2 years away from NHL duty.","Cutter Gauthier is a power forward with higher-end skill than your average player of his cut. He makes his presence felt on every shift, throwing his body around and getting involved in every scrum he can. He has the ability to drive transitional play, which is a trait that scouts will value highly. He has impressive puck-handling skills for a player who plays a power game and has above-average skating ability that allows him to keep up with a higher pace of play. He has risen up the ranks all season because of his ability to get to the high-danger scoring areas and use his NHL-caliber shot to beat goalies with a high consistency rate. He has positional flexibility as well, playing both the wing and down the middle. Although he's more comfortable on the wing, it's a nice insurance policy knowing that he is capable of playing multiple positions. He's not an overly flashy player, and won't make any jaw-dropping one-on-one moves that bring the crowd to the edge of their seats, or even out of it. But what he will do is pick up the puck, stick his head down and drive the center lane to create a quality primary scoring chance for himself or a second-chance opportunity for a teammate. If there were any issues or concerns with his game, it's his consistency. One night he will look like the best player on the ice and a go-to threat for his team, but on another he will blend into the crowd a little too much and be a passenger when he's on the ice. This can easily be fixed as he develops and matures more with age. Gauthier is the one player who could very well go earlier than people expect because of his attributes and the fact that NHL teams really value the rare combination of skills that this player possesses."
2022,RW,73,178,24,MIN,11,Danila Yurov,Yurov's skill stands out when you watch him. His stick skills and overall creativity with the puck are high-end. He's a good skater and shows excellent ability to beat defenders with speed or with dekes. He also shows great skill in tight spaces to maintain possession. Yurov can make plays but I wouldn't call his playmaking as dynamic as his stickhandling. He's not overly physical but Yurov works hard to create turnovers and can kill penalties. He projects as a quality top-six winger.,"The first Russian to appear on my list, Yurov's a player that I'm a big, big fan of — and would have likely ranked in the front half of my 6-to-12 tier sooner than the back half were it not for both the uncertainty that looms around Russian prospects and, even without that, the lack of opportunity he was given in the KHL this season. That's a potentially dangerous combination, if his flexibility to come to North America is inhibited and he can't get meaningful minutes in Russia.

He has already proven to be dominant player in the MHL and internationally (in part because of his December 2003 birthday but mostly because of his well-rounded skill level), driving play, chances, and results at both ends. He's a kid who has really impressed me almost every time I've watched him against his peers. If you were to fill up two buckets with his tools (one for the strengths, one for the weaknesses) and place them on a scale, the bucket with his strengths in it would be overflowing and the one with his weaknesses would be near-empty.

He plays hard and fast, he pushes tempo, he's a strong and balanced skater, he's an excellent give-and-go player who excels at playing in and out of space without the puck, his shot comes off of his blade hard in motion (though it could use a little more versatility), he's got pro size and skill, he's diligent in all three zones, and he's almost always in the right position or reading the play to get back into it (on offence or defence). Kids his age are often either advanced in the way they operate on the ice but lack the high-end skill to make the most out of it, or have the skill in spades but struggle to use it because they aren't processing the game fast enough. Yurov doesn't have any problems on either front. He may not become a star, but he's got projectable top-six tools.","If Yurov can work on his stick-handling, he will become a far more dominant offensive forward who can cut to the net with ease. The potential is there. He just needs to work on cradling the puck around attackers and honing in on his deceptive instincts to counteract his attackers' defensive measures.","The uncomfortable geopolitical situation with Russia's ongoing aggression in Ukraine is going to hit the NHL Draft in a significant way. What that means for Yurov, who is one of the best forward prospects in this draft, remains to be seen. He is under contract for one more season with Magnitogorsk and other Russian prospects have managed to get visas to come over since the conflict in Ukraine started. When it comes to hockey alone, Yurov is a top-tier talent in this draft. You wouldn't know it by his pro numbers, but Metallurg never gave him a chance to showcase himself as he'd play one to two shifts, or sometimes no shifts, in games he dressed for. At the U20 level, however, he was dominant. He is a north-south player who has enough skill to get through defenses and baffle goaltenders. He makes smart plays and while he doesn't have a towering frame, his lower body strength is an asset to beat defenders to the inside and make plays close to the net front. He plays a mature, subtly physical game that allows him to win a lot of puck battles and still make high-end plays. The only real concerns about Yurov's game stem from things he cannot control, like how Magnitogorsk uses him and what the visa situation is going to look like next spring. ","There's a lot going against Yurov. The birth certificate is going to come into play on draft day, but spending the majority of his season stapled to the bench in the KHL certainly didn't help matters. He's got a plus-rated toolbox and a very safe floor. We just don't quite know what the ceiling is yet, and what his minuscule minutes over these formative years will do to his overall development.","Few players entered the year with more name recognition than Danila Yurov. Scouts on the team side and in the public sphere alike have been tracking his progress for years now, going as far back as his play at the U17s in the 2019-20 season.
Yet for all the many chapters in the scouting community's book on this player, Yurov's projection is as fraught as any in the 2022 NHL Draft. All that time in the scouting community's sights, and his future has only gone further and further out of focus with time.
The worst part is that this lack of clarity isn't even Yurov's fault. He was too good for the MHL, but Metallurg Magni-togorsk refused to play him when he was with their KHL roster. The 6-foot-1 winger only averaged 3:19 a game in the KHL over 40 regular season and postseason contests, his season-high a whopping 10:37, according to our partners at InStat.
The minutes were more plentiful in the MHL, but the viewings less meaningful. But that's the best Yurov's season offers, so we had to make do.
If nothing else, we got a pretty decent understanding of the tools at his disposal. The most imposing of the lot is probably the Chelyabinsk-winger's footspeed. That was a consistent, positive theme through just about every one of our viewings.
""[Yurov] boasts a powerful skating style. He has quick feet that are capable of generating speed in a hurry via short accelerating strides and quick cross-over laden cuts,"" Elite Prospects Dir. of Film Scouting  wrote in a Film Room deep dive. ""Additionally, once he's going, his posture and mechanics are fairly clean. He blends a strong lower half and core to propel a perpendicular knee bend and recovers under his body well. 
""At Elite Prospects, we have rated him as a 6.5-grade skater. This indicates that his level is that of an above-average skater at the NHL level. As he adds further strength, his mechanics indicate that rating could improve further.""
His plus-level skating, well-maintained mental map of the ice through constant scanning, a willingness to play the body and cut opponents off at the hands, and great lines to the puck made Yurov an excellent forechecking presence in many of our viewings. He's an absolute nuisance on offensive zone retrievals, unrelenting in his pursuit, working every bit as smart as he is working hard. Some of these same principles of his game make him every bit as effective in the defensive zone, where he's a legitimate shutdown force as a winger. He's an engaged off-puck defender, constantly scanning for threats, activating to cut off passes, and closing on threats without hesitation.
You don't start the year off as a potential top-five pick because of strong forechecking and defensive diligence, though. There's a lot to like about Yurov's offensive profile, too. There's the aforementioned skating -- that's the starting point -- but he's also a high-end puckhandler. His hands work independently of his feet, and he has a real knack for getting opposition defenders moving one way and cutting across them in the opposite direction.
""He loves drawing defenders towards him to open up space for his teammates,"" Elite Prospects Russia regional scout Dylan Griffing wrote in a September game report. ""He was egging them by stickhandling 1-on-1 with the puck away from his body, so when the opponent reached for a poke, he brought it back towards himself and moved the puck out of the area. ""Creative rush patterns to constantly find pockets. Really smart player and makes great reads,"" Griffing added later in that same report.
Those hands are probably the best part of his offensive build. Yurov's shot rates as about average, and he's far too reliant on hope passes to rate as anything better than an average distributor at present. The optimist in our staff prob-ably sees his playmaking as a better projection than what we saw this season, with the occasional flash of high-level creativity buoying our assessment. But that's a bit of a leap of faith based on this year's tape.
You're almost certainly getting an NHL-calibre player with Yurov. There's no real concern there. The question is whether he'll be an impact player in the top-six or a mid-dle-six, defence-first winger with adequate puck skill and playmaking chops. It essentially boils down to which sample you find more indicative of his true talent level -- the one of his draft-minus-one and draft-minus-two seasons or his draft year. Time will tell.","Yurov is the highest skilled Russian available in this draft.  It's hard to know whether or not NHL teams will take a chance on Russian players due to some uncertainty in the KHL and the war in Ukraine.  Young players also play lower minutes in the KHL, which can stunt development.  Those factors are hard to predict, but a player like Yurov does have first-round potential and may find his names called in the early to mid-first round.

Yurov has a highly well-rounded offensive tool kit.  He can drive play, create chances off the rush, and is solid in the defensive zone as well.  He is also physically strong for his age and uses his size and strength to his advantage.  While he struggled to score in limited minutes in the KHL, Yurov has put up high point totals against his peers and internationally.  Yurov plays with pace and tenacity and is an excellent combination of high-end tools and effort.

Whether or not Yurov will get to play meaningful minutes next season is a question mark.  This, in turn, can make his development hard to predict.  If he finds a way to play regular minutes next season, Yurov could progress quickly and be NHL-ready in 2-3 years.  Regardless of time, if the package comes together, Yurov projects as a top-six forward at the NHL level.","Danila Yurov has emerged as one of this year's highest upside prospects, and with good reason. He is a highly-skilled, dual-threat forward who is able to attack with a blend of creativity and high-end smarts. The most noticeable aspect of his offensive game is his skill and creativity with the puck on his stick. He's capable of making flashy one-on-one dekes to beat opposing defenders while attacking on the rush, leveraging his smooth puck skills, intelligence and patience to wait out defenders to open up holes to attack through. He sees the ice very well, particularly in the offensive zone where his spatial awareness allows him to identify soft areas of ice to make himself available as a shooter or set up passing lanes into high-danger areas for his teammates. He has a very capable shot that can beat netminders from medium range with either a well-placed wrist shot or a strong one-timer from the circles, while also showing advanced ability as a puck distributor that allows him to make quick reads and find teammates with difficult passes. He also has demonstrated strong smarts on the backcheck and in his own zone, able to pick off errant passes and quickly transition those turnovers into scoring chances. He has been a dominant player at the junior level, and will simply need to learn to penetrate the middle of the ice against stronger and quicker opponents at the pro level with more consistency as he develops. He has the potential to become an impact top-six forward at the NHL level with the ceiling to become a bonafide top-line winger and cornerstone piece for the NHL franchise that decides to draft him. That is, if Yurov is able to continually put all of his tools together while on the ice."
2022,D,73.5,195,10,ANA,12,Pavel Mintyukov,"Mintyukov is an exciting defenseman. He plays with pace and is aggressive as a rusher. His skating allows him to evade pressure easily and transition pucks up ice with his feet. Mintyukov is also highly skilled and can make plays through legs and sticks. He shows good offensive IQ, knowing when to activate and how to make plays with the puck. He also has a hard point shot, making him dangerous on the PP with his skating and vision. Defensively he's solid, showing an ability to use his long reach, mobility and physicality to kill plays. He can be a little too aggressive at times trying to create offense when he leaves his defensive position. He projects as a top-four defenseman with the potential to play high in the lineup.","Mintyukov, who was a top prospect in Russia growing up, was supposed to make the jump from to the OHL last season before it was shut down. It took me some time this year to warm up to him as a result, but he eventually made a fan of me and of the scouting community at large with his play in Saginaw (though I remain a little lower than the consensus). Mintyukov is an adept three-zone player whose game tilts towards offensive through his eagerness to engage in transition and off the offensive zone blue line. When he's looking to be active, he can involve himself in all areas of the game. He's also talented as both a handler and shooter (though I think a couple of highlight-reel plays have exaggerated that a little). Add in an athletic 6-foot-1 frame and there's a lot to like. I do think he can play a little too much on instinct at times (both on offence and on defence) though and that, in concert with the fact that he's a late birthday and should be further along in that regard, leaves me lower on him than the draft's other two top D out of the CHL. The hope is that he'll be able to develop the decision-making aspect a little and that when he does, he'll be able to contribute at both ends at five-on-five and potentially on both special teams as a top-four guy long term.","With Pavel Mintyukov's size, raw tools (including puck skill and passing ability), four-way agility, and deceptive maneuvering around the blue line: it's hard not to see a lottery selection on that assessment alone. There are not many players in this draft class that have the ability to operate in the offensive zone from the backend like Mintyukov can. Add in his ability to suffocate space and his mobility to keep a tight gap: he's an attractive asset in the 2022 draft.

As a life-long Buffalo Sabres fan, where I tend to get really hesitant with Mintyukov is his defensive zone awareness and propensity for chasing highlight reel hits rather than mitigating dangerous chances. It is all to reminiscent to watching Rasmus Ristolainen in a Sabres uniform. The tools are there, he's a physical specimen, but too often I'm watching film of Mintyukov and trying to piece together the thought process behind some of his defensive reads. Some of these issues lie within the structure of Saginaw's neutral and defensive zone set-up and Mintyukov's skill set. However, a lot of it is individual reads that require if/then decisions that Mintyukov will too often not make correctly.

If I'm drafting Mintyukov I'm leaning in heavily on his offensive ability and his ability to create space with his edges and skill. I think he can excel in a defensive system that doesn't lean so heavily on man-to-man defensive zone play. I would also spend a significant time in the film room showing how chasing hits in the neutral zone and at the defensive blue line has allowed teams to use it against him.

If Mintyukov can make those adjustments I think he could end up being one of the better defenders to come out of the 2022 NHL draft.","One of the best goal-scoring defensemen in this draft, Mintyukov navigates the offensive zone brilliantly from the blueline down. He walks the line well with good skating and crafty puck skills. When it comes to shooting, he always seems to find a better lane to make sure his chances are especially dangerous. There are so many instances this season of him making moves to the inside and getting closer to the net to maximize his potential to score. Defensively he's adequate and played a boatload of minutes in key situations for a weaker Saginaw team this season. I think he could be a top-four power-play weapon for a team that likes to activate its defensemen in the offense.","Insert a lot of what I just said about Mateychuk onto Mintyukov but add more size, a more structured offensive style, and about eight months of maturation. The Russian blueliner can get a bit hectic in the defensive end, but he brings a strong package to work with despite missing his entire draft-minus-one season.","There's bouncing back from a lost year, and then there's what Pavel Mintyukov pulled off for the Saginaw Spirit last season. How's nearly a point a game clip on the OHL's fifth-lowest scoring side for bursting back onto the scene?
Just imagine what he would've done with the benefit of a draft-minus-one season under his belt...
Those gaudy point totals accurately reflect Mintyukov's ability and the sort of future that awaits him in the NHL. He's an offensive defenceman by trade and one of the very best players with that profile in this year's draft.
The tools are strong, but Mintyukov mainly relies on his cunning and guile to pick the opposition apart. His process-ing power is just miles ahead of most other players at this stage in their development.
Constant scanning off-the-puck and decisiveness with it made the Russian blueliner one of the most effective high-pace creators in the CHL last season. The one- and two-touch feed were his weapons of choice, and Mintyukov used them to strike with rapier-like precision through any cracks in the defensive formation. And when openings weren't already there, he made them with deceptive handling, look-offs, and feints. ""Mintyukov's puck skill is unique for a defenceman,"" Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting  wrote in a Scout's Notebook article on Mintyukov. ""He easily beats defenders with sound form, hand speed, and projectable setups. But he doesn't overuse them...he plays a give-and-go style, based on short- and medium-range passing, constant movement, and non-stop pressure."" Those puck skills and offensive blue line activations helped the 6-foot-1 defender nearly crest the 20-goal mark. And who knows, maybe he gets across that finish line with a better shot. If there's any weak point in Mintyukov's tool kit, that's it -- particularly the wrister, limited by a reliance on a sweeping motion rather than generating lever-action with downforce.
As one might imagine, those puck skills coupled with an enthusiasm for activating into the play made Mintyukov an exceptional puck-mover, too. He was downright clinical in transition, going through the motions on a breakout like they were routine; deceive on the retrieval, leave a forechecker or two behind with handling skill, and get the puck up ice with pace. It just looked easy for him. The same, of course, isn't true of his play in the defensive zone. Mintyukov has the tools to one day develop into an effective in-zone defender, but he's not quite there yet. He's far too puck-focused and reactive, doesn't time his close-outs well, and struggles to break down multivariable situations. We saw a fair bit of improvement from Mintyukov defensive-ly as the season progressed, but it's still far from a selling point to his game.
Here's the thing, though. You can teach a player with Mintyukov's skill set how to defend at least at an adequate level, but you can't teach someone without his natural ability to create offence or transition the puck in the NHL. That makes the gamble worthwhile. And if you hit, then you're looking at a top-four defenceman with power play utility for many years to come.","Similar to Korchinski, Mintyukov started the season outside the first round for many, and just like Korchinski, his offensive production made it impossible for scouts not to notice him.   Mintyukov averaged almost a point-per-game in the OHL, and on a struggling team.  

Mintyukov is a well-rounded offensive player and showed he can drive play at times in the OHL.  He is comfortable rushing the puck and he is an excellent skater.  He has a decent point shot as well and quarterbacks a powerplay with ease.  

Mintyukov's biggest area of improvement is defensive awareness.  It certainly isn't a weakness, but further awareness is needed in the defensive zone, and he needs to learn to pick his spots better when joining the rush.  Overall, he projects as a top-four defender.  He is likely three years away from NHL duty.  His combination of size and offensive ability should make him an early mid-round target for teams.","Pavel Mintyukov is an offensive-minded defenseman who plays the game with an aggressive mindset. He uses his skating and offensive instincts to jump into the play every chance he can get. His vision and ability to read the defensive zone coverage are impressive for a blueliner. He can anticipate the play really well and adjust his positioning to get into a excellent position to create an offensive chance. When he's at his best, he has excellent playmaking instincts, and can manipulate passing lanes with his eyes and deliver crisp and accurate passes to his teammates in prime scoring areas. He has strong lateral mobility with the puck on his stick, making him a strong power play quarterback and facilitator from the top of the offensive zone. The concerns about him are mostly in relation to his high ‘boom or bust' label. He has flashes of being an elite offensive zone player, but he can go a long time without being at the top of his game. There are inconsistencies in his passing and puck-handling ability, and if he can find a way to level that off it will significantly impact his long-term outlook in appositive way. Defensively he struggles to maintain solid gap control and at angling his opponents away from the perimeter. He's not a liability on defense, but goes through severe ups and downs when it comes to his defending. His game oozes confidence and he can process the game quickly, he just needs to improve on a few key defensive skills and consistency before jumping to the next level. Mintyukov has the potential to be a top-six, maybe even top-four blueliner at the NHL level who plays a significant role running a power play unit. If he doesn't develop, he may struggle to make any five-on-five impact."
2022,D,74,185,7,CHI,13,Kevin Korchinski,"Korchinski has a clear NHL toolkit. He's a 6-foot-2 defenseman who can skate and has offensive abilities. He's able to carry pucks up ice well with his skating, and has excellent edgework to evade pressure. Korchinski shows touch and vision with the puck to run a power play and create off the blue line due to his skill and feet. Despite his size and skating, he's mediocre defensively. He doesn't compete that hard on that side of the ice and is overly aggressive offensively. That's a concern, but he generates so much offense that it makes up for those issues to an extent. Korchinski projects as a top-four defenseman.","Long, smooth-skating, point-per-game defencemen never last long in the draft, and Korchinski won't linger unpicked. I think he's in the same tier and conversation as Mateychuk, even if he slots five spots lower. He was one of the most improved players in the draft this year as he settled into an ambitious, free-flowing game that reminded a little of Stars first-rounder Thomas Harley at the same age, and his June birthday should give him even more runway next season. He handles the puck smoothly on his hip, his impressive footwork and maneuverability help him adjust to, away, and around pressure, and then he reads and anticipates the play at a high level so that he can make something happen out of all of his movement and carries.

I like his stick and his ability to use his feet to defend the rush and disrupt play (though he's a better transition defender than a defensive zone one). His hallmark will always be his near-perfect posture and balance over his skates. He lives and dies trying to guide play with and without the puck with his mobility, pivots and directional changes. He can take over a game with his ability to transport the puck and roam. It was nice to see him look to attack into his shot (which isn't particularly hard) more in the playoffs. There's still some fine-tuning that needs to happen but Korchinski's my fourth-ranked D for a reason and a worthwhile pick as high as the fringes of the top 10.","Three questions I have about Korchinski's projectability:

Is he going to be able to control the pace of play at the NHL level?
How will he adapt to a more physical league?
How will he keep his composure when there is less time to make a decision?
The NHL is a different beast entirely, and while some WHL teams play an NHL style, there's a massive gap in the level of competition. These questions I have aren't going to make or break Korchinski, but they're going to be points where he may struggle early on in his NHL career. With less time to make decisions, Korchinski is going to have to react to plays quickly and maintain his composure. Earlier in the season, I wouldn't have been convinced that Korchinski could handle such challenges. After watching him for the entire season, however, he's proven that he's able to adapt and make changes quickly.

Korchinski has been a hotly debated player among the Smaht Scouting crew
It's easy to see why people can be so divided on Korchinski. The good parts about his game are very good, while the bad parts of his game can be very bad. If you're taking Korchinski based on his upside, you'll have to be prepared for Korchinski to take a few years in the AHL to develop. His game needs a lot of polishing both in the neutral and defensive zones, and the panic that can occasionally overtake him under pressure will need to be worked out as well. Given time, however, Korchinski can be a top four, maybe even top pairing defenseman capable of quarterbacking a power play unit. Give him free rein and he'll become one of the better defensemen in the league. Rein him in, and you're looking at a player that might not be as impactful in the NHL.

Admittedly, I was wrong about Korchinski early on this year. I saw the occasional bad play and refused to see the entirety of his game. At this point, I'm confident that Korchinski goes in the top 15 of the 2022 draft and it wouldn't surprise me if he sneaks into the top ten. As someone that has followed the Hurricanes for a long time, Korchinski reminds me a bit of Joni Pitkanen in the way that he plays in the offensive zone and Noah Hanifin in the way that he skates both in transition and on the blue line. Korchinski will make a team very happy when they select him.","One of the biggest risers all season, Korchinski is still actively playing as we write this. He's in the WHL championship series and, as a top-four defenseman for Seattle, has had a large hand in getting them there. Over the regular season, Korchinski put up big points with 65 in 67 games. He moves pucks exceptionally well, jumps into plays with regularity and has shown an improved goal-scoring skillset in the postseason. He had four regular-season goals and as I write this had six in the playoffs in 22 games. Korchinski is a bit on the lanky side right now, but he's so co-ordinated and smooth. Once he fills out, I think his defending will become more effective and he can hold his own better along the walls and in the tough areas of the ice. Either way, a 6-foot-2 defenseman with fluid mobility and skills is an especially enticing option in the top half of the first round. I think he's got a great shot to be a top-four guy down the line.","One of the most electric offensive defenders in the draft can make opponents look silly on the power play. Korchinski can complete complex dekes before sending a bullet across a fold on the breakout. But he can also miss a target by two feet, get completely clowned on in his own end, and needs to be sheltered. Big upside here, but nearly as big a risk.","There is perhaps no greater gamble in the first round of this year's draft than defenceman Kevin Korchinski. The Seattle Thunderbirds defenceman is about as high-risk, high-reward an option as you'll find.
Let's start with the reward part of the equation. That would be Korchinski's almost unparalleled ability in transition and the offensive zone. There's a reason the Seattle Thunderbirds blueliner led all first-time draft-eligible CHL defenders in points with 65 through 67 regular season contests.
“Korchinski's breakouts follow the framework of the best breakout artists in the NHL: Use the middle, draw pressure, and pass up the ice to the open teammate,” Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting  wrote in a Film Room deep dive on Korchinski. “But he doesn't just abide by the simple formula; he builds off it, reshaping breakouts to perfectly match his skill set.
“Most prospects use the middle lane sparingly. Korchinski attacks it every touch with unwavering confidence. Once he gets the first forechecker chasing, he skates directly at the next one. Sometimes, he fakes them out with handling skill and dekes around them. “Others, he passes under their stick for a long-range breakout pass. If neither is an option, he encourages the forechecker to reach, then he cuts back away from them before moving play to the inside. Either way, the result is the same: he's beat two players, meaning there's an open teammate up the ice.” The results bear out Korchinski's quality on the breakout, with the Thunderbirds blueliner rating in the 98th percentile as a transition player according to the data set that  manually tracked throughout the season.
Many of the same elements that made him so effective on the breakout also reveal themselves in the way that Korchinski drives play in the offensive zone. Rare was the prolonged offensive zone sequence that didn't feature at least one blue line activation from the 6-foot-2 defenceman. And as was the case in transition, Korchinski always worked from the outside in, collecting pucks along the boards and funnelling play towards the slot.
“Korchinski's game is built on individual skill,”  wrote in a Scout's Notebook article on EP Rinkside. “In the offensive zone, he's constantly working laterally; dragging defenders to the outside, cutting back, and heading back to the middle. He's both a shooter and a playmaker, playing off the threat of one to use the other.”
The catch with Korchinski is that you're not getting an especially refined defender. Even that may be a charitable assessment. Frankly, he's one of the worst off-puck defenders to land on the final Elite Prospects draft ranking, so incredibly puck-focused and out of most plays that the Thunderbirds may as well have been down a man with Korchinski on the ice during even strength defensive sequences.
Some of that will improve with even a slight uptick in his engagement level, but it's nonetheless concerning to see a draft-eligible defenceman so completely out of his depth as an in-zone defender. Without significant development to this part of his game, it's hard to imagine an NHL coaching staff having much appetite for playing Korchinski in anything but a bottom-of-the-lineup role – if that.
Make no mistake: You're throwing caution to the wind a bit with a Korchinski selection in the top half of the first round. There's a very real chance that his inability to defend coupled with a below-average skating stride conspire to spoil an otherwise promising career.
Even so, you can't let a player with this upside last much longer than that in this year's draft. Korchinski is one of only a handful of players with power play quarterback, 40-plus points upside from the blue line, and that makes him well worth the risk. Safe is death, right?","Korchinski started the season outside the first round on most draft lists.  However, his stock climbed quickly with a stellar performance for Seattle in the WHL this season.  Averaging almost a point-per-game, Korchinski plays a well-rounded offensive game.  He moves the puck up the ice quickly to his teammates and has an excellent first pass.

Korchinski is an elite skater and loves to fly through the neutral zone.  At 6'2, he has the physical tools to excel at the NHL level.  He is excellent in transition.  Korchinski has a quick stick defensively and can neutralize play through his quick first step and strong positional awareness.  He had a low goal total this season, which has some scouts question his offensive ceiling.  However, his overall toolkit leaves teams a lot to work with, especially with his high-end passing ability.

Korchinski projects as a top-four defender at the NHL level.  He is likely 2-3 years away from NHL duty.","Kevin Korchinski is one of the top offensive defensemen available in this year's NHL Draft. He's a magnificent skater who will dazzle you with his edgework and crossovers as he patrols the offensive blue line. He does a fantastic job of working the puck on the blue line and getting it towards the middle of the ice to get a better shot towards the net. He's got a nice long stride and great acceleration, which allows him to retrieve pucks before anyone else. It also aids him in catching opponents off guard and closing the gap on them quickly. His puck-handling abilities are also a strong point of his game. If he gets the puck under pressure he's able to shake them off with a quick spin, head-fake or some nice stick work and dance around them. He's a solid passer who won't miss any open options, but he also has the odd turnover when an easy option isn't available, calling into question a little bit his ability or desire to keep things on the safer side at times. He is a highly intelligent player who plays at a high pace. While this is great when he or his team has the puck, when it comes to defending he can get a little over-zealous and lose his positioning. He also struggles at times when it comes to using his body to defend physically, though that's an element that may simply come with time. One-on-one battles become a struggle if he's not able to use his stick to strip someone. However, the good news with this is he has size and with lots of room on his large frame to beef up, which may help him tune the physical part of his game. Korchinski showed this season he's got the potential to become a top-four defenseman in the NHL who could also contribute regularly on the power play."
2022,C,72.5,183,30,WPG,14,Brad Lambert,"Lambert is a high-end athlete. His skating ability is explosive. He has great speed and edgework, allowing him to cut away from pressure easily. You combine his skating with strong hands and he's a go-to guy for zone entries. He can make tough plays in motion and shows O-zone creativity. He can use his skating to circle too much at times but this season showed more willingness to attack directly. He's full of potential, even though I've seen him take a lot of nights off. I think he will be a top-six winger in the NHL but he may frustrate coaches.","One of the top prospects in this age group for years, Lambert struggled out of the gate this season due to a combination of injury, illness, his own play, and the struggles of his team. Then, in search of a reset after flashing his skill at the short-lived world juniors, he left JYP, his team of the last two seasons, to return to the Pelicans, the team he was brought up in (and, at year's end, an agency move as well). He was better than his numbers (the four goals on 132 shots in Liiga for a 3 percent shooting percentage reveal that much, and so does a close examination of his looks) for sure, but the inconsistency of his play and the mid-season move raised more questions than answers.

Still, Lambert is undeniably one of the most gifted players in this class. When he's feeling good, he's fearless with the puck, makes a ton of plays in control, and looks to dictate in possession. He also has both the hands and the skating to create (each of which grade out at the top of the draft). He's got excellent control of his outside edges which allow him to carve up coverage on cutbacks and carries.

He's slippery because of his ability to spin away from his man and make a play. He's a good passer off his backhand. Some scouts worry about Lambert's game without the puck in terms of both his intensity off of it and his ability to make things happen offensively when he's not getting a ton of touches. With it, though, Lambert's a multi-faceted threat who blends impressive puck skill with good all-around skating mechanics and an attack mentality that complements a dangerous curl-and-drag shot (which also complements the short stick he uses).

He plays pucks into space beautifully, gets to the interior (against his peers, at least), splits lanes, cuts off the wall aggressively (though again, more often against his peers than pros), and has a low base to his stride that allows him to extend plays (though he does have a bit of a hunch to his posture, which can put him off balance). He's excellent on the point and half wall on the power play because of his puck skill, dangerous wrister off the flank and playmaking instincts but he's going to have to make plays more consistently at even strength to fulfill his top-six upside. Even after everything, I thought about ranking him a couple of spots higher than this.","First line forward if his shot develops nicely. If he struggles to develop his shot, then you are probably looking at a top nine forward projection.","Perhaps the most polarizing player in the class, Lambert has tools that suggest he should be an elite player. He is a sublime skater, probably the best in this draft class, and has a higher-end skill set as well. The issue with Lambert is that we've basically seen him in Finnish pro hockey for three years with little to no progression beyond continued physical development. He played for three teams in the last three years and had the same results. In fact, he had fewer points this season than he did last. His inability to get to the interior of the ice consistently is an especially large concern about his game as he can't simply be a perimeter player. That has sparked concerns about his hockey sense and his competitiveness. I've talked to scouts who say the tools are worth the risk and I've talked to others who would advocate for his team not to draft him at all. I've come down somewhere in the middle, but I recognize the risk that exists in hanging a first-round pick on him. If you watched him play one game and saw the skating and the hands, you'd say this player is one of the very best prospects, but the rest just doesn't stand up to scrutiny as well. ","A terrific combination of speed, shot, and stickhandling, but even with all those physical tools, Lambert lacks the tool belt to carry them around. Effort level and consistency issues seem to follow him around as well. There's boom here, but also a healthy dose of bust.","That we could get to the 2022 NHL Draft with Brad Lambert barely clinging to the fringes of the top-10 would've seemed impossible as recently as a year ago. But even that might be a generous assessment of his stock based on our staff's conversations with industry sources.
It's been quite the fall from grace for Lambert, who was once thought of as Shane Wright's primary challenger for the first overall pick in this year's draft.
Even a cursory glance at his Elite Prospects player page helps tell the story of his free falling draft stock. The first thing you'll notice is that Lambert produced less in his draft year (10 points in 49 games) by raw and per-game points than he did in his draft-minus-one season (15 points in 46 games) despite playing in three more contests. Never a good sign.
Keep digging, and you'll find that he flew from JYP Jyvaskyla to the Lahden Pelicans at about the halfway point in the season, reuniting with the organization that housed him for his age 14 and 15 seasons. The decision to join the Pelicans following a mutually agreed-upon termination of his contract with JYP was supposed to be the change of scenery that spurred Lambert to more productive ends. If nothing else, he'd get more ice-time, or so that was the thinking at the time. The results? Same ol', same ol'. If anything, one could make a case that Lambert's fortunes took a turn for the worse. He was playing 14:07 a game in all situations with JYP, scored six points in 24 games, generated seven expected goals, and helped his team control 52 percent of the shot attempts at evens, according to our partners at InStat. With the Pelicans, Lambert played 14:21 a night, picked up four points in 25 games, scored 4.6 expected goals, and saw his team's share of the on-ice attempts drop to 43 percent.
Elite Prospects' Dir. of European Scouting Lassi Alanen tracked every one of Lambert's games last season. His data set tells the same story -- Lambert's outputs mostly suffered the mid-season transfer to the Pelicans.
So, I guess this is the part of the scouting report where you begin to wonder why we've still placed him 14th overall on our final board? It's simple, really. For all the red flags we've already addressed (and the many more that we've yet to broach...), Lambert remains one of, if not the most sin-gularly skilled player in this draft.
Certainly, the 6-feet-tall pivot is the best mechanical skater and handler in this draft. There's no real debate there among our staff. He flies up and down the ice with perfect skating posture, ample flexibility through his ankles, knees and hips, and a stable upper body. His top hand is pushed out, free from his torso, and he cradles the puck at the heel of his blade with quickness and precision that most players can't match.
That these considerable physi-cal gifts haven't conferred enough of an advantage to produce strong surface level or underlying re-sults in the Liiga is perhaps a bit peculiar, but hardly a mystery.
Lambert, as currently con-structed, is less than the sum of his parts. So much of his supreme ability is undone by a desire to make highlight-reel plays where simpler ones would suffice. To borrow a line from Elite Pros-pects lead scout , ""Lambert abuses his skills to the utmost degree.""
Many on the team side have come to view these deficien-cies as revealing a lack of hockey sense, perhaps fairly, too. Lambert's sense checks out as an about average projection for us, but it's not at the level necessary to play centre in the NHL. Not in a high-leverage part of the lineup anyway, and that's where someone with Lambert's skill level will need to play to succeed.
His is one of the more fraught projections in this year's draft, and we think that the wide range of rankings in the public sphere and the esteem in which the industry holds him speaks to that. Lambert will need to modulate his pace better, learn to  handle contact, get inside with more fre-quency, and simplify his game to really be a top-of-the-lineup player at the NHL level.
There's a lot of work ahead for Lambert and whichever team drafts him, but the payoff could be so rich as to make any team that passed on him from about third overall onward regret that decision for a decade-plus.","Lambert may be the most divisive prospect in this year's draft.  After a stellar 16-year-old season, playing against men in Finland's top league, Lambert took a huge step back this season.  He jumped around teams quite frequently and only managed 10 points this season.

He did, however, look rather solid in Finland's 2 games at the World Junior Championship, posting 5 points in 2 games.  Lambert is a highly skilled offensive forward when on his game.  He has excellent speed and quick hands.  He can run a powerplay, slow down play with his puck skills, or beat you on the rush.  When on the top of his game, Lambert's skill and creativity help his team maintain possession and there are times it would appear that he can drive a line on his own.

However, consistency is a huge hurdle in his game at the moment.  When he's on his game, he looks like a top-5 talent.  When he's off, he can be a defensive liability at times.  Lambert has also bounced around teams and leagues quite a bit over the last few seasons.  Playing for one team, consistency may help with some of these issues next season.

If all the tools come together, Lambert could easily be a top-six forward at the NHL level.  That being said, he has major boom or bust potential, meaning if he doesn't pan out in this role, he's unlikely to be a regular NHL player.  He is like 2-3 years away from full-time NHL duty.","Brad Lambert is a great-skating forward with the offensive tools to be an elite player, while also showing large flaws that justify his plummet down NHL Draft boards. Comfortably, he is a top skater in this year's class. Aided by the wider ice in Finland, he uses this skill to be a constant threat in transition. He has two main threats when in the offensive zone. First, his vision can find open teammates' sticks and set them up with great chances. When not given the space to fire off these special passes, he can easily create that space. His great hands, aided by strong skating, makes him shifty and slippery for opposing defenders. His vision and puck skills are also among the top of his class. His shot is fairly average among first-round caliber players, but is also a secondary part of his game. In the offensive zone, there is some fair criticism of his game. Far too often, he can go for a home run when more practical options are available. He is less adept in the defensive zone, too. He struggles on defensive zone coverage. Additionally, risky plays at the offensive blue line and neutral zone can also harm his team when he does not capitalize. And, of course, the lacking point production is a major red flag. He is a risky prospect, but his game tape shows a massively gifted offensive threat with the potential to be a great playmaking center in the NHL. Due to his struggles in Finland this season, it would not be surprising to see him continue his development in North America, either at the AHL or in the CHL. Lambert is comfortably a top-10 talent in the draft, with potential to be a great play-driving center in an NHL top-six should he pan out. The question is whether or not he will overcome his flaws to."
2022,D,70.5,194,12,CBJ,15,Denton Mateychuk,"Mateychuk is an undersized but dynamic defenseman. His skating pops, showing very quick feet that can easily transition pucks up ice with speed or evade pressure easily. Mateychuk attacks with the puck using his skill, skating and vision, making him a threat off the rush and blue line to create chances He can play with pace, but can also make passes off the point and use his hard shot to create offense. He defends well in the WHL due to his feet but at 5-foot-11 the concern for scouts is how well he'll be able to check in the NHL. It's a reasonable concern but I think he's so talented and the skating is so good that he will find a way to succeed and become a top-four defenseman.","Mateychuk has built quite the reputation for himself in hockey circles for his ability to direct play and drive results when he's on the ice. That style helped him work his way onto Team Canada at last year's U18s as an underager and it made him one of the top defencemen in junior hockey this season (and my No. 1-ranked CHL defenceman for 2022). He's already a plus-level skater, which helps him escape pressure with his feet, push up ice in control or trialing in transition, walk the line, and steer opposing players into tough spots despite not being the biggest guy. He's the definition — or close — of the modern defenceman. Mateychuk pushes when he can and everything he does is done with poise and command. He plays a reliable and calculating game built around his mobility and sound decision-making. Plus he's a July birthday so he's got plenty of time to build on his strong foundation and develop his distinguishing qualities (namely his movement and control of the game). He just always seems to be involved in all three zones. I see clear top-four upside.","In the 2022 NHL draft class there isn't a player I enjoy watching more on a nightly basis than Denton Mateychuk. He is a unicorn as a defender. There isn't an archetype that he really fits into, which makes him a polarizing player to categorize and rank. 

He's not a player that is going to fit into a system that wants their defensemen to be passive in transition by passing the puck up to the forwards, nor a system that doesn't want their defensemen to activate from the blue line in the offensive zone. He is at his best when the puck is on his stick, driving transitional play, and having the offense flow through him. Even if his puck handling skill drives down the effectiveness of his rush offense; his intelligence, passing ability, off-puck awareness and aggressiveness will still make him an effective offensive defensemen. 

If his mobility is able to reach a level that isn't too far off from where he is now: an aggressive projection for Mateychuk would be an elite offensive catalyst from the backend with the ability to mitigate defensive zone transitions which would erase concerns about his size. Conservatively, he projects as an aggressive, high-event style defensemen who you bet will create more chances than he'll give up. I, personally, lean to his highest ceiling due to his consistent impact on the offensive end of the ice in my viewings, but the concerns are valid.","A high-end, playmaking defenseman who has excellent mobility thanks to superior edge work and skating ability, Mateychuk might not get as much love as some of the next-tier defensemen because of his average size. That said, he's not so small that it will distract anyone from what he's able to do with the puck on his stick. He reads defenses well, gets pucks to the right places at the right time and has supreme confidence in his overall ability. I think he defends at a very solid level, but I don't know that it's so good you can say he's a surefire top-four, big-minutes defenseman. Based on the offensive toolkit, though, I think he is definitely in that discussion and could be one of the more talented blueliners to come out of this draft.","There's never been a play that Mateychuk didn't want to get a touch on. He activates into the play extremely well, providing support, leading the rush, or opening up lanes. His rush defence has blossomed this season, and the awareness is high-end. There's a world where he ends up as the most impactful defender in the crop. His style is where the defensive position is heading.","Denton Mateychuk treats his positional assignment like a suggestion, one he defies with reckless abandon. He's a mercenary every time he takes the ice, unbound by even the most time-honoured conventions of his role.
It's like he's everywhere at once, shouldering an enor-mous burden for his team like it's nothing at all -- cueing the breakout, leading the rush or joining it as a trailer, supporting the puck, leading the forecheck (yes, seriously), shutting it down between the blue lines, and containing in small-area defensive scenarios.
""The result of the constant activation is numerous,"" Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting  wrote in a mid-season Scout's Notebook. ""For one, Mat-eychuk averages 150 puck touches per game, more than 50 above the average top pairing WHL defenceman. The activation ensures he's always gapped up in the event of a turnover, which blends with his projectable rush defence and play-killing instincts. And he's always sprinting up the ice. It's exhausting to be on the opposite side.”
Some of that is going to change as the talent pool com-presses around the Winnipeg-born blueliner. It'll have to. The considerable skills advantage that informs Mateychuk's freewheeling, caution-to-the-wind playing style in the WHL won't be there at the next level. Not to the same degree, anyway. This, of course, says nothing of the willingness of even the most progressive NHL bench bosses to let this happen on their watch.
His style may have to change (though to what degree is unknown), but that doesn't mean that Mateychuk's quality has to diminish too much as a result. There are many projectable parts that make up the sum of his game; components that, individually, all rate as average-to-above-average NHL projections.
Let's start with the Warriors defender's transition game; we'll build this picture from the goal line out. Mateychuk is clinical on the breakout, scanning for threats and options on the retrieval, stacking deception onto his first touch, dragging the F1 into the defensive zone only to dart past him -- it's all too easy for him. His forward stride may lack a separating gear, but his four-way mobility, puck-protection mechanics, and the ability to find outlets under pressure make him nearly untouchable.
Constant motion allows Mateychuk to break from his team's structure in the offensive zone and seek opportunities that just aren't there for other defencemen. He prods for soft ice, finds it, and times his entrance into that space at the best possible moment for a shooting opportunity or a chance to hit his teammate elsewhere with a perfectly weighted pass for a chance of their own. Taking things back in the other direction, Mateychuk does his best defensive work in the neutral zone. He gaps up early, maintains good backwards skating posture, takes away space with his stick, and angles opponents excep-tionally well.
Things get a bit more helter-skelter for Mateychuk during in-zone defensive sequences, but it's still a part of his game that projects as average-to-above-average at the NHL level. His switches aren't great, but he generally does a good job of identifying off-puck threats and acting proactively to take away their time and space.
The evolution of Mateychuk's game will be a fascinating part of his development to track. There just isn't really a blueprint or a set of priors to lean on for someone with his profile. That makes him one of if not the most com-pelling player in this draft, if nothing else.
Overall, though, we're reasonably confident in Mateychuk's ability to find his way and carve out a top-four career in the NHL. It's just a matter of how he does it, and that's more of a point of curiosity than anything.","A stereotypical modern-day defender, Mateychuk averaged a point-per-game in the WHL and his offensive game stood out leaps and bounds.  

Mateychuk is a highly intelligent player and an excellent passer.  His speed stands out and he loves to use it to get out of trouble in the defensive zone and to move the puck up the ice quickly in the offensive zone.  Highly mobile, Mateychuk plays an overall mature game.  While his offense stands out clearly, he is solid defensively as well.  He has excellent gap control and breaks up plays with ease.

Overall, Mateychuk projects as a top-four defender at the NHL level.  He needs to gain some strength, but his size shouldn't be an issue at the NHL level.  He is likely 2-3 years away from NHL duty.","Denton Mateychuk is an offensively gifted defenseman who exudes confidence when he has the puck. His desire to be a difference-maker is noticeable every time he steps on the ice. He's a terrific skater who has a wide stance with a low center of gravity which allows him to get a lot of power with each stride. Coupled with the powerful stride, he displays great edgework that he's able to utiilize in many ways, whether it's working the offensive blue line to get a better lane to the net, making opponents miss as he's rushing the puck up the ice, or shaking forecheckers off as he retrieves the puck in his own end to start a breakout. He also processes the game at an elite level, which makes him a force in the offensive zone. He's great at picking his spots to pinch in order to sustain pressure for his team, and he reads the play so well that he's able to jump off the blue line into some open ice to make himself a dangerous option. The odd time one of his reads doesn't go as planned, he's got the determination to get back in time defensively to minimize any opportunity against his team. He can be an aggressive defender in his own zone, too. He uses his anticipation to cut off cycle attempts or any cross-ice passes near him. Due to him trying to read the play so often, there are moments where he can lose his check because he's trying so hard to beat the puck to where it's going next. He can shore that up as he matures. He could also benefit from adding weight to his frame. He's just not able to impose himself physically on others, which may hinder his defensive abilities. Mateychuk's best-case projection could be as high as a top-pair blueliner, but can become a top-four who quarterback's a power play unit."
2022,C,72.75,187,8,DET,16,Marco Kasper,"Kasper was easy to spot even in SHL games because of how powerful an athlete he is. He would often be the guy to wind it up in his own end to carry the puck due to his great speed and skill. Kasper has a strong 6-foot-1 frame, isn't afraid to attack the hard areas, and can win some battles versus men as a 17-year-old. Kasper attacks with speed and skill, and while he can pull up to make a play or use his hard shot, his direct style of play will translate to the NHL. He projects as a quality top-two line center.","You won't find anyone in the SHL, with the Austrian hockey federation, or working for an NHL club in amateur scouting who doesn't like Kasper's game and approach to it. He really impressed scouts all year with the way he managed one of the world's top pro levels, but especially in the playoffs, where he was really good by any measure for a player his age (before holding his own at men's worlds).

I love his patience with the puck. He doesn't shy away from trying to beat or out-wait guys (whether through changes of directions out of stop-ups or curls) and he's got a really low panic threshold. He's also a good skater who never lacks in effort and always stops on pucks. He's an advanced 200-foot forward (it's worth pointing out that while he's listed as a centre by NHL Central Scouting and often discussed as one, he actually played exclusively the wing this year) who was able to progress up levels because of his rounded game. And while he looks a little skinny out there, he's feisty and he fights off his fair share of checks to stay on pucks. There's also a bit of a hunch to his stride but he leverages his edges well, building speed through the neutral zone to push pace with the puck. I don't see game-breaking skill or finishing, per se, but he plays with pro pace, he's a good passer, he plays on the interior, and makes plays all over the ice. He projects as a contributing NHL player.","Kasper is one of my favorite prospects in this class. He has everything that you want in a power forward. The grit, the decision making and the speed. Kasper has the potential to be a top six forward in the NHL and his grit will intrigue plenty of teams. If a NHL team is looking to obtain a well-rounded power forward who can be annoying in high danger situations with his reach, Kasper is the guy. ","Among the most well-rounded two-way centers in this class, Kasper plays an especially mature game and just got better and better as the year went on. He averaged 11:44 for Rogle in the regular season, then saw his ice time increase to 14:16 per game in the postseason where he had six points in 13 games for one of the league's top teams. Kasper has good defensive skills and commitment to playing an all-around game. It took him a while to find his footing offensively in the SHL playing against men, but he got there and by the end of the season looked not only like he belonged, but that he could start executing at the level that made him a factor in games. He maximizes his 6-foot-1 frame and has a little bit of edge to his game. There is absolutely no quit in him on or off the puck, which makes him a bear to play against. As he gets more confident, the offensive numbers are going to come because he has the skill and skating ability to take his numbers to another level in the coming years. All he needs is a little more patience, a little more strength and more ice time and it should come for him.","There are few 18-year-olds who play as mean-spirited and pace-driven a game at the professional level as Kasper does. The heavy centre is loaded with tools and while none may be all that electric, he's extremely translatable. Overly tenacious but with an intelligence to it. High floor, but of a lower ceiling, and a future fan-favourite.","If you're looking for a throwback forward in this year's draft, look no further. Marco Kasper is as violent and competitive a hockey player as you'll find in the entire class.
He plays every shift like it's his last and it's taking place in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final. Nearly every one of our staff's Kasper viewings starts with the Austrian winger taking a run at someone on his first shift, and the hits just keep on comin'. They're a part of his game from puck drop to the final horn, no matter the score or the stakes.
As Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting  noted in a mid-season Scout's Notebook article, there's a real method to the madness, too. ""Kasper's physicality isn't mindless. It's integral to his game. He seems to thrive when turning hockey into pinball,""  wrote. ""Because when he's locked into the physical aspect, he's also winning footraces on pucks, turning board battles into inside-lane attacks, and stretching the ice with well-timed sprints to the opposing blue line.""
It's the net-front where Kasper's sturdy, physical brand of hockey is most effective, though. Just check out the InStat shot chart from all of the 6-foot-1 winger's season, and you'll find that only three of the 19 goals he scored last year occurred away from the blue paint.
That he managed to play such a taxing game almost exclusively in professional men's league settings this year -- internationally and at the club level alike -- just makes it that much more impressive. There's punching above your weight, and then there's what Kasper did with ROgle BK and Austria this season.
And while it may have been true at one point this season that Kasper's game lacked another dimension to add to his physicality and close quarters scoring, that's no longer the case. His skill and sense are never going to rate as elite-level tools at the professional level, but they've grown to the point where they're now comfortably average-to-above-average projections.
His rush patterns through the neutral zone are far more diverse and manipulative than the straight-line attacks of the season's first few months, and his pace with the puck has followed a similar trajectory. Some of the more advanced playmaking opportunities still elude Kasper, but he's regularly finding teammates through traffic and even showing a bit of a delay game with the puck. You just can't tell the story of Kasper's season without acknowledging the leaps and bounds that he's made with the puck on his stick. At this point, there just aren't many holes left in his game, period. Every tangible component of his profile is at an average-to-slightly-above-average level, and the intangibles are all at an elite level.
You talk to the people who've gotten to know Kasper the person as much as they have the player, and they just rave about his work ethic, coachability, competitive nature, and generally great demeanour. The next bad thing we hear about Kasper will be the first.
Where we once saw Kasper as a bottom-six, checking line winger at the NHL level, he's grown so much in such a short time that a complementary role in a team's top-six doesn't seem out of the question. And there are many teams in the league who hold him in even better esteem, so don't be sur-prised when he goes higher than where we've ranked him.","Kasper is a player that is likely to be taken around the tenth pick in the draft, even with low offensive numbers.  The Austrian played in all situations in Sweden's top league, however, and showed an ability to play a strong two-way game.

Kasper plays center, which will bode well for his name being called early in the 2022 draft.  Overall, Kasper plays a well-rounded game in all three zones.  He's tenacious on the forecheck, competes at a high level, and is defensively responsible.  Scouts have made note all season that Kasper plays a highly mature game.  He is patient with the puck as well and can set up and break up plays with ease.  Kasper loves to play close to the blue paint and isn't afraid to chase pucks into tough areas.  He did this against men last season and was dominant at times, meaning he could continue to be dangerous this way at a higher level as he develops.

The biggest question surrounding Kasper is his upside, particularly his offensive ceiling.  Kasper projects as an NHL player, but there are questions as to whether he is a top-six or bottom-six forward.  I personally project Kasper as a middle-six forward at the NHL level, a player who can pitch in offensively while simultaneously remaining defensively sound.  He is likely 2-3 years away from NHL duty.","Marco Kasper is a speedy and skilled forward with so much to like in his game. With a strong willingness to play in the high-danger areas of the ice, he will take a beating to create scoring chances and drive offense. Playing at an extremely high pace, his feet are constantly moving, and he's able to build up a ton of speed quickly through crossovers and quick cuts. His speed makes him difficult to defend on the rush as he can easily beat defenders wide when attacking the zone. When going wide isn't an option, he has the puck skills to play one-on-one and beat his man with the use of quick hands. With how intense he plays, it's no surprise that he thrives in tight spaces where his high-end motor enables him to drive through checks and win battles on the board for possession of the puck. He doesn't back down or shy away in these instances one bit. Because of this skill, he directly makes positive impacts to his teams overall possession time while on offense. He doesn't have the greatest velocity on his shot, however, which limits his effectiveness from further out when putting the puck on net. This is something he will eventually get better at as he builds up strength but again, he succeeds because of how well he is able to get to the front of the net. With how strong his effort level is, it's no surprise that he is already showing signs of a solid two-way player. He's got some versatility as well, with the option of placing him down the middle or on the wing depending on the set of circumstances. The offensive production may never be elite at the NHL level for him, but the micro-stats is where Kasper will be very impactful given his willingness and determination to attack with ferocity."
2022,LW,72.75,201,19,MIN,17,Liam Ohgren,Calling Ohgren a goal scorer isn't a novel observation given his stats this season but he's shown he can score goals in a variety of ways. He has great hands and can create offense through his skill. He generates a lot of offense around the high-percentage areas because of his strength and compete. Ohgren also has a shot that can score from range. He's smart enough with the puck to move it well but is more of a shooter and worker than a playmaker. His skating is OK. I've heard from scouts who like it but I've never seen a player who can separate with speed. He projects as a top-nine winger.,"Ohgren put together one of the most productive age-adjusted seasons in the history of Sweden's top junior level and two strong performances internationally for Sweden (first at last year's Hlinka Gretzky Cup, and then more recently at U18 worlds, where he was also the team's captain) in his draft year. He's a bigger, stronger player than his two contemporaries in Djurgården and while he doesn't have Lekkerimaki's dynamism or Ostlund's breeziness, that doesn't make him any less interesting as the shot-and-pass, power-and-finesse combination player that he is. I love the way he shades into and away from pressure in control. His shot comes off his blade quick, hard and naturally, rocking it back into his stance and letting it go (it really pops). His offensive arsenal is multi-faceted and he's got some really sneaky craftiness and evasiveness to his game to complement the tools of strength over the puck/through his shot that are obvious. He'll need to pick up a step to translate his game to the pro level, but I wouldn't call his skating an impediment (it's better than he usually get credit for) and he's always finding ways to get to pucks and/or get open around the home plate area inside the offensive zone, where his skill and shot take over.","Ohgren plays an excellent two-way game that is translatable at the NHL level. With his speed and skill, I don't think there will be a long wait before he is playing at the NHL level. He probably needs at least one season in the Allsvenskan before he is ready to make the jump. 

In terms of projection, Ohgren's tool-kit will allow him to be impactful no matter what line he is on. He is a Swiss Army Knife. You can plug him on the top lines and use him to hunt pucks down low on the forecheck. He will get those pucks and wire passes to the slot to drive production. In certain situations, you could plug him in a third line checking role, but I do believe that will slow down his offensive production as the forwards that he is with more than likely won't be capitalizing at the same rate as the forwards on the top two lines.","A strong, committed forward with a heavy, accurate shot, Ohgren is a gifted two-way player who excels in the offensive zone. He's not much of a driver, which is why I think he could slip a little further in the first round, but he is an absolute finisher. The things he can do from the tops of the faceoff circles down make him stand out. Ohgren has good physical strength, he competes at a good enough level to win puck battles and that shot is legit. He averaged more than a goal per game in 30 games in Sweden's top U20 league. He wasn't as effective as a pro as I think he needs to be to improve his pace, but there's definitely some special offensive tools that are enhanced by the strength he possesses. Ohgren is a handful to play against, too.","Ohgren wasn't the fastest or even the most skilled offensive player on his own team this past year, but that didn't stop him from leading them on the scoresheet and in the room. He popped above a goal-per-game in the J20, captained the Swedes at the U18s and showcased his direct and mature style in 25 SHL contests. He has the ability to be a chameleon and fill whatever role is needed up and down the lineup. Underrated hands and feet with a rocket of a shot. He's smart and tenacious. This kid is a pro.","All Liam Ohgren did last season was put up ridiculous point totals in nearly every setting that was fortunate enough to have him.
His 58 points in 30 J20 Nationell games in Djurgårdens' was the fifth-highest mark in league history among first-time draft-eligible prospects, and his 1.93 points per game the new record for per-game scoring. He finished second on Sweden's Hlinka-Gretzky bronze medal-winning roster, and fourth on their gold medal-winning U18s squad.
Perhaps the most impressive stat of all, though, is Ohgren's 33 goals in 30 regular season contests in the J20, 28 of which came at even strength; that number grows to 35 goals in 36 games if you include the postseason.
The only place where Ohgren failed to find the scoresheet with any regularity was in the SHL with Djurgårdens men's squad; a league where first-time draft-eligibles usually don't even play and on a team so poor that their season ended with relegation to the HockeyAllsvenskan.
Everything happens in motion for Ohgren. He gets moving as pucks arrive at his position, skates through his passes, and doesn't need to break stride to get off his shot. He plays at such a heightened pace that the puck often flies from his stick no sooner than you realize he's even secured possession in the first place.
This breakneck pace was a bit of a double-edged sword for our staff. On the one hand, we came to appreciate the urgency of Ohgren's game and how it resulted in offensive opportunities nearly every time the puck touched his stick in the J20 circuit. On the other hand, it made getting a read on any of his non-skating tools a tad bit difficult.
""The shorter and less frequent puck touches make it harder to evaluate the range of his tools, but with the right devel-opment, most of them should become above NHL average in a few years,"" Elite Prospects lead scout  remarked in a Scout's Notebook article. ""Ohgren can offer speed, handling skills, and even a physical presence. His strong skating posture and his knee and ankle flexion allow him to protect the puck against opponents down low and chase them on the forecheck. If they take too long to move the puck, they usually end up plastered on the boards. 
You can credibly count Ohgren among this draft's du-al-threat scorers, but his shot is doing far more damage than his setups. The 6-foot-1 winger has a wide array of releases suited to any situation and has shown an excellent knack for changing the angle or the release point on his shot to take advantage of developing screens or windows in the defensive coverage.
Now, there's a bit of a catch here, and it's that Ohgren didn't always play with the same level of enthusiasm in the defensive zone as he did the offensive one. His physicality and his off-puck sense are such that the basis is there for at least an adequate level of defensive play as he rises up the ranks of professional hockey, but the work rate wasn't always there in our viewings. That's going to have to change for Ohgren to play a high-leverage role in the big leagues.
The other concern among our staff is that the Swedish forward wasn't always much of a planner with his puck touches. It wasn't uncommon for Ohgren to run out of time or space and have to circle back or turn the puck over where even a little forethought would've made all the difference.
There's no such thing as a fully-formed player at the NHL Entry Draft, though, and Ohgren will have plenty of time to round out his game en route to a productive career as a middle-six scoring winger in the NHL.","The 2022 draft is a little light on high-end Swedish prospects.  That being said, there are still a few options available for teams in the first round, and Liam Ohgren is at the top of my list.  Ohgren is a strong, prototypical Swedish forward.  He is a well-rounded offensive player with a strong release and excellent offensive instincts.  He also isn't a liability defensively.  More of a goal-scorer, Ohgren disguises his shot well and can rip it from anywhere with ease.  He is physically mature and is closer to NHL-ready than many of his peers.

Scouts have some questions surrounding his offensive ceiling, especially considering his struggle to put up points when he did play games in Sweden's top league.  However, the combination of size and shot make him a strong first-round candidate with middle-six potential at the NHL level.  Ohgren is likely 2-3 years away from NHL duty.","Liam Ohgren is a phenomenal offensive winger who has a variety of ways to create offense if given space in the opponent's zone. For one, he is a fantastic puck distributor. He can dish the puck to open teammates, especially below the circles on his usual power play spot. When with the puck, he can deke and dangle opponents when needed to bypass defenders. In flashes, he shows top-end skill and brilliance that indicate he is one of the highest-upside players in the draft class. While the skill with his hands and playmaking ability are his primary offensive tools, he also does impress with his shot. He can quickly change angles and manipulate his shot angle in order to release quick pucks off that can either beat goalies or create rebound opportunities. The only thing he needs to do to his offensive game: simplify. Too often he will try to do too much and lose possession of the puck, causing ill-timed turnovers. With a more developed, simple, and practical game, he can become an even better offensive threat. In the defensive zone, his play takes an expected dip. His positioning could be better, often seen cheating for offense. Probably most worrisome, his use of his stick is not ideal. He tries too often to pokecheck his opponents, when a less aggressive, more positional style of defense would have been more suitable in defending the rush. He should see his name called in the first round of the NHL Draft, considering his multifaceted offensive game is one of the best in the draft class. With a more patient attitude in the offensive and refinement in the defensive zone, best-case Ohgren should develop into a second-line scoring winger who performs well on the power play for his team."
2022,C,75,196,11,ARI,18,Conor Geekie,"Geekie has drawn a lot of interest from NHL teams because he's a 6-foot-3 center with a high skill level. With his hands and reach he's able to consistently maneuver pucks through sticks and legs to create chances. He's a big man who doesn't shy away from physical contact, which combined with his skill makes him tough to deal with down low and strip the puck from in general. Geekie can make plays and run a power play, showing good vision and finish from the perimeter. His main flaw, like his brother Morgan's was, is his skating. He's a better skater than his brother and can separate occasionally at the WHL level but doesn't project to do so in the NHL. Geekie projects as a middle-six center with a chance to play higher in the lineup.","Geekie is a big centre with clear skill as a handler and passer. I debated ranking him as high as No. 13 here as a result. But his modest production this season and a few uninspiring viewings (after an excellent rookie year) left me just a little more hesitant about him than the three names ahead of him here. He's got impressive hands and body control for his size, which helps him control pucks inside the offensive zone and make plays while also getting the upper hand in board battles. He plays through bumps and thrives taking pucks from the cycle to dangerous areas.

He also skates well enough for his size. It's certainly not going to be a strength but I don't see it as the huge issue that some do and I think he moves better than his big brother Morgan (now with the Kraken) did at the same age, and creates his fair share pushing up ice in transition as a result. I do find he forces things too much by trying to go one-on-one and create something that's not there, and there's a bit of a hunch to his stride that will need straightening out. He's got some work to do in the faceoff circle, too. But it's hard to deny the impressive size-hands combination he has considering his length. He's got a real ability to hang onto the puck, draw players into him, and then facilitate through or around them. He makes an unusual amount of soft little plays for a player his size, and can attack into coverage because of his hands. He's really quite comfortable in control of the puck. Geekie's a legitimate prospect with a desirable set of skills.","I hinted at my projection for Geekie earlier. I believe that Geekie can be a top line NHL player if his skating gets to be NHL average or better. That's the biggest question, though. Can Geekie improve his skating enough in order to be effective at the NHL level? Or a better question might be this: How will Geekie adapt and change his game once the competition gets bigger, faster, and stronger? He isn't going to be able to run over the competition for much longer, and his effort level sure as hell won't cut it in the pros.

There are times when I'm enamored with Geekie's skill level. He thinks the game ahead of players and creates a lot of high danger chances. When he's on his game, Geekie looks like a legitimate top ten pick. When he's off his game, however, Geekie looks like a player that I'd avoid entirely if I were drafting in the top 20. Yes, the size and skill combination will be enticing for an NHL team, but the risks in his game make me wary of his odds at making a big splash in the NHL.

If I'm being honest, I haven't liked Geekie very much this season. I see the skill that others are seeing, and it's easy to look at his highlights and go “man, this kid has it.” But when I've watched Geekie play, I've seen an underwhelming player with very obvious flaws in his game that will affect his NHL chances. The skating is an obvious issue, but his effort level in the neutral and defensive zones concerns me even more. Again, I don't want to call Geekie a lazy player, but his efforts in the defensive zone can definitely look lazy at times. Then there's the issue of whether or not Geekie is an NHL center moving forward. It's a major concern of mine that Geekie is not dictating the play when he's on the ice. He doesn't even carry the puck into the zone. I see him waiting for the play to come to him instead of actively seeking opportunities, making me question if he can be more than just a complementary player at the NHL level.

If I were an NHL team with a top 20 pick, I would hesitate to draft Geekie. It's easy to be enamored with the size and skill, but under the surface, you have a player that's going to take a long time to get to a top six role at the NHL level. Geekie could easily peak as a third line player in the NHL, which, in this scout's opinion, is not worth a top 20 pick. Again, the upside is there, but there are a lot of holes in Geekie's game that could limit his effectiveness at the NHL level.","Poor skating is the biggest thing holding Geekie back from being one of the top-tier talents in this draft. It's a big issue, but I think he makes up for it with his intelligence. Say what you want about his feet, but the puck is around him an awful lot. He puts himself in good positions, is aggressive enough to win puck battles and has the size to dominate in a lot of the tough areas of the ice. His hands are good enough to keep the opposition honest and he can drive the middle of the ice as well as anyone in this draft. I think Geekie could go higher than I have him here, but the skating continues to be my most fervent concern. That said, I still think all the other tools make him especially worthy of a first-round grade. ","A big, rangy pivot who can manipulate in tight spaces and sees the ice well. The footspeed and pace have long been documented as areas that need a lot of help, but Geekie's defensive positioning and stick make his floor nice and safe. There's a wide range of outcomes here.","There was a time this season when Conor Geekie looked like a contender to crack the top-five in this year's draft. He may still get there. It only takes one team, after all. But it's far from a foregone conclusion, and even the top-10 may be out of reach at this stage.
You can probably attribute some of that to the play of those who've passed him. There's been a lot of movement in his range, and I would describe his place on a shifting board more as other players rising rather than Geekie falling. Sure, he cooled off as the season went on, capping it off with a sub-point per game performance in the playoffs, but we'd hardly say that his game fell off. Not by any means.
The reality is that we came to view Geekie's projection as more of a two-way middle-six centre at the NHL level than a top-six power forward. For a group that covets upside, there just wasn't any way to justify placing him any higher on our board because of it.
Now, this isn't to suggest that the 6-foot-4 pivot is inept with the puck. There's some legitimate skill here, and it just may scale up to the NHL, too. Geekie's hands are easily the best part of his offensive toolkit, with technique, precision, speed, agility, and range as a handler. It's just not often that you see a 6-foot-4 skater pull off some of the handling moves that graced his draft year highlight-reel.
The problem is that the Strathclair-born pivot relies far too frequently on that skill, defaulting to a handling manoeuvre in the face of any defensive pressure. There's some small area passing skill there as well, but far too often, the move was to try and swashbuckle his way past problems. Only compounding matters is that so many of these dangles occur in a glide.
The more projectable component of Geekie's offensive profile is his playmaking, small area or otherwise. He has a knack for identifying passing options through layers and has the skill as a passer to connect, almost always with pace. It's not a high-end NHL projection, but it will be sufficient to put up points at a respectable clip in the big leagues all the same.
More than anything, though, we're drawn to the Ice centre's two-way game; his ability to play high-leverage minutes, kill penalties, and make life miserable for the opposition's best. He's a strong off-puck defender, who tracks well through the neutral zone and makes proactive reads in the defensive third. In close quarters defensive sequences, Geekie takes good lines on the puck, leads with his stick, closes with force, and doesn't give up on plays.
You bank on that defensive projection, and then you work from there with Geekie. In the right hands, with a development staff that adds an extra gear as a skater and more discretion as a handler, perhaps a top-six projection is within reach. For now, we see him as more of a high-end middle-six player at the NHL level.","Whether you are looking for him or not, it's impossible to not notice Conor Geekie when watching the Winnipeg Ice this season.  While teammate Matthew Savoie stands out for his offense and agility, Geekie stands out for his size.  At 6'4, Geekie towards over many of his peers and uses his size to his advantage.

Averaging over a point per game, Geekie has excellent puck skills for a big player.  He excelled on the powerplay last season and protects the puck well.  Geekie excels at drawing players to himself and then moving the puck to the open space he has just created.  He also has a decent shot, though he does project more as a playmaker at the NHL level.

The biggest question surrounding Geekie is his skating.  He can get around okay but lacks high-end speed and his acceleration needs work.  If he can improve even a little bit in this area, Geekie should settle in as a middle-six forward with offensive upside at the NHL level.  He is likely 2-3 years away from NHL duty.","Connor Geekie is a center who's combination of size and elite puck skills are unlike any other available in this year's class. He's a puck possession monster that causes major headaches for those trying to defend him. He uses his frame extremely well to shield the puck from others and create time and space. He has so many tools to use offensively – it's almost unfair to opponents when he has the puck. He can use his size to drive the puck to the net, has surprisingly soft hands for a guy his size, and is able to stickhandle his way through defenders. He also possesses a lethal wrister. It's a heavy heavy shot but his release is deceptive and seems effortless. Another area he excels at is his play off the rush. He's a threat with the puck, but even without it he drives lanes with a purpose of either getting himself in a better scoring position or to occupy a defender and create more ice. Even though he has all of these amazing offensive skills, there are two things that may hold him back from reaching his full potential. He doesn't have great acceleration, and his top speed isn't very high. He can just seem slow in general. It raises questions as to how effective he can be in a modern NHL that is based on speed. His compete-level is questionable, too. He's fantastic when he has the puck but when he doesn't, he too often seems disengaged with the play. He doesn't show much urgency in his own zone to provide support for his defensemen, and he's not really one to be the first guy in on the forecheck. Put it all together and you get one of the most intriguing prospects. If Geekie is able to work on his skating and better his 200-foot game, the team that picks him may have snagged a top-six center with huge offensive upside."
2022,LW,69.75,180,31,TBL,19,Isaac Howard,"Howard is a player defined by his skill level. His stick skills are among the best in the draft. He can make quick and creative dekes consistently. He's known as a goal-scorer, but he can make creative passes and make difficult plays in small areas. Howard is a good enough skater for the NHL, but for a 5-foot-10 guy you'd like to see a little more burst. His goal scoring is more a product of his skill and willingness to attack the middle than an elite shot. He projects as a top-nine winger.","Howard's a top-10 talent who will likely be available into the teens and maybe even the 20s. And while I can typically see and understand why and where the consensus diverges from my view of a player, he's one that the more I watch, the less I understand the case against. Though he's “short,” he's a long way from small, with a muscular build that makes him sturdy on his feet. That stocky frame doesn't slow him down either. He's got some of the quicker crossover acceleration in the draft, with a hurried stride that cranks its way up ice to give him translatable speed. And after arriving at the program as an all-offence player, his effort level and tenaciousness really became hallmarks of his game, further muting any (misplaced) size concerns that might exist.

He's one of the more dangerous players in the draft with the puck and yet he's even more dangerous off of it, with a scorer's sixth sense for always arriving just on time in Grade-A locations (whether that's hiding in coverage or just staying around the puck at the net). He makes a lot of plays under the triangles of defenders' sticks, he navigates in and out of holes in traffic like few others in this class in possession, and when he's in attack mode taking pucks from a standstill into the middle of the ice to create looks, he's a ton of fun to watch and forces opposing players to reach in on him (which draws a lot of penalties).

He's creative. He tries things (occasionally at the offensive zone blue line that he shouldn't but gets away with) and usually executes. I'm a big believer in Howard. He's lethal in the home-plate area and has some of the better hands and instincts in the draft. He's always going to have PP utility but he's also impactful enough offensively at five-on-five to warrant a top-six projection, even if he doesn't have the premiums of size or position.","Howard has a lot of the fundamentals that I love and cherish. His speed is excellent and he can play a high-tempo competitive game, especially behind the red line and the corners. In addition, he does a great job of finding open ice in the slot and keeps himself well aligned with puck movement.

Over the next few years at the University of Minnesota-Duluth, I would like to see Howard continue to grow his transitional game and work on identifying optimal passing lanes to exploit. But, I do love his ability to generate passes to high danger. At the same time, I just want to see the number of completed dangerous passes go up. So, if he can work on identifying the optimal lanes to use, you have to imagine that the dangerous passing rates will go up. In addition, I'd like to see bolster his shot mechanics.

If Howard continues to develop his game nicely, I do believe that you are looking at a top nine forward at the NHL level.","With some of the best hands in the draft, Howard lacks size, but he does not lack entertainment value. His feet and hands are quick and deceptive all at the same time, which makes him tougher to defend. Howard led the NTDP in scoring this season with 82 points in 60 games. His hockey sense is advanced as he has some of the best timing in this draft. He always seems to get himself into dangerous positions and convert. He's a bit of a light 5-foot-10, and he doesn't have the same consistency of competitiveness of some of the other forwards, but you can't take your eyes off him when he's at the top of his game. Defensively, he's going to need some work, but he's headed to the University of Minnesota Duluth where two-way play is a requirement for expanded ice time. He's in a good spot developmentally and while he needs to get stronger, the upside his skill alludes to is pretty substantial.",Another player with great skating and handling combination but lacking some of the decision-making qualities you want to see from a potential creator. Howard meshed well with Nazar all season so you know he can play with high-end talent.,"It took our team a few months to appreciate Isaac Howard's game. The USNTDP winger didn't make our top-32 board at our first meeting. He was also absent of our top-64 board in January. An honorable mention was the only indication at that point that we considered him a top two round pros-pect. But then, after his strong end of the season and World Championship Under-18, we came to see a clearer NHL path for Howard. 
His tools were never in doubt, especially his skating and shooting, which both received significantly above-average projections. A couple of times per game this season, Howard sprinted outside of the defensive zone, received the puck in flight, and beat the line of defence to take on the goalie one-on-one. And the winger got even more scoring chances by sneaking past defenders inside pockets of space in the slot. A well-placed pass from Frank Nazar was all that it took for Howard to earn another goal. 
The winger can fire off passes better than almost anyone else in the draft. His ability to control his feet and weight to load all sorts of releases quickly, one-timers and wrist-shots, allowed him to beat a lot of goalies before they even had time to move.
As a playmaker, Howard is hopeful more than creative. He sent many pucks into areas of the ice this season without checking if his teammates were there on the receiving end, a tendency that lead to turnovers. Contrary to his team-mates, Logan Cooley or Nazar, Howard only rarely showed an ability to manipulate defenders out of lanes. Because of the inefficiency and predictability of his play, he required a high volume of puck touches to manufacture occasions for his teammates.
Howard's game should translate easily to the NCAA, but at the professional level, he won't be able to fly the zone on breakouts to catch defenders off guard. He will have to be-come more aware and learn to manage the puck much better. The most projectable aspect of his game, for us, is his play without the puck, his ability to attack pockets of space and instantly fire inside them. If Howard improves his defence and overall playmaking efficiency, he could earn a career as a second-line scorer. 
“His projection comes down to tools. He's a projectable shooter, capable of firing off the pass or in motion,” wrote , Elite Prospects Director of North American scouting, on March 27th, 2022  “Takes passes across the body, using the momentum of the pass to load his weight for the shot. Hands in front, elbow up – the puck explodes off his stick. I don't see the dynamic skill that I was expecting coming into the season, and decision-making remains concerning, but his tools would make him a solid mid-to-late second.”  ","Howard is higher on my list than others, but there is a reason for that.  The top scorer for the U.S. NTDP, Howard has some of the best hands in the draft.  He is incredibly quick and agile with the puck on his stick.

Howard also has high-end offensive instincts and timing in the offensive zone.  He is a creative and fun player to watch.  He has the skills to drive play and run a powerplay.  

The biggest question regarding Howard is his size or lack thereof.  Some scouts have concerns that Howard won't be able to deal with bigger and stronger players at the NHL level.  I, for one, believe that Howard's skill set is more than enough to compensate for his lack of size.  He will need some development time, but projects as a top-six forward who is 2-3 years away from NHL duty.","Isaac Howard is a high-end offensive creator whose hallmark appears to be his playmaking and ability to facilitate his team's offensive attack. He is a strong skater and has a bit of an edge, allowing him to be effective in 50/50 battles and creating opportunities out of the cycle because he isn't afraid to go into the high-traffic areas with the puck. He has a quality shot, and shows strong patience with the puck on his stick. Whether it be out of the cycle, or off the rush, he spots a lane he wants to attack and has the ability and confidence to attack that lane and create a quality chance for himself or a teammate. Confidence is never an issue with him, as he thinks he's the best player whenever he's on the ice and oftentimes his ability can back that notion up. In other words, he has a swagger to his game. When you examine him closely, there are two areas that may bring you some pause about him as a prospect. Those areas are his consistency and tendency to force a play rather than taking what the defense gives him. As he progresses closer to the professional ranks, he will need to get better at risk-management, and learn to take the easy play rather than forcing something that isn't there – otherwise NHL defenders will eat him up and cause him to turn the puck over at a high-rate. The other thing is his consistency. When he is on, he's arguably the best player on the ice. As he develops and matures he will have to learn to play at the same level on a nightly basis, otherwise his ceiling at the NHL level could be limited. Howard can be a top-six winger at the NHL level if he can level out the up-and-down swings, but because of his consistency issue he may end up being more of a complimentary middle-six player."
2022,C,70,164,16,BUF,20,Noah Ostlund,"Ostlund possesses impressive speed and skill. He's able to be an asset in transition due to his ability to create controlled entries and make defenders miss. He has a pass-first mentality but can make difficult plays at a high rate. Ostlund has the poise to run a power-play unit and find seams but he's not much of a shot threat. Ostlund isn't the biggest, but he works hard enough and has shown as a junior he can be reliable defensively. He looks like a bottom-six center in the NHL.","Ostlund's calling card is his airy, agile skating stride, excellent hands, cleverness, and two-way ability. The skating and defensive aptitude (including on faceoffs) make him an able penalty killer and the rest give him clear tools of creation at five-on-five and on the power play. He wins a ton of short races, creates quickly as soon as he's in possession, and darts around the ice in control to get into scoring areas or facilitate from the perimeter. His lack of size and strength are definitely going to be impediments as he progresses up levels, but he's got the benefit of time, his skating, and the fondness coaches have for him to fall back on.

He's silky smooth in possession (grades out at the very top of the draft in that regard), which makes him one of the very best puck transporters through neutral ice in the draft. There's some risk that comes with selecting him but he's got a slippery quality that few players in this range have, the puck just sticks to him in tight coverage, and he is a catalyst on his line in a variety of ways. He's a nifty little player. Some scouts worry about whether he'll be able to get to the inside/hold his own physically along the wall against pros (he didn't score a ton even against his peers this year, given his talent level and linemates) but his approach and skating should help mitigate against that. I like him a lot.

Ostlund's got two years left on his contract with Djurgården, but the second year has an out built in if they aren't promoted back to the SHL from HockeyAllsvenskan.","There is a lot to like about Ostlund. His speed, playmaking and mobility makes him dangerous. Even when he doesn't have the speed to get around attackers when defending, he has still found ways to cause plenty of disruption and kill rush attempts. But, the one area that I love is how deceptive he can be with his playmaking ability and his ability to make use of extremely tight passing lanes. He has a hunger for the puck and knows that he needs to get the puck to high danger areas to win. I'm confident that he will be a top six forward at the NHL level and the path to get there isn't a very long one for Ostlund given his skill-set. ","A committed center with some dynamic elements in his skill, Ostlund put up big numbers in the Swedish U20 ranks, but he couldn't quite find a way to make an impact at the pro level this season. Then he went off for 10 points at the World U18s and was essentially playing every third shift at center over the course of that tournament. He is competitive in all zones, but he shines most in his ability to find teammates and make those around him better. He may have to move away from the middle down the road, but I think he plays the position well. He's an adequate skater, but he plays a little bit lighter and has a lot of strength he needs to tack on to be effective at the next level. His last impression was a strong one and I thought the best example of what Ostlund can ultimately be if he can get a bit stronger.","Ostlund is something of a skillful artist. He can make highly clever and difficult plays looks easy and almost whimsical. Owns strong vision, a soft touch and an elite mind for play creation. The size coupled with less-than-electric skating is the trouble.  I do like to bet on skill and smarts though.","The third and final member of the well-renowned Djurgårdens trio, Noah Ostlund presented the most challenging evaluation of the lot. We started the year with the skilled centre in the middle of our first round, right there with Liam Ohgren in the teens, but that endorsement became more difficult to stand by as the season wore on.
At his best, Ostlund is a dynamic, shifty playmaker who takes full advantage of the width of the ice to build passing sequences. A dextrous distributor with the full array of reach-adjusted passes and the keen eye to find options through traffic, he was the most prolific setup-man in the entire Swedish junior circuit.
""Ostlund is undoubtedly the sharpest player on Sweden's U18 roster and likely rates among the top-five in this draft for hockey sense period,"" Elite Prospects Swedish regional scout Jimmy Hamrin wrote in a pre-U18s profile of Ostlund. ""He is the glue that holds his teams together. He plays with strong puck support, drives play, and has a high motor.""
The play-driving element that Hamrin cited is most evident in the way Ostlund transports the puck up-ice as a transition piece. His constant support in the defensive zone allows him to link defence to offence, often as the main conduit for his team between the blue lines.
Far from a straight-line attacker, Ostlund uses his cunning to create entries, changing speeds and lanes to keep defenders off-balance. Once the defenceman opposite him has committed his feet, the Swedish centre violently shifts his weight in the opposite direction and explodes past them to gain the offensive zone.
""Dynamic: This is how one could best describe Ostlund,"" Elite Prospects lead scout  wrote of Ostlund's work at the 2022 U18 World Hockey Championship. ""The centre was flying all over the ice and taking control of Sweden's play for most of his shift. He was supporting breakouts by timing himself into pockets of space to offer passing options to his defenceman and moving the puck out of the zone quickly.
""He showed abilities off the rush, like dangles to beat opponents and in-stride releases, and in the offensive zone, like elusive skating cuts along the walls.""
Where problems arise with Ostlund's projection is in the way that he handles contact. He often struggled to sustain even the tamest physical play at the SHL level last season, spending entire games stapled to the perimeter of the offensive zone. It's kind of hard to score from there.
The absence of a wall game, concerns about his pace, and the lack of any finishing skill all conspired to keep Ostlund further down our board than many of our peers in the public sphere, but there's enough there elsewhere that we can certainly understand their enthusiasm.
Ostlund's combination of speed, handling skill, playmaking, and defensive instincts could augur great things at the next level, but he'll need to gain a little muscle and a lot of courage with the puck to take full advantage of his skill set.","Ostlund is a creative playmaking center that had an up and down season in Sweden.  Ostlund played in both the SWEHL and for his club's junior team.  While he excelled offensively for the junior squad, Ostlund struggled to keep up in the SWEHL.  

Ostlund boasts a high skill level and he is creative with the puck.  He finds ways to find open teammates and makes difficult passes look easy.  Ostlund anticipates the play well in the offensive zone and has quick hands.  Unfortunately, consistency was an issue last season.  He would disappear for long periods of time and struggle with his play away from the puck at times.  

In order for Ostlund to compete for a middle-six NHL role, he will need to get stronger and work on consistent effort game-in and game-out.  If everything comes together, Ostlund should compete for an NHL spot in 3-4 years.","Noah Ostlund is an undersized center with potential to be one of the top offensive catalysts in the NHL Draft. He primarily makes his money in the offensive zone, using a variety of tools. For one, he processes the game at an immensely high level, allowing him to succeed as both a puck-carrier and passer. Even with opponents on his heels, he remains calm and collected, and can either use his elusiveness or vision to transport the puck. His shiftiness and quick edges allow him to separate from opponents and carry the puck, making up for his smaller frame. With space, he is a pass-first player who can hit the tape of a teammate's sticks quickly. Both the youngster's quickness and passing allow him to transition his team to the offensive zone efficiently. His shot is far from top notch, but he does possess a solid release that can fool netminders or allow for rebounds. In the defensive zone, he is a capable middle-man. He positions well, backchecks, and can use his stick and body to interfere with passing and shooting lanes. As expected, his main defensive flaw is his lacklustre size. He rarely outmuscles opponents, and he can be easily outworked on 50/50 puck battles. He is too easily shielded from the puck by opposing skaters, too. Adding strength is an absolute necessity for him. In order to remain a center at the next level, he must develop physically, which should happen with time. He is an exciting prospect for the NHL Draft. His ability to process the game quickly and make great decisions in the offensive zone is among the best in this class. With more physical development in terms of his muscle mass, Ostlund should be a middle-six forward with high offensive and power play upside."
2022,LW,73,185,20,WSH,21,Ivan Miroshnichenko,"Miroshnichenko is a player with all the attributes you want in a top NHL winger. He's got good size and strength. He's a strong skater. He's highly skilled. He can make plays and he's highly competitive. His shot is a bullet and can be a weapon from the flank on a pro power play. He can beat defenders with speed, he can put pucks through legs, he can create at even strength and on the power play. He has a bulky frame and can play a powerful style of game. He has the tools and track record of a projected top line winger, but given his diagnosis he is being placed several tiers below that due to the significant uncertainty in his future projection — despite positive developments since the initial diagnosis.","Miroshnichenko is the hardest player in this year's draft class to rank because of his health following a Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosis in early 2022. The latest update is that he has completed his treatment in Germany and has been cleared to resume training under a full load in Russia, so that's a big positive. Teams are all having the same conversations about where their threshold would be in the draft to take him. I've settled here, after the core group of 27 players that I believe strongest in. For context, Miroshnichenko was widely regarded as Russia's best prospect in this draft before the diagnosis, even after a so-so start to his season had pushed him from the top three conversation into more of a top-10 projection (before I learned of the diagnosis, he slotted 11th on my list, which was a smidge lower than most).

As a player, Miroshnichenko has an illustrious international track record as a captain and first-line player in his age group (often alongside 2023 sensation Matvei Michkov) and a good though less inspiring domestic track record.

There are some exciting attributes to his game and it's well rounded, so it's never been hard to understand the appeal. He's got an athletic pro frame. He shoots it hard (both his wrister and his one-timer/off one-touch shots) from mid range, giving him clear power-play upside. He's a powerful skater through his edges and crossovers. He's got good playmaking instincts. He's a dexterous player who catches bad passes, manages to keep control when the play breaks down or the ice is choppy, and gets his stick on tips, etc. And he's noticeably engaged shift to shift without the puck. My big hiccup with him is that I don't find him to be a great problem-solver. While he can make the first play he sees on instinct, he doesn't do a good job breaking down the play to think it through. No matter where he lands on draft day, it'll be a testament to his status as a prospect and the pro style that he played before the diagnosis. Worth noting: Though he's ranked 28th here, not all of the players I have in front of him will be drafted in the first round, which means I probably wouldn't be prepared to take the gamble on Miroshnichenko until somewhere in the middle of the second round when the above players are gone.","The projection for Miroshnichenko might change throughout the season. But, at first glance, I believe you are looking at a second line forward. If he can work on his shot, he has the potential to be lethal at the NHL level. But, I truly believe that his shot will hold him back if further development does not occur.","If not for a Hodgkins lymphoma diagnosis earlier this year, we could be talking about Miroshnichenko as a top-10 pick in this class. Reports suggest that his prognosis is positive and that Miroshnichenko will be able to resume his career as early as next season. Still, it's a factor in his projection and there's a lot of risk. The potential for reward, however, is extraordinarily high, especially if a team can land him later in the first round. Miroshnichenko is a powerful, fast player who is difficult to defend as he uses his strength to gain an advantage on the opposition. He has quick hands and a deadly shot that he can let go from anywhere, but it's his propensity for driving the middle that makes me believe he's going to be a talented scorer at the NHL level. He attempted to follow the same exact path as Andrei Svechnikov by coming to North America at 16, playing in the USHL and then probably going to the OHL, but a visa issue prevented him from coming to play for the Muskegon Lumberjacks two years ago. Miroshnichenko is under KHL contract for two more seasons, but he burns to play in the NHL.","A jackhammer of a forward. Skates fast. Shoots hard. Hits harder. The health is concerning. The stagnation from his draft-minus-one is concerning. And sadly, the passport is likely concerning for some teams as well. Miroshnichenko could end up as a very useful piece all over the lineup if things break right.","On pure talent alone, we've probably placed Ivan Miroshnichenko a solid 10-plus spots lower on our board than he belongs. The Russian factor, more complicated than ever this year, and a Hodgkin's Lymphoma diagnosis have made his evaluation incredibly fraught, though.
The good news, as of this writing, is that Miroshnichenko is believed to have cleared treatment and is already training in preparation for next season. Here's hoping that holds true and that the Omsk product can continue his playing career and live a healthy, fulfilling life free from the grips of this malady. Ultimately, his health comes first.
Getting back to the hockey side of things, Miroshnichenko is one of this draft's more obviously physically gifted players. All of his tools check out as an average-to-above-average projection if not better, and his release is among the best in this class. He's one of the draft's credible finishers from a range, a sniper with an evident separating skill around which he can build an NHL identity.
Everything you look for to project an elite finisher to the NHL level is there in Miroshnichenko's game: shot volume, the variety of releases, and the use of screens and traffic to increase the odds. His one-timer is a legitimate cannon, one that made him the centrepiece of Omskie Krylia's power play in the VHL last season.
""On the power play, he shows more patience, more foresight, waiting for lanes to open, keeping himself deceptive until teammates get in position,"" Elite Prospects lead scout  wrote in an early-season game report. ""He didn't score in this game, but I liked his shot mechanics. Good knee-bend and follow through. The releases looked hard and well-aimed. He looks like a one-timer threat.""
Read between the lines, and you may notice how careful we are to qualify his best off-puck work as occurring on the power play. That's not by accident. Miroshnichenko's play at even strength consistently left our team wanting, particularly early in the year.
""Really bad movement off the puck and was constantly trailing the rush,"" Elite Prospects regional scout Dylan Griffing wrote of Miroshnichenko in an October game report. ""[He] took himself completely out of the play by sitting on his team's blue line while his two linemates were on their way into the offensive zone. Shot selection was weak, just started shooting from anywhere and everywhere in the late stages of the game.""
His off-puck diligence improved as the season wore on, to the point where it almost rated as a strength for our staff in later viewings. So, credit where it's due on that front, even if getting there took far more time than it should have for a player with his reputation and pedigree.
There's more to Miroshnichenko than just his shot, though. He's a naturally skilled puckhandler, and his forward stride rates as above average even if the mechanical form isn't exactly what you'd call textbook. When his motor is running at top gear (not always a given), there's also a physical side to his game that bears mentioning; he punched way above his stocky 6-foot-1, 185-pound frame against men in the VHL last season. The central conceit of Miroschnichenko's game is that he's a hammer and that he views everything and everyone on the ice as a nail -- pucks and opponents alike. It's also the reason that we've been a bit cool on his game relative to many of our peers in the scouting community. He's more than just a shot, but not that much more, and it's not like we consistently saw the off-puck savvy from Miroshnichenko that's baked into the game of every one of the NHL's best finishers.
It's not impossible to imagine a scenario where Miroshnichenko rounds out his game and develops into a top-line sniper at the NHL level, but we envision a more modest future for the Russian winger a bit further down the lineup.","An exceptionally hard player to evaluate, Miroshnichenko had an up and down season.  He was also diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma, a type of cancer, that sidelined him for a large portion of the season.  When the year began, Miroshnichenko was a top-five pick on most public lists.  His combination of size, skill, and offensive ability appeared to make him a bonafide top 10 pick.  

However, before the diagnosis, Miroshnichenko struggled to put up points in Russia.  This doesn't mean he doesn't have the tools to succeed, however.  Similar to Yurov, Miroshnichenko has a well-rounded offensive game.  He is a powerful skater with the puck on his stick and loves to tee up for one-timers.  He has an excellent release and isn't afraid to enter into tough areas on the ice.

There are continuing questions surrounding Miroshnichenko's health, as well as questions regarding his status playing in Russia next season.  He has tried to play in North America in the past, and perhaps there's a path forward this season, which could help his draft stock somewhat.  If everything comes together, Miroschnichenko is a potential top-six forward at the NHL level.  He is likely 3-4 years away.","Ivan Miroshnichenko, who was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in March, is a goal-scoring winger who excels at shot generation and owns one of the draft's best shots. He has long been considered one of the top scoring talents due to his advanced ability as a shooter and his ability to get open in soft areas of ice to make himself available to teammates. He owns a quick and deceptive release on his wrist shot, and he's able to shoot in stride and shoot off both feet with power and accuracy to beat netminders from range. He also owns a great one-timer, able to generate tremendous torque on the shaft of his stick get the puck on goal with power. It makes him a major weapon on the power play when set up in the circle on his off-wing. He also displays puck skills as a plus attribute, particularly when it comes to his hand-eye coordination. He's able to corral off-target passes in his feet or away from his body, which increases his threat as a scorer as it does not take a perfect pass to set him up in a high-danger scoring area. He is also a plus skater, able to move north-south well with good speed and acceleration that allows him to attack in transition. He's also a regularly engaged player and is able to fight through checks, showing good strength with the puck on his stick. Where he will need to find improvement in order to become a top-flight producer at the pro level is an added level to his creativity with the puck on his stick. He's capable of delivering passes to teammates and has reliable instincts, but struggles to break down well-positioned defenses. Miroshnichenko is a well-rounded forward with the tools to be a high-end top-six scorer, and will need to improve creativity to reach that."
2022,C,71.25,178,28,BUF,22,Jiri Kulich,"Kulich is a well-rounded prospect. He has a fluid, powerful skating stride that can generate clean entries and beat defenders wide. He has slick 1v1 skills and combined with his speed is a threat off the rush. He can make plays but is more of a threat when he's in motion than picking apart defenses as a playmaker. Kulich has a great shot, showing a one-timer and wrist shot threat from range. Kulich doesn't show fear from attacking the net or taking a hit to make a play. He projects as a top-nine forward, whether at wing or center with the potential to play higher in a lineup.","Kulich's MVP performance at U18 worlds answered (emphatically) questions about whether he was a first- or second-rounder, impressing scouts with his like-clockwork one-timer on the power play. Kulich is a sturdy, driven player who can morph his game to his role and function as the detail-oriented, above-puck defender who makes quick plays and stays on pucks, can play off of talented linemates to free his dangerous shooting arsenal up, or can carry the puck and function as the primary handler on a line. I like his positioning off the puck. I like his the balance and control of his skating stride. I like how quickly and hard shots come off of his stick (not just with his one-timer but through a deceptive early release point). He's got quick hands and flashes skill one-on-one. He's got good feel around the net. He plays hard. He can play all three forward positions. There's a lot to like about his makeup.","Honestly, the sky is the limit with Kulich. If he can become a far stronger skater and acquire a power stride, he can be even more dangerous. But, his ability to create ice for himself in all three zones makes him a true intriguing prospect at the draft. I could see second line upside as a center in the NHL or he could be deployed as a winger with an excellent playmaker on the top line. It just depends on how his development goes.","Owner of one of this draft's best one-timers, Kulich rode that big shot to nine goals and MVP honors at the U18 World Championship this spring. It was a nice exclamation point on a season that saw Kulich steadily rise up boards and make a more compelling case for himself to go in the first round. He's average sized but strong on his skates and anticipates especially well. There's power in the way he plays, with a good skating stride and strength down low. He has a higher-end compete level, too, so he doesn't overly rely on his skill to create for himself. There are few players more dangerous when he gets himself open for the shot. It's off his stick so quickly and violently that goalies are reacting after the puck is already past them.","Kulich popped in a big way at the U18s to wrap up his season. Plus speed, shot, and hands drive his game. Can get a little shy when entering the middle of the ice though.","The scouting community's expectations couldn't have been much higher for Jiří Kulich coming into the year. A draft-minus-one season with some time spent in the Czech profes-sional circuit, a strong showing at the U17s, and a roster spot at the U18s in Texas had him planted firmly on our radar.
It took Kulich some time to find his game and live up to the hype, though. He started the scouting season off with a just-okay showing at the Hlinka-Gretzky Cup, and he didn't exactly look like much of a difference-maker in his first few months of Extraliga tape, even if the points were coming at a high-end clip.
Mostly, we saw someone who projected as a bottom-six support player at the NHL level when we watched Kulich. There was a pressure game built on strong forechecking, diligent backchecking, and a motor that never stopped running, but little in the way of separating skill that would augur high-end production in the big leagues.
""Kulich's non-stop scanning and situational awareness during the game was just amazing, and the fact that he was so responsible and effective defensively against such skilled Canadien players definitely increases his value,"" Elite Pros-pects Czechia and Slovakia regional scout Marek Novotny wrote in a game report from the World Juniors. ""He didn't give opponents much time to make a decision."" If anything, Kulich's interior-driven, contact-seeking style seemed best suited to picking up the occasional goal at the net-front, sending home rebounds and loose pucks from just outside the blue paint.
By about mid-December, though, there were signs that the Czech forward was starting to hit his groove; signs that he may yet live up to his first-round billing coming into the year.
Perhaps most encouraging of all was the development of an off-puck game as a shooter. Kulich was starting to find soft ice away from the play and create chances to leverage his high-end shot to greater effect rather than standing at the net-front and hoping for deflections.
By the time the U18s rolled around, Kulich had perfected the art. And by the time the U18s had finished, the Czech forward had used his cannon of a shot to score nine goals in six contests en route to tournament MVP honours.
With that performance fresh in the minds of most scouts and executives going into this July's draft, don't be surprised to see Kulich go in the first 15 picks. There's always a mar-ket for hard skill, and this Czech forward brings that to the table in bunches.
Kulich's physical makeup, finishing ability, motor, and speed as a skater make him one of the easier prospects to project to the NHL, perhaps even in a high-end, middle-six scoring winger's role. Then again, maybe some teams see him as a centre at the next level. That would only help his stock.","Kulich is a player that could be taken anywhere in the first round of the draft.  This is a testament to his well-rounded skill set and versatility.  Kulich can play center or wing.  More of a goal-scorer than a playmaker, he creates space for himself well with his skating and has excellent hands and excels in one-on-one situations.  He excels in making plays off the rush.

Kulich's well-rounded, versatile nature makes him a coveted prospect.  There are some questions regarding his ceiling and whether or not he will develop into a second line scoring type.  Regardless, he is a rather “safe” pick for whatever team drafts him.  He projects as a middle-six forward and is 2-3 years away from NHL duty.","Jiri Kulich is a goal-scoring winger who relies heavily on his off puck movement and elite-level shot to make have an impact on the game. His shot is by far his best asset, possessing a ton of power and accuracy in his shooting ability. He combines it with a lightning-quick release that he can get off from any angle and from a variety of puck placements. His offensive zone IQ and ability to find the soft spots in the defensive zone coverage make him an even more lethal option for his team. He rarely remains stagnant in the offensive zone, making it tough for his opponents to shadow him and eliminate him out of the play. Primarily, he works as an off-the-puck player but he is a capable puck-carrier as well, using his above-average puck skills and mobility to carve through the neutral zone and generate chances for himself or teammates off the rush. There are times where he moves too quickly and tries to do too much with the puck. If he can learn to slow down and think for an extra moment it will allow him to read the developing play much easier and result in fewer turnovers or ill-advised passes. Another thing he will want to do is add some strength to his game so he can fight through contact and get the puck to the high-danger areas more frequently. He has the potential to be a top-six scoring winger, and his shooting ability and offensive instincts will allow him to compliment a play-driving center quite well. His skillset will thrive if a team gives him the opportunity to be a trigger man on a power play unit. With his shot and offensive IQ, getting Kulich extra time and space will do his game a lot of good, especially as a confidence-builder early in his career. He's one of the draft's foremost snipers."
2022,RW,73,204,14,WPG,23,Rutger McGroarty,"McGroarty is a highly-skilled winger who is a threat inside the offensive zone because of his very good puck skills, shot and vision. He can make a lot of plays with finesse, but also is highly competitive. He forces a lot of turnovers, wins a good number of battles and can create around the hard areas of the offensive zone. The knock on McGroarty historically has been his skating. He has an awkward stride that lacks ideal balance and mechanics, but he has enough quickness to be able to play in the NHL. He projects as a top-nine winger with the potential to play higher in a lineup.","McGroarty's one of those kids who just looks like a pro hockey player. If he walked into an NHL dressing room tomorrow, he would stand stronger and broader than most in it. Then you add in the charisma which made him the natural choice for the captaincy at the program, and the light and energy that oozes out of him, and you have to be careful not to put too much stock into the off-ice pieces of the puzzle that he already appears to have figured out. But I think he's a darn good hockey player too and the pieces of the puzzle fit together nicely on the ice.

He's a better skater (there are some kinks he still needs to work out in his mechanics from a standstill because it doesn't look the prettiest through his first few steps, but there's some power when he gets going nonetheless) than he gets credit for and his spatial awareness and effort level help him avoid losing short races. He's got raw skill that shows up in his great hands. His finishing touch around the net is there in spades, with a hard one-touch shot that he leverages his strong frame to power through from a low kick.

He has particularly mastered the net drive into a high rotation away from coverage that brings him back to around the net. And then when he gets there, he's got the strength to shoot from bad postures/off balance. He always put his shots into good locations (along the ice, low blocker, high short side) it seems, too. He's dexterous. I'm a big fan. The ice normally tilts in his favour out there. He just understands where to be out there and how to put himself in positions to create offence. And he's got an impressive statistical profile, the kind that typically projects into a college scorer and beyond. If he can get a little quicker from the jump, he's got all of the other makings of a legitimate top-nine forward who can play up and down a lineup with a variety of player types.","Overall, Rutger McGroarty is going to make whichever team that selects him quite happy in the seasons to come. In McGroarty, they're getting a dynamic offensive player, who has proven at the U18 level he's incredibly difficult to defend against and can be extremely deceiving when in possession of the puck. His defensive game is up to snuff as well, as he is counted upon to kill penalties and assist his defensemen when hemmed deep in their zone.
McGroarty can do it all on the ice, while bringing a sense of fear and hesitation into his opponent's game. His draft stock has improved since the beginning of the year, and especially after winning MVP in the Biosteel All-American Game for Team Blue, with a goal and an assist as mentioned above.

You can find Rutger McGroarty's name scattered amongst boards ranging anywhere from just outside the top-10, to the tail end of the first round. However, I have a sense he will be selected anywhere between 15-25th overall at this summer's Entry Draft.","McGroarty has got the size, he's got the work ethic, the character and goal-scoring ability to be a long-term impact player. The main drawback in his game is his footspeed, which is definitely a concern among NHL sources. But it's hard to ignore the impact he makes on a game-to-game basis, whether it's with his physicality or his goal-scoring. He's not a towering player, but wins most of his battles in the hard areas of the ice. While he has an elite shot and can score from distance or off the one-timer, his net-front play is where he'll make his money in the NHL. He has good enough skill to finish plays with regularity and the hockey sense makes up for the concerns I see with his footspeed. ","This is a player who will make his living from the circles down. A power forward with a heavy and accurate release that can beat you a whole bunch of ways. Skating isn't pretty but McGroarty is determined and tenacious to pucks. If he can add a step, and you know he'll be working on it, there's top-six skill here. He's going to be a weapon on the man-advantage.","Rutger McGroarty's game checks a lot of boxes that you look for in a future NHL forward.
At the top of the list, there are his leadership qualities. The USNTDP rewarded his engagement on and off the ice by anointing him captain this season, a role that suited him perfectly. His teammates could draw inspiration from his style of play, specifically his ability to balance creativity and physicality. 
McGroarty is a fierce competitor along the boards. He fights through opposing sticks to win pucks, protect them, and move them to teammates. And he can do the same around the net. A lot of his goals this season came from rushing that area, specifically the far-post, as his teammates cycled the puck around the zone. When they freed themselves from pressure and turned toward the cage, McGroarty was there, ready for a tap-in.
There is a sense of timing and anticipation in McGroarty's net drives. 
“McGroarty does a lot of things really well but the most translatable and impressive is simply understanding where the play is going and how to situate himself best to maximize his chances,” Elite Prospects Dir. of Film scouting  wrote in an April game report. “He's clearly a highly intelligent player and this game was no different. He sat in coverage and then simply slid out to enter into a pocket when a pass could be made.”
His hockey sense also shows up in his playmaking, in his awareness of options all over the ice, and his ability to manipulate defenders; McGroarty can feint to open passing lanes and slip, hook, or saucer the puck inside them.
The forward's skating prevented him from joining other well-rounded USNTDP talents, like Logan Cooley and Frank Nazar, at the top of our board.
“McGroarty's skating remains the big question mark,” Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting  wrote in a March game report. “I'm confident that he has enough skill to overcome it. His physical game remains a strength, even with skating limitations. He can't out-leverage, so he outsmarts. He delays and waits for the pressure to lean on him, then spins away and relies on passing over individual skill in transition.” His hunched-over stride affects every aspect of his game, not only his speed and agility. It limits his ability to lean against opponents to cut toward the net, to dangle them off the rush (as he can't shift his weight smoothly enough to sell defenders on a fake), and to recover the puck after a mistake. McGroarty had no issue matching the pace of USHL opponents this season, but as he rises in level, his strength and motor might not be able to compensate for his inefficient stride mechanics. 
Most of our scouts are confident that, despite the below-average skating, McGroarty will find ways to create plays in the NHL in a middle-six role. His mobility limitations may have had a positive effect already; they forced him to adapt his game, to find workarounds, many of which will still serve him in the top league.","Another player with a fun name, the Lincoln, NB native had a solid season for the U.S. National Development Program.  McGroarty is known for his competitive nature and two-way play.  He is also known for his strong character, making him an ideal candidate for a future captain at the NHL level.  McGroarty rarely, if ever, takes a night off.  He is also a strong finisher and showed flashes of potential offensive brilliance throughout the season.  

Some questions surround whether or not McGroarty has a high enough offensive ceiling to be a first-round pick.  He does have the tools to put up some offense, but he may struggle to drive a line on his own at the next level.  Regardless of ceiling, McGroarty will likely play in the NHL.  I believe he will thrive as a middle-six forward.  He is likely 2-3 years away from competing for an NHL spot.","Rutger McGroarty is an underrated, highly competitive scorer. He has such a specific profile that many NHL teams will covet. He possesses elite offensive traits, including high-end scoring instincts that will translate well to the professional level, but it's his physical gifts that will set him apart from other prospects. An extremely competitive player, he isn't shy to engage in physical play and throw his body weight around at both ends of the ice. There are many solid attributes in his game, but his shooting ability is his bread and butter and is what will make him a nightmare to play against. He generates a ton of power off his quick release and unlike a lot of younger players, his accuracy is very well refined. While many will consider him a sniper, he is a capable facilitator who can spot passing lanes and take advantage when the defense gives him an opening. He's a multi-dimensional player who poses a threat both off the rush and out of the cycle down low. If there are any weaknesses in his game, it has to be his overall skating ability. He has decent speed when he gets to reach his full execution, but has a choppy stride that doesn't allow him to generate quick bursts of speed and push the pace as a puck-carrier. Normally bad skating would be a big red flag, but we know that it's easier to improve than it once was and the other facets of his game easily outweighs any risk his skating ability poses. No doubt, NHL scouts value goal-scoring, leadership, and high-effort levels, and certainly he brings all of that to the table. McGroarty's physical traits, hockey skills, and production are tough to ignore and he has the potential to be a top-six scoring forward for a decade-plus if he should hit his full potential."
2022,RW,69.5,174,26,MON,24,Filip Mesar,"Mesar's game is defined by speed and pace. He's one of the better skaters in this draft, with the ability to burn up the neutral zone to create clean entries with speed. He has good skill and playmaking ability, and shows he can make tough plays with the puck with pace. Mesar lacks size at 5-foot-10 and isn't an overly physical player. His compete is good enough for me but probably not where you want for an undersized player. I think with his speed, skill and scoring ability he can carve out a career as a top-nine winger though.","Mesar slipped a little on draft boards (in the public and private spheres) down the stretch and I wonder if it's an exposure thing. He played his final game of the year on April 2. So while the next two players on this list were helping their draft stock at U18 worlds, and the player after them was having a strong SHL playoff showing, Mesar wasn't front of mind for scouts.

He's an A-level skater (or close) who thrives with the puck on his stick, can play on the perimeter or knife to the inside, and can use space to feed pucks into it or take it to use his versatile and deceptive shot. He's also a highly involved player who works to use his speed to push tempo and chase down loose pucks. I've seen him make NHL skill plays on one shift and win a series of 50/50 battles to make something happen on the next. The fear is that he doesn't have a game-breaking offensive dimension (despite being highly skilled in a variety of areas), nor the size, to turn his enticing package into a high-end NHL player. But that's a common challenge for players in this range, I like the skill-skating combo, he processes the game at a high level, and he's got one of the stronger statistical profiles in the draft to support his case as a first rounder.

Of note: I know he's strongly considering making the move to the OHL next season. The Kitchener Rangers have his rights after selecting him with the ninth pick in the 2021 CHL Import Draft. I think that would be a prudent move for him if the NHL club that drafts him is on board.","Mešár has the potential to be a steal at the NHL Draft. His transitional play, skating/edges and his passing ability make him a constant threat. He is a well-rounded player and will continue to get stronger. The top six upside potential is there and while his production isn't high in Extraliga play, I'm confident that when Mešár is ready to make the next step and move to North America that the scoring will come. Just a matter of time. ","Mesar is so quick and shifty, which makes him exceptionally fun to watch. He has the skill level to make defenders miss 1-on-one 1 has a good enough shot to beat goalies clean from distance. The big issue with Mesar is that he's slightly below average in size and can be pushed off pucks a little easier at this point. Despite that, he does so many things well with the puck on his stick, you want to bet on his offensive upside. Mesar had decent numbers in the top pro league in Slovakia this year but shined internationally at various U18 events including his eight-point performance at the Hlinka-Gretzky Cup early this season. His speed and skill suggest he could one day round out into a top-six scorer, which is probably what he has to be to make it in the league as there's not a ton of value off the puck.","Speed and skill wrapped up in a smaller package and a bit shy to get to the inside. Mešár didn't dramatically improve any area throughout the season and paid for it with his draft stock. He's an electric talent, though, so if he can leverage those tools and become more inside-oriented, a team could have a Nik Ehlers-like transitional threat.","You've seen a lot of players like Filip Mešár come and go through the NHL Entry Draft if you've been paying attention to it for any amount of time. There's no denying their skill, but serious questions arise about how suited they are to bringing it with them to the NHL.
When you strike the jackpot with players like Mešár, the payoff is immense. You're looking at a top-six scoring winger with the skill to break open a game and be a focal point on a first unit power play. A lot of the time, though, you're left with not much of anything at all; a player whose only trace with your organization is a handful of games before they get lost on waivers or fly overseas.
The reasons for us to believe in the first outcome for Mešár are plenty, but they start with his pace and skating stride. This Slovakian winger just flies out there, weaving through traffic with a crossover-heavy stride, changing lanes and speeds to throw defencemen off balance, and exploding away from contact with forceful weight transfers. He's an absolute force between the blue lines and one of the draft's best transition forwards.
The next item on the list is Mešár's handling skill. The mechanical base is sound, with his hands operating inde-pendently of his feet, the puck in his hip pocket, and his top hand pushed out for the full range of motion. He dekes past opponents with quickness, precision, and agility. Simply put: Mešár's got moves.
Where things get a little ambiguous with the Poprad wing-er's game is whether or not his playmaking is a high-end skill. Every now and then, you'll see Mešár complete a highly difficult pass through traffic, even into space to set up his linemates for Grade-A scoring chances. Often, though, it's just an aimless hope pass that pans out against all reason; forced plays that have no business resulting in much of anything, save for a turnover.
Of course, the catch with Mešár, and I'm sure you saw this coming, is that he's a slight forward standing at just 5-foot-10 and spends far too much time on the peripheries of the offensive zone for our liking. He doesn't stand up to contact and can't gain the inside with the puck on his stick; even without the puck, it's all too easy for defenders to box him out from the net-front. He's the type of player opponents can dominate physically with a stern look.
The other thing is that Mešár's production more or less plateaued in the Tipos Extraliga last season at a solid-not-great 0.43 point per game clip. It's not like this high-risk, high-reward prospect is lighting the world on fire in the Slovakian professional circuit; he's third in total points among first-time draft-eligible skaters and second in points per game. Now, the additional context here is that Poprad was a bit of a mess last season -- they cycled through three head coaches by the time their campaign came to a close -- so make of that what you will. It all comes down to risk tolerance with this player. You could see a team swing for the fences here if they have more than one first-round pick, but the more likely outcome is that Mešár walks the stage at some point early in the proceedings on Day 2.","Mesar is a player whose stock rose as the season progressed, but some scouts still have some concerns regarding the small, skilled forward.  Mesar played in Slovakia's top league and didn't look out of place as a teenager.  That being said, he frequently shows flashes of offensive brilliance, but then disappears for large periods of time.

If Mesar finds another level of consistency in his game, he could find himself in a top-six role.  He's quick and has exceptional hands.  However, if he isn't able to put it all together, he may struggle to stick in an NHL line-up in a bottom-six role.

Mesar's skating alone makes him a solid NHL prospect.  He will likely be a late first-round pick.  Mesar projects as a middle-six forward and is likely 3-4 years away from NHL duty.","Filip Mesar is a highly intelligent, skilled forward who can positively impact the game at both ends of the ice. His ability to process the play and understand how to properly position himself in the offensive zone is a standout trait of his. He handles the puck extremely well, using his skating ability to drive the puck to the center lane with speed and get the puck to the high slot for a quality chance. A gifted shooter and passer, he has the ability to provide multiple threats, making him difficult for the opposition to defend against. He has the skill to make plays from both the high-danger areas and the perimeter, aided by the fact he can stickhandle in and out of traffic. Defending players always need to have their heads on a swivel when he is on the ice. For a skill guy, his defensive game is better than one would expect, using his awareness and mobility to quickly identify where his assignment is and effectively shadow them and negate any offensive chances they may have. He has the skillset to play multiple roles. With his high skill potential and skating ability he can also be an effective option on the power play. His defensive zone ability and quickness make him an effective penalty killer, and he has a solid impact at even-strength, too. He needs to mature physically before becoming a full-time NHLer, but the skills and work ethic are present, which will inevitably help. It won't be long before he's coming to North America and playing regular minutes in the league. His upside is sky high, and he could end up being a steal in the middle or later half of the first round. Mesar has the potential to be a top-six winger who plays a ton of minutes in multiple roles, and produces quality offensive numbers as a pro."
2022,RW,73.25,188,23,STL,25,Jimmy Snuggerud,"Snuggerud's a talented winger who can be dangerous with the puck on his stick. He has one-on-one skill, good vision, and his best asset is his shot. He is a long-range shooting threat with a one-timer you can build a power-play unit around. Snuggerud has good size, competes well and is responsible defensively. The only issue is he has heavy feet which could impede him as he advances levels. The rest of his game is strong enough though that I think he could be a top-nine forward.","Over the course of every season, I poll U.S. NTDP players for their most underrated teammate. When the answers are scattered, I tend not to read too much into them. But when they're close to unanimous, it's hard not to read into what they see in practices and the rest that we maybe haven't given enough shine to. This year, the answers were unflinching for two players: Snuggerud and Marek Hejduk. The latter is driven by his in-and-out-of-the-lineup year and the respect they all have for the way he handled it and the way he elevated everyone else with his work ethic. But Snuggerud, I know, is because they think he's a darn good player and he doesn't get the love he deserves playing on a line with Cooley and Gauthier, and a team that featured them plus Nazar, Howard and McGroarty up front.

Snuggerud is a well-rounded three-zone player with a versatile offensive game who works harder than anyone out there. His head is always up and on a swivel, even in congested areas. He's good below the goal line and makes a lot of low-to-high plays into the slot to find cutting teammates for chances. He sticks with the play and follows shots to the net to get to rebounds, playing a determined forechecking game.

He's got a dangerous one-timer and catch-and-release wrister but he doesn't tunnel vision for his shot, he sees the ice well, and he can make plays back against the grain. He's got good hands, which help him make outside-in plays to beat defenders one-on-one more than he gets credit for. He uses space well and makes a lot of plays off of his backhand. His skating is a work in progress but I know he's committed to it and spends a lot of time on it in the offseason. He's also got a pro frame to build upon and a June birthday that gives him good runway.","While many still believe that Jimmy Snuggerud will be a mid-late first round selection at the 2022 NHL Draft, he offers the sort of laser-beam shot and offensive skillset that teams tend to select quite high. His improvement on his 200ft game over the past couple of seasons has surely caught the eye of several NHL front offices. Perhaps a team with multiple selections in the first round (Columbus, Buffalo, Montreal) will look to take a shot with him, knowing they've secured their top pick already, and are looking for a prospect with a high ceiling they can have develop even further in the NCAA.

With much uncertainty surrounding a lot of prospects in the 2022 Class, it wouldn't come as a surprise to see a team take a swing on Snuggerud a little higher than most have him going. When the 2022 NHL Draft rolls around on July 7th and 8th in Montreal, look for Jimmy Snuggerud to come off the board somewhere between picks #15 and #32.","A down-low force with work ethic that doesn't relent, Snuggerud has often had to do the dirty work on his line. Despite that role, he is an especially dangerous scoring threat. Snuggerud has a great release and heavy shot that can surprise goalies. On top of that, he has the size and strength to get to the middle and make plays in tough areas. His skating is not amazing, which is a reason I don't have him higher on this list. I think Snuggerud is a well-rounded, committed player who makes those around him better and can create a lot of extra room for his linemates to operate. ","A bit of a jack-of-all type who really improved on his footwork between his draft-minus-one and draft year. Ended the season on the top line and earned that role. Snuggerud flashes high-end vision and passing skill from time to time, but is always responsible defensively, and smart positionally. Feels like the type who will wear many hats at the NHL level.","Jimmy Snuggerud is anything but your run-of-the-mill support player. He's flashed skill this season that would fit comfortably within the first 15 picks of this draft, if not better.
At his best, Snuggerud is an offensive driver with his puckhandling and playmaking, a conduit through which his team's in-zone offence flows. He'll display an understanding of offensive rotations and the game's motions indicative of an advanced thinker, worth at least a 6-grade for hockey sense.
""Snuggerud continued to show the same playmaking flashes at the tournament,"" Elite Prospects lead scout  wrote in an article summing up his play at the 2022 U18 World Hockey Championship. ""He really has a great under-standing of how to create for others. He holds on to the puck to let plays develop, cuts alongside the width of the ice to manipulate defenders, and deceives them with look-offs. You see both a high-level processing speed and anticipation abilities in some of his plays."" ""In the offensive zone, he opens up passing lanes with look-offs, stick handles, and fakes,""
You'll have no doubt noticed by this point the pains we've gone to to make sure that we qualify any admiration of Snuggerud's skill as appearing in flashes. That's the catch. You can go a week or two or three or more at a time without seeing it. And even at his very best, Snuggerud's low pace can sometimes limit his effectiveness as a distributor. He's not especially fleet of foot either.
The one constant is excellent support play at both ends of the ice. That's Snuggerud's bread and butter.
There aren't many better retrieval artists in the draft, and he may well be the strongest player in the class from his 
You'll even get the occasional flash of deception from Snuggerud, be it in the form of a look-off pass or a shoulder feint. Anything to open room to handle or a passing lane. And he has the touch as a passer to capitalize on those openings, feathering pucks through sticks and bodies, almost always onto his teammate's stick in prime shooting positions.
""While not as much of a facilitator as [Frank] Nazar or [Logan] Cooley, the Minnesota commit is particularly adept at finding teammates in transition and turning the play up ice quickly,"" Elite Prospects American regional scout  wrote in a mid-season profile of Snuggerud. hands to his elbows -- good luck parrying one of his stick-lifts going into the corner for a loose puck.
He's also a pretty effective defensive forward, with the high motor and strong reads combo that's formed the foundation of many an NHL checking line winger's game. You won't often catch Snuggerud out of position, and if you do, then you'll see him busting his ass to get back into the thick of the play post-haste. The hope with Snuggerud is that his flashes of high-end handling and passing skill are signs of better things to come and that he'll start to reveal his quality on a more consistent basis as he's put in situations to drive the bus. That wasn't really the case last season, as he often took a backseat to Logan Cooley and Cutter Gauthier.
At a minimum, you're probably getting a bottom-six winger who can feature in both phases of special teams and move up the lineup in a pinch in Snuggerud. History tells us that's a pretty solid outcome at this point in the draft.","Snuggerud's biggest asset stands out immediately: his shot.  He has an absolute cannon and one of the best shots in the draft.  Snuggerud scores from distance with ease and has a quick release.  He is big and strong for his age and uses his frame well.  

The biggest question for Snuggerud is his foot speed.  He isn't the fleetest of feet and could use some improvement on quickening his first step.  If he can improve in this area, a team could find themselves a potential scoring threat in the mid to late first round.  Snuggerud projects as a middle-six forward at the NHL level.  He will need development time and is likely 2-3 years away from NHL duty.","Jimmy Snuggerud is a speedy, offensive winger who can create chances in a multitude of ways for his team. He has high-quality puck skills, with fast hands and an elite shot that can beat goalies from almost anywhere in the offensive zone. He has a knack for getting the puck into the high-danger areas, and coupling that with his shot makes him one of the better scoring forwards the USNTDP has to offer this year. His skating is a plus for him, too. He has solid footwork that makes up for his lack of explosive speed. He's a good puckhandler and a capable transition player, but there is a tendency in his game to try and do too much with the puck on his stick. As he gets older and matures, he will need to learn when to try a high-risk, high-reward move and when to take what the defense gives him. Simple is better in this case. His offensive game is his bread and butter, and whoever drafts him will be doing so because of his ability to put the puck in the back of the net with regularity. His defensive game is a work in progress, though. He has good vision and understands where to be defensively, but he just needs to continue to work on his consistency. He might not slot in as a surefire top-six winger in the NHL, but with his skillset he has what it takes to be a middle-six offensive player who will be effective at five-on-five and carve out a role on special teams. He has seen his game improve as the season has progressed, and has found himself rising up the draft ranks as a result. It wouldn't be all that surprising to hear his name called a lot earlier than most would have predicted. This year's USNTDP was full of high-end forwards, and Snuggerud's name is rightfully among that list of intriguing options."
2022,RW,70,151,35,SEA,26,Jagger Firkus,"Firkus' skill and creativity stand out consistently. He shows great ability to beat defenders one-on-one with his stickhandling. He can make tough passes at a high rate through seams and under pressure. He is a shot-and-pass threat which makes him a major asset on a power play and often scores from range with a release that will beat NHL goalies. Firkus is quick, but not fast, showing good enough skating and compete to win battles but he's not going to beat NHL defenders wide. The scoring ability is significant enough that I think he can be a middle-six winger.","Firkus is one of those little guys who just always seems to be around it. He plays the game with pace, energy, and skill so that you can't help but notice him shift-to-shift as he dashes around the ice making plays offensively. With the puck, defenders struggle to stick with him off of cuts and when they do he's got the craftiness to beat them in other ways. Without the puck, he races in and out of pockets to get open. The result is a magnetic game that pulls you (and opposing players) in and then beats them with aggression and intention. Where scouts often ask questions about drafting a kid who is as light as he is in and around the first round (he's listed at 153 pounds), the way he plays the game has really endeared himself to just about everyone.

He does not lack confidence in his abilities either","Firkus can be an effective top six forward in the NHL and will be a valued asset on special teams. With his shot release and range, he can score goals will ease and snag top shelf snipes. He does a great job of creating dangerous chances in the slot. With that said, you are getting quality production from him. His play in the defensive zone is not as robust as it is in the offensive zone, but if you pair him with the right defensive-minded forwards, he can be rather effective at the next level.","With quick hands and one of the best releases in this class, Firkus raised his draft stock throughout the season. He has good-enough quickness with his feet to get around and through defenses and has the hands to make defenders miss. He's below average when it comes to size but has enough offensive tools for that not to matter as much. Firkus is the kind of player whose team is a bigger threat when the puck is on his stick. He can score from anywhere, but he has the playmaking ability to find the right option instead of just shooting for volume. He had 80 points in 66 games this year.","If a team wants to roll the dice on talent, this is the guy to do it on. Jagger Firkus is whisper-thin, but his game is loud. A rocket of a release, excellent hands, a shifty skater and he isn't afraid to attack the middle. Whether or not he can survive playing like that in the NHL is the million-dollar question."," Jagger Firkus is more than one of the draft's best names. He's also one of the best finishers in the class, and a pretty damn good playmaker, too.
A credible threat from range, Firkus beat WHL goaltenders from just about everywhere in the offensive zone last season. Perhaps most impressive was his ability to launch the puck from just about any physical arrangement; off of the inside or outside leg, against the grain, and often while contorting his body in every which direction.
""A central theme to Firkus' scoring game is attacking at angles and getting the defence and netminder to react to his movement,"" Elite Prospects Dir. of Film Scouting  wrote in a mid-season Scout's Notebook article on EP Rinkside. ""His ability to release it in-flight without first coasting to give away the game is highly translatable.
""Firkus also uses splendid technical abilities to generate a great deal of downward force on the shaft of his stick by connecting kinetic chains of energy from his lower body through his core, arms and finally the hands and wrists. His ability to pre-load, load, and culminate the mechanics are what drives his power despite the very slight frame."" A cursory glance at Firkus' shot chart from our partners at InStat Hockey bears out his ability to find twine from any position in the offensive zone – there's red goal markers just about everywhere on that plot. Still, it took some time for the Warriors forward to find the back of the net with any consistency. Firkus only scored twice in his first 10 games, and he looked more like a Day 2 pick than someone worthy of first-round consideration for a large chunk of the season. He relied far too much on shooting skill, often settling for low percentage shots and failing to do much damage as a result.
As the season progressed, though, Firkus added new elements to his game, and the points followed. His off-puck reads improved, as did his sense of timing. By about the midway point in the year, he was regularly driving the inside for scoring opportunities, too. He became a well-rounded scoring threat before our very eyes.
His playmaking followed a similar trajectory. The introduction of a delay game, in particular, did wonders for the Irma, Alberta-born winger.
""Firkus' delay game was working in this one,"" Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting  wrote in a May 11th game report. ""Where most players outrace, he cuts back and finds the trailer. He deceives inside the setup for those passes. If he can't delay, he'll find a different passing option or deke through pressure. Even if defenders take away his space on the pass reception, he'll find a way to get around them.""
His skating stride is the only tool in Firkus' offensive projection that really leaves anything to be desired. The lack of strength limits his ability to achieve any depth or the proper skating posture, and his heels kick wildly on every extension. He's shifty and relatively quick, but there's plenty of room to grow there. Just adding some strength is going to do wonders for Firkus' skating, and it's also going to have the added benefit of making him much more durable during wall-play and physical engagements at every end of the ice. At a slight 5-foot-10 and 154 pounds, that's not the case at present. There's a lot of upside here, though, and some team is going to take a hearty swing with their first-round pick to make sure he's in their organization because of it. He's a dual-threat scorer with high-end sense and an elite shot. There's legitimate 30-goal potential here. Then again, he would hardly be the first frail, average skating 5-foot-10 winger to fail to realize that potential.","My favorite name in the draft, Firkus had a stand-out season for Moose Jaw in the WHL.  Firkus' puck skills stand out immediately when watching him play.  He also has strong hockey sense and is highly confident with the puck on his stick.  Firkus pulled off the Michigan during a playoff game, showing both creativity and a healthy dose of self-confidence in his abilities.

Firkus is unique offensively in that he has a knack for scoring goals but is also a skilled playmaker.  This skill set will go a long way in making him a threat at the NHL level.  There are a few questions surrounding his strength and height.   He is considered slight by most standards and relies heavily on the deceptive nature of his offensive game to avoid contact and having to lean on bigger players.  Some question whether or not that will translate well to the NHL level.  However, his skill set is worth the risk in this area.  ","Jagger Firkus may be the biggest wildcard in this year's draft. His skillset and offensive potential scream top-six scoring winger who could also be dynamite on the power play. However, his size and skating leave question marks. It seems like every time he touches the puck he's going to do something to get you out of your seat. He's a top-notch playmaker who always knows what he's going to do with the puck before it reaches his stick. This is evident by how well he is able to find open seams and complete one-touch passes with regularity. His ability to process the play and understand where everyone is, friend or foe, is excellent. Off the rush or cycle, he's got a knack for feathering passes into a soft area of the ice that teammates are navigating their way towards. Another trademark trait is his slingshot-like wrist shot. He's got an extremely deceptive release and is able to pull the puck close to his body as he's releasing it to change the angle of the shot and fool goaltenders. The major worry with him is how much his physical traits will hold him back at the pro levels. As of right now, he's able to hold his own by using his smarts and puck skill. But will that be enough when everyone else is much bigger and stronger than him? Being short isn't a dealbreaker so long as a player is sturdy or a plus skater, but he is neither. There are a lot of times even at this level where he gets bottled up and eliminated from the play too easily, so that's an element of his game he needs to be sure to remedy. It'll be hard for Firkus to carve out a regular role in the NHL if he's not able to get stronger and faster. If he does, however, he may become a true steal because of the potential and upside he possesses."
2022,D,76.25,180,21,PIT,27,Owen Pickering,"Pickering's tools are evident to anyone who watches a game or two. He's a 6-foot-4 defenseman who skates quite well for his size and has offense. He can carry through the neutral zone to create controlled exits/entries and is good on retrievals. He can also pull up to make a good outlet or seam pass in the O-zone. He can use his size and feet to close on checks efficiently. Pickering's ascent has been quick, and thus there are some raw aspects with his play with the puck and overall consistency. He projects as a second or third-pair defenseman depending on how much the offense translates.","Pickering's offensive production doesn't jump out at you, but his long, effortless skating does. He's one of the smoothest gliders in the draft and through his pivots and backwards crossovers, effortlessly moving from forwards to backwards for a player his size. He's still really lean and has struggled to add muscle to his frame, but his north-south game is really impressive. There's some work to do to add elements to a smooth but unremarkable game inside the offensive zone but he was productive on a low-scoring team, his point shot is hard, and there are a growing number of folks (myself included) who think his skating will carry him to the NHL. I wouldn't balk at taking him in the 30s, but his ceiling as more of a complementary defenceman at the next level leaves me a little lower on him than some.","Had Pickering gotten the opportunity to play in a full season last year, it's possible that his game would be a little more refined. As it stands right now, however, he's a raw prospect with a lot of potential. Admittedly, we were harsh on Pickering in our Winter Rankings. Pickering's passing is a major concern, causing me to be more cautious of ranking him too high on our board. It's my belief that, in order to be a top defenseman in the NHL today, defensemen have to be able to move the puck in transition and in the offensive zone. I get glimpses of that from Pickering, but nothing on a consistent basis. That and his average defensive zone play have me worried about his odds of becoming an NHL player.

Still, it's unfair to talk about the bad aspects of Pickering's game without also acknowledging that most, if not all of these areas are teachable. Pickering can be molded into a top four defenseman capable of seeing time on a power play unit and, with enough development, maybe even the penalty kill. I mentioned at the beginning of this report that Pickering was one of the biggest “what if” players in this draft class, and it's true. What if he becomes a better passer? What if he becomes a dominant force in transition? What if Pickering becomes an elite two way defender? All of these are possible when you look at his current skill set. It's going to take the right team and the right development path for Pickering to get to that point, though.

Teams should avoid trying to turn Pickering into a shutdown or stay at home defender. That's not how he plays, and he'll plateau in the minors if that happens. The team that will get the most out of Pickering is the team that lets him continue to move the puck in transition and quarterback a power play unit. Keep teaching him defensive responsibility and work with him on his passing and you'll reap the rewards in four to five years.

So, what does Pickering's projection look like? I see a 4+ year timeline to the NHL. At his peak, Pickering can be a top four defenseman seeing power play time for an NHL team, providing solid two way play and roughly 30-40 points. This timeline is contingent on Pickering improving on his passing and defensive positioning while climbing the ranks in the pros, however. It's a good reminder that development isn't linear. If a player is drafted in the top 50, it doesn't mean that they need to be ready for the NHL immediately after juniors or after one pro season. Sometimes, it takes more time than that. Pickering's development will be a slow cook but the team that drafts him will be very glad they waited.","A towering defenseman with excellent mobility for a big man, Pickering has a lot of tools that stand out. There's some raw potential there as I think his anticipation and overall hockey sense still need to advance to make him a more effective two-way player. Offensively, he is adequate, but there are flashes of greater potential. He did have 33 points in 62 games for a poor Swift Current team this season. As he gets a bit more aggressive and confident with the puck on his stick, it could open up the possibility of him one day becoming a top-four defender.","Something of an unfinished product, Pickering has added nine inches and 40 pounds over the last 30 months and is still feeling out the new length. Can really impress with his retrievals and transitional looks. Owns the potential to be a serious stopper too. Tons of room to grow and develop. The mystery upside is just too intriguing to pass up.","You don't draft players for what they are as 18-year-olds but for what they'll one day become as fully formed NHLers. This is especially true of Owen Pickering, who is as raw an A-grade prospect as you'll find in this year's draft. The tools are formidable. The Swift Current Broncos de-fender is a 6-foot-5 puck-moving, two-way defenceman with plus-level hands, passing skill, and sense. There's a lot to work with here.
That profile makes him a pretty capable transition piece. Pickering rated in the 85th percentile by the transitional data that Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting  tracked from his draft year, a combination of zone entry and exit inputs. Here's what had to say of Pickering's breakout ability ahead of the 2022 U18 World Hockey Championships.
""The core of Pickering's game is what he does with the puck. On retrievals, he deceives, cuts back, then sprints to the inside. With head fakes and changes of pace, he mis-directs forecheckers and then hits a teammate up the ice. When he's not leading the rush, he's joining it. And that activation interacts with his projectable shot and exciting playmaking flashes.""
You'll note that we haven't included Pickering's skating stride as part of his transitional skill set. That's one tool that remains a work in progress, though, that's to be expected for a 6-foot-5 18-year-old, especially one that's grown 10 inches (10!) in the last three seasons. “I missed the last couple of months of the previous year..."" Pickering told Elite Prospects Dir. of Film Scouting . ""Just kind of growth spurt stuff -- knee issues, back [issues].""
His pivots are still a bit clumsy, and his high stance limits his explosiveness. There just isn't much hip engagement there. Hope for improvement lies in the fact that he's still a solid 30-plus or so pounds away from his NHL playing weight, and as he adds that muscle, we anticipate his skating form will take a turn for the better. For now, it's a slight weakness, one that impacts his handling and separation ability with the puck.
That fact doesn't seem to put a damper on Pickering's enthusiasm for activating into the play at every opportunity. It seems like he's at the centre of everything whenever he steps onto the ice, and the up-tempo, freewheeling style of the Broncos' system doesn't exactly rein him in.
The same sense and play-reading ability that makes Pickering an effective player in the offensive zone applies in his own zone, too. He anticipates developing plays well and makes proactive moves to cut them off before they can devel-op. And his range grants him exceptional corrective ability.
You're probably looking at a long-term developmental project with Pickering, but the payoff could be pretty sweet. Everything is there for him to develop into a well-rounded, all situations top-four defenceman at the NHL level. Perhaps better if he lands in the right spot.
That makes him one of the first round's wildcards, and a candidate to go a fair bit higher than where we have him ranked.","There's a lot to like about Pickering, and it begins with his 6'4 frame and long skating stride.  He also has some offense to his game, which makes Pickering a potential mid-round first-round pick.  

Pickering's stock rose significantly as the season progressed.  In the day of smaller, more skilled blueliners, tall ones with a long reach that can skate are becoming more of an oddity.  Pickering can also carry the load to some extent offensively.  He isn't afraid to rush or carry the puck and he doesn't panic under pressure.  

Because of Pickering's rise, he is still considered to be a player with a lot of underdeveloped tools.  Whoever drafts him will need time to give him ample development time.  Pickering projects as a second-pairing defender and he is likely 3-4 years away from competing for a roster spot at the NHL level.","Owen Pickering is a tall, rangy defender whose long-term potential has scouts salivating. He's a solid two-way defender who is only just scratching the surface of what he can do in all facets of the game. He's already the top guy for Swift Current, logging massive minutes. For a blueliner of his huge size his skating is his best attribute, skills that were honed before a late growth spurt. He has a powerful, clean stride and good foot speed. He likes to carry the puck up from his own zone and has the fluidity of feet and the sureness of hands to do it well. He's just as impressive skating backwards, able to crossover cleanly, which helps him maintain a good gap while defending rush opportunities. He is an effective passer. He makes good decisions on breakouts and is able to pass the puck to teammates while they're breaking out in stride. He possesses both an NHL-caliber wrist and slap shot from the point. He uses his long reach to his advantage while defending in his zone, as he is able to break up cycle attempts by poke-checking or he can easily pick off passes simply because his reach is so long. An attribute He could try and develop a bit more is his offensive instinct. He more often than not makes the safe decision when it comes to things like pinching in the offensive zone or taking open ice given to him, not truly opening things up himself or helping drive the puck to the net. While making the safe decision definitely isn't a horrible thing, he could benefit his team by being more aggressive and assertive in certain situations. Pickering has taken major strides in his development, and it still seems like he is only just getting started. That thought makes him an intriguing fit for a team looking to the blue line."
2022,D,72.5,201,37,WSH,28,Ryan Chesley,"Chesley has some physical assets that pop off the page from a pro projection. He's a NHL-caliber skater who can transition pucks up ice very well with his speed. He has average size, but he's quite strong and physical. With his mobility he's able to close on checks well, and often uses his body to land hard hits to separate pucks from players. He has good individual skill, with the hands to beat checks one-on-one and generate a lot of power off his one-timer. Chesley isn't a gifted puck-mover though and can struggle at times with his puck distribution. He projects as a full-time second- or third pair defenseman depending on how much the offense translates to higher levels.","Chesley, one of the more universally well-liked prospects in this draft among NHL folks, has been a top prospect in this age group for years and has developed into a well-rounded, hard-shooting two-way defender. After a slow start to his year, he really came on late and played his best hockey when all eyes were on him down the stretch into U18 worlds. I like him in neutral ice on both sides of the puck. He's got a great stick. He can really rip it when he takes the five-to-eight feet available off of the line and looks for his own shot. Balanced skating mechanics, good posture, and an ability and willingness to defend with the body and stick help him defend at a very high level man-to-man. And while his production doesn't leap off the page at you, that's largely because Hutson and Casey were the go-to power-play defencemen at the program. He looks and plays a lot like a pro already and was counted upon to play alongside Hutson on Team USA's top pairing in the program (a trust that was also reflected in the ‘A' on his jersey). His game lacks the creativity of Hutson and Casey, but I've learned not to confuse his “what-you-see-is-what-you-get” game for being ordinary. He's extremely effective and there's still some aggressiveness and skill to his package, even if it's more predictable.","Chesley and Lane Hutson are an interesting dynamic. Hutson is very creative and mobile. He has good body language and can shift his body to a new lane on a dime. Chesley isn't as nimble and mobile. That just isn't his game. Chesley does have the same drive to create high and medium danger chances in the slot, but he is more likely to pinch up the boards with the puck than go into open ice and battle it out against attackers at the perimeter. The good thing is that Chesley seems to have the support of the USNTDP coaching staff to let him play his game. Chesley knows that he has to be somewhat conservative given that Hutson can be far more out-going in the offensive zone. I do think will Chesley will be a solid two-way defender in the NHL level. If he can be slightly more consistent with his drive to create high danger chances, he could be provide nice defensive depth in a second or third pairing role. Chesley will also need to address his acceleration / skating as oppositional speed will only get more and more daunting at the NHL level.","His offensive numbers won't jump out at you, but Chesley might be one of the most well-rounded defenders in this entire draft. He is an excellent skater with tremendous defensive sense highlighted by his gap control and ability to defend the rush. He retrieves pucks especially well and can aid his team's transition with his feet or with a good first pass. Chesley has a good shot, too, but we didn't get to see it as much this year. He takes what is given to him offensively, doesn't try to force things and he just always seems to make the right play in his own zone. His hockey sense is some of the best among defensemen in this draft and I would not be surprised to see him go a bit higher. If he had better offensive numbers this year and could more consistently prove that offensive prowess is there, I would have likely considered Chesley more seriously for the top 15 of this class. I'm just not sure if the skill is good enough for him to get there. If he does, though, we might look back at Chesley as the best defenseman in this class.","The steady presence on the Program's top pairing all season, Chesley can also show off some offensive skills. He likely plays a new-age shutdown role at the next level but can skate and move the puck well enough to play up the lineup. The righty likely goes earlier than this spot.","There was a serious disconnect between Ryan Chesley's output this season and the tools at his disposal. Every item in his toolkit earned an average-to-above-average grade from our staff, but the sum was often less than the whole of its parts.
It was easy enough for us to identify where the disconnect occurred. When Chesley took the initiative with the puck and tried to make things happen, the game looked easy. When he wasn't playing with pace, not so much.
In no phase of the game was this more apparent than on the breakout. Chesley's four-way mobility and handling skill allowed him to manoeuvre past forecheckers with relative ease, but finding passing options further up-ice and getting them the puck in a timely fashion often eluded him. The result was lost opportunities to cue quick breaks and counter plays at best and costly turnovers at worst.
It's much the same story in the offensive zone, where Chesley's inability to register options and get them the puck in a timely fashion limits his effectiveness as a playmaker.
""Despite having the tools to make high-end offensive plays, however, Chesley rarely takes charge of the game,"" Elite Prospects lead scout  wrote in a Scout's Notebook article on EP Rinkside. ""He fades into the background. The defenceman [had] just 15 points in 41 games over the season, a low total for such a highly-touted player coming into the season."" Some of these processing issues should improve with minor tweaks to his game; simple stuff like scanning for options going into retrievals and off-puck will go a long way. We also anticipate that a more predictable system that doesn't rely as much on the stretch pass as the program will help keep him on schedule. So, there's hope yet.
To his credit, Chesley finished the season on a strong note, playing his best hockey of the year in Germany at the U18s on the American top-pair alongside Lane Hutson. ""If I had room for a third defenceman on my U18 All-Star ballot, I'd have a hard time thinking of a more deserving candidate than Chesley,"" EP Rinkside Editor-in-Chief J.D. Burke wrote of his work at the tournament.
""Our scouting team has always admired Chesley's tools -- the skating, the stout physical build, and the passing skill -- but concerns about his ability to process the game with pace have kept him from the first round of our board. We may have to change that, because Chesley was one of the tournament's most efficient puck-movers, regularly identifying the best option and getting them the puck without a moment's delay.""
Short of any growth as a puck-mover, Chesley still has a durable defensive foundation on which he can build an NHL career. His skating form allows him to play a tight gap through the neutral zone and close on attackers before they even get to the blue line. He's at his best as an in-zone defender, though, where his defensive radius and physicality make him a legitimate play-stopper.
Some team is going to bet on Chesley's immense physical gifts in the hopes that time with an NHL development staff can bring out the best in the Minnesota commit. They'll probably do so with a pick in the teens at that. It's not an unreasonable play, either. If things break right, you're looking at a right-shot, top-four defenceman with utility in both phases in special teams. The league places a premium on those sorts of players.",A solid two-way defender can play in some situations.  Offensive ceiling is a question at the next level.,"Ryan Chesley is a strong, two-way defender who does tend to place more emphasis on the defensive side of the game. With his strong skating and positional discipline, he is a strong rush defender and more than adequate when the opposition has a longer stay in his end. He uses his footwork and his stick positioning to force puck-carriers away from the center lane to negate potential high-danger chances off the rush. Offensively, he does have the ability to drive transitional play. He's a strong skater with good vision and a knack for making a crisp and accurate first pass. His offensive production doesn't jump off the page at all, which may lower some people's opinion of him, especially with the way the game is evolving but just because his production isn't impressive doesn't mean his ability to play the offensive game is lacking. There may be some hidden offensive creativity however, after he played the de facto stay-at-home role when routinely paired with the offensive Lane Hutson, who loved to push the envelope offensively. His biggest issue is his ceiling. He's not all that flashy and won't wow anyone with an abundance of highly skilled plays, but what he will do is play quality minutes and rarely put his team behind the eight-ball whenever he is out there. He flashed a bit of his offensive potential at the Under-18s and showed what he can do when he decides to take the reins off himself. If he can be the player he was at that late-season tournament more consistently, then there'd be more belief he has a much higher ceiling at the NHL level. Chesley isn't the flashiest of prospects, but is the type of player who will carve out a long and quality career because of the reliable presence he brings when he's on the ice."
2022,LW,73,185,60,CAR,29,Gleb Trikozov,Trikozov is a talented winger. He displays great individual skills and creativity with the puck to often beat opponents one-on-one. He can create for himself with his skill while also showing great vision and instincts as a playmaker to find seams. Trikozov's vision and shot make him a threat from the perimeter and an asset on the power play. His skating is just OK and his game in general can lack pace. I waver on his compete. I've seen games he takes nights off and other games he's engaged and works hard on both sides of the puck. Trikozov projects as a full-time bottom-six winger.,"rikozov's probably the player here whose ranking is hurt the most by the approach I've taken to slotting the Russians, because he'd slot at the front end of my 29-66 tier on strictly his own merits, but it's also the widest tier and he's not so clearly a cut above the kids in the 50s that I'd be rushing to take him ahead of them given the current uncertainty about what comes next for players in Russia. Where he goes will depend, as a result, more on the NHL club that's picking and the info they've gathered about his plans/hopes, with most teams likely opting to steer clear. If I'm at the table, I'm likely playing it a smidge safe with Trikozov until this point in the draft (though I'd definitely still consider taking him over the few names directly in front of him here, where a divide does start to emerge a little more).","When I watch Trikozov, I come away entertained after each and every game. He reminds me so much of San Jose Sharks prospect Daniil Gushchin. Will he blow you away with his defensive play? There are times, but it's not consistent. But, where he does shine is in the neutral and offensive zones. His stick-handling ability will improve and he will be a pain in the rear for attackers who struggle to defend against flashy stick-handling. Trikozov can carry his own line and has proven at the MHL level that he is slightly under matched. There are games where he doesn't exert aggression and play tight to the vest hockey on the forecheck, but has shown that he has the speed and the capability to do so at the VHL level. The KHL level is next on the horizon and I look forward to seeing what Avangard Omsk will get at the KHL level with Trikozov. 

If everything goes according to plan, I feel confident that you are getting an impact top six forward with Trikozov at the NHL level. He is a prospect who I would bet on at the 2022 NHL Draft.","Only 2023 draft phenom Matvei Michkov scored at a higher rate than Trikozov this season. With 45 points in 35 games, Trikizov averaged 1.29 points per game this season. There's no question he has the offensive ability to produce. My concern is in his skating and willingness to compete for his offense. He's great at exploiting gaps and finding openings to score, but I don't think there's a ton of value off the puck and I'm not sure exactly where he slots in. The reason I still like him in this range is because those hand skills and his anticipation are quality tools that could make him an offensive threat if he finds the other areas of his game.","One of the youngest players in the class, Trikozov tore up the MHL from down the lineup and was even better in the playoffs. He has good skills across the board, and can sometimes look like a genius out there, and then other times frustrate with decision making. Some love him, some think his game is too immature. I land somewhere in the middle.","There was no more contentious a 2022 NHL Draft prospect for the Elite Prospects scouting team than Gleb Trikozov. The esteem in which we held him -- it was a land of contrasts.
On the one side, you had a rousing endorsement from our Russian regional scout Dylan Griffing in the form of a top-10 rating. On the other, you had crossover work by Elite Prospects lead scout  placing him in the second round. The rest of the staff fell somewhere between those two extremes, and his final ranking reflects that. Compromise, it's a good thing.
Those who find themselves in his corner assembled early in the year, marvelling at the displays of advanced planning and playmaking at the Hlinka-Gretzky Cup. Sure, he wasn't connecting on many of his passes -- they hit his linemates' shin pads and pants more often than their stick --, but the thought process that informed many of these plays was miles ahead of the competition in most contests.
Everything you look for in a projectable playmaker was there. Trikozov would attack the defensive front on an arc, pull defenders into his orbit, manipulate with shoulder feints and eye-level deception, and then dispatch of the puck to the best-positioned linemate. The result was a point per game showing at the tournament despite playing a depth role.
It wasn't until about the midway point in the season that the Russian winger started to better modulate the weight and timing on his passes, at which point, it was game over for his opponents. He was an elite, productive playmaking winger in the MHL, and the only thing that held him back was his ice time and linemates who failed to capitalize on his playmaking quality.
He's hardly a one-trick pony, though. Trikozov can beat a goalie in any number of different ways. He has genuine touch as a handler and force as a finisher, even if the mechanical form leaves a fair bit to be desired. The 6-foot-1 winger handles the puck far out in front of him, exposing it to unnecessary risk from opposing defenders, and his high grip means that he's only engaging his upper body on his release.
Even with those mechanical quirks as a shooter and handler, Trikozov managed to tally 45 points in 35 MHL contests last season; his 1.29 points per game second to only Danila Yurov in per-game output. The one caveat to that production is that the MHL's Eastern Conference that Omskie Yastreby played in is far weaker than the West, but his 18 points in 13 playoff games did a lot to allay any concerns we might have had about empty-calorie scoring. That seven of these points came in five games against Krasnaya Armiya Moskva makes it that much better.
The more critical take on Trikozov isn't without merit, though. We've already broached his lack of touch as a distributor (even if that's less of a problem now than at the beginning of the season), but the list of shortcomings doesn't stop there. He's not an especially explosive skater. His confidence as a handler greatly exceeds his skill. And there's an obvious lack of strength there, too.
There's a lot of risk with this player, and that's before one even accounts for the ""Russian factor"" part of the equation. Trikozov's playmaking and sense look like relatively strong NHL projections, but his handling and shooting have a long way to go before they're credible tools at that level. There's top-six upside here, but it's going to take a rigorous development regimen to bring out the best in him.",Russian winger has high-end offensive skill.  Didn't play much against high competition.  Will need plenty of time but has high upside.,"Gleb Trikozov is a skilled and creative forward who thrives at generating offense through extended periods of puck possession. He is immediately noticeable with the puck on his stick due to his advanced puck skills and offensive creativity. He is a very shifty and elusive player, able to stickhandle through traffic in the offensive zone and evade checks through quick pivots, allowing him to extend offensive zone possession of the puck and open up attacking lanes. He often shows high-end offensive instincts, displaying equal ability as both a finisher and a set-up man. He reads the offensive zone very well, able to make plays off the cycle to set up teammates or find soft spots of ice for himself to make himself available as a shooting option. He's a capable shooter, able to pick spots on opposing netminders while shooting from a standstill, though he could show improvement in his ability to shoot in stride as his shots while attacking on the rush generally lack the strength required to score from medium-to-long range. Though he shows high-end offensive traits, there are deficiencies in his overall decision-making that will need improvement for him to become a reliable pro player. He's guilty of working himself out of room and into situations where he's forced into turnovers, whether that be by having the puck poked off his own stick or by throwing the puck away when faced with limited space. He could also stand to show more engagement in his own zone. Overall, Trikozov has the potential to become a top-six forward at the NHL level, and will need to overcome his hurdles in his decision-making, defensive engagement, and add more strength to his frame to be a frequent contributor in the NHL."
2022,D,68.25,158,62,MON,30,Lane Hutson,"Hutson is a constant threat with the puck on his stick. He's the smartest player in the draft. He makes so many seam passes to generate chances. Hutson is also a highly-skilled puckhandler who shows great creativity off the offensive blue line. He makes a lot of crafty fakes and dekes to evade pressure. He's not the fastest skater, but his edgework is quite good and allows him to use his skating to attack. The offense is clear NHL quality. Whether a barely 5-foot-9 defenseman who isn't an elite skater can defend in the NHL is the question with Hutson. He's a competitive, quality defender versus juniors and college opponents but that will need to be a test he'll need to clear down the line. I think he plays in the NHL, and projects as an offensive-tilted top-four defenseman, but I realize the odds are against a player who looks like him becoming that. I stamp him this high because he's the smartest player in the draft and I see just enough to the rest of his game to be able to elevate at higher levels.","The reality is there aren't many defencemen Hutson's size who play in the NHL, even as the game changes. And those guys have never been selected in the first round. But there aren't many players who play like Hutson in hockey either. I often get asked just how high he'd go if he were 6-foot-3 and the reality is that he wouldn't able to do a lot of what makes him so interesting at that size. He's a unique player who uses a light (though not powerful) stride to create entries and exits, weave past coverage, escape pressure, and find or create seams.

He sees the ice as well as anyone in the draft, regularly identifying plays a step ahead of the opposition. He's got an uncanny knack for executing long east-to-west plays, whether that's feathering high, leading saucer passes with perfect weight cross-ice or flinging a hard pass to a streaking teammate's tape. He makes a ton of plays under pressure when other players would panic (though sometimes he could actually use some hurry-up to his game haha). Inside the offensive zone, though his shot lacks power, he acts as a fourth forward with his ability to slide off the line and create.

He's got shakes and shimmies to spare, routinely making opposing defenders miss one-on-one in all three zones. He's one of the most clever players in the draft. And while his size will continue to make evaluators pause, I actually quite like the way he defends. He gets back to so many loose pucks that he doesn't have to rely all that much on engaging in battles and even when he does, his positioning and active stick help him disrupt opposing carriers and break up plays. But above all else, he's the kind of player where when you think you've put him in a difficult spot or you've got him cornered, he'll show you that he isn't with a spin (or a spin into a spin!), a fake (with his eyes, or head, or shoulders, or hands, or feet, or each) or his sublime vision through layers. He just looks right past what's in front of him. I wouldn't be surprised if he becomes a sly No. 4 defenceman in time. I'm fascinated to see where he's picked, because I wouldn't shy away from taking him in the late first and if he's around on Day 2 it'd be a no-brainer for me.","Lane Hutson will be a fun addition to your blue line. He is the kind of guy, who will be extremely fun to watch in all situations. 5v5 and on the power play. His mobility and soft passes make him an effective puck distributor and he will rack up assists. Defensively, he gives you solid gap control and keeps you in low danger with an active stick. I project Hutson as a second pairing defenseman at the NHL level.","Though he is among the smallest defensemen in this draft, he is a highly intelligent two-way player with dynamic offensive ability. While he's not a straight-line blazer, Hutson's skating is deceptive and creative. His ability to change directions on a dime is one of his best attributes and makes him difficult to track for the opposition when he has the puck. With elite vision and soft hands, he makes a lot of plays in all zones. Defensively, he has one of the best sticks in the draft, which allows him to make up some for his size disadvantage. He's totally committed to defending despite that size disadvantage and the dynamic skill set. I think he's one of the most exciting players in this draft, but I fully understand the limitations that someone at his size could face at the next level. There's a good chance Hutson won't go in the first round, but I have very little doubt he will prove disbelievers wrong by making it and being a solid NHL player. He's that fiery of a competitor.","The shiftiest defender in the class is also the smallest. Hutson shone on the man-advantage with the Program for his creative, elusive and puck-possession style. But also got turnstiled far too often at the junior level. Has freakishly long arms and made a case for why he should add some more height. Another big swing at this spot but the brain and skill make it fun.","There is a significant divide between the degree to which our staff likes Lane Hutson's game and how well we think it will translate to the NHL level. One that, unfortunately, took a player with several components that would grade as first-round calibre and forced him to the second round on our final board.
Few in this draft can match Hutson's quality from the offensive blue line as a defender. The way that the 5-foot-8 blueliner evades opponents with weight shifts, handling moves, and fakes allow him to turn every puck touch into a Grade-A scoring chance, whether he's the one pulling the trigger or as a setup man.
""He is a master of the weight shift fake move,"" Elite Prospects lead scout  wrote in a mid-season Scout's Notebook article on EP Rinkside. ""As a defender is coming at him, he leans to one side, indicating that he's going that way, before exploding toward the other when the defender bites on the fake. This move allows him to attack down the blue line toward the slot, where he's in an even more dangerous position to create.""
His cunning as a distributor is mostly expressed in his ability to anticipate plays coupled with the patience to let them develop before dispatching the puck to the stick of a waiting teammate. The end result of which was Hutson placing in the 98th percentile as an expected primary assist generator according to the data set that Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting  tracked. The 53 assists at retail value in 60 games with the USNTDP U18 squad last season isn't half bad either.
All of these same hallmarks -- the manipulative handling and skating patterns, the patience as a distributor, and the skill as a passer -- in Hutson's game that made him so effective from the offensive blue line translate to transition play, too.
Where Hutson may find trouble as a puck-moving defenceman at the next level -- and perhaps in general -- is in the lack of a separating gear as a skater and a mechanically grim forward stride. For all his grace, agility, and shiftiness, this part of his skating profile is nowhere near where it needs to be for his game to translate to the NHL.
 explains in a mid-season article on the USNTDP: ""Hutson's feet flail as his knee bend changes wildly from one move to the next, limiting stability, explosiveness and control."" And when Hutson gets beat in space, that's it. Game over. His inability to access his outside edges means that he's done. It's as fatal a flaw as one can have as a defenceman. Without significant -- and we mean significant -- improvement to this part of his game, there's very little hope that he'll feature in anything more than a depth role at the NHL level -- if that. To his credit, Hutson defends admirably along the boards and in body-on-body defensive sequences for a 5-foot-8 defenceman. He scans well, stays on top of the play, and cuts opponents off at the hands going in for loose pucks. No issues there.
But if you're a 5-foot-8 offensive defenceman who can't defend in space because of fatal flaws as a skater, well, that could be a problem. Perhaps Hutson can take the steps to rectify it en route to a lengthy, productive NHL career. Here's hoping, because the league would be so much better for having his creativity from the blue line. He's a hell of a lot of fun to watch at his best","If Hutson was 6'0, he would easily be in conversation as a top-10 pick in the draft.  Whenever I watched him play this season, he stood out.  Hutson is a highly skilled offensive defenseman.  Hutson is an elite skater and uses his edges well to create space for himself, particularly on the blue line in the offensive zone.  He has elite hockey sense as well with an uncanny ability to find open players with both short and long passes in all three zones.

Hutson plays a confident offensive game, can run a powerplay, and moves the puck up the ice with ease.  The biggest question surrounding Hutson is his size.  There aren't many defenders under 5'10 at the NHL level. While some scouts hope Hutson has a bit of room to grow, there's some concern regarding his reach and whether he will struggle to break up plays defensively.  If Hutson gets stronger, I think his size becomes less of an issue and his offensive tool kit means his teams frequently have possession of the puck, also taking away many issues defensive liabilities could have.  

Hutson projects as an offensive-minded top-four defender.  He is likely 3-4 years away from NHL duty.","Lane Hutson is an exciting, offensive-minded defender who has quick feet and even quicker hands. With his quick stride, high-end agility, and footwork, he is one of the most elite skating blueliners the class has to offer. He loves jumping into the rush and carrying the puck up the ice from the defensive zone. He has a lot of patience with the puck on his stick, allowing him to scan the entire ice surface for a lane of attack. A fearless offensive player, he is never afraid to use his speed and creativity to exploit opposing players in one-on-one situations. His physical traits can pose a bit of an issue for him, especially when trying to adjust to the NHL or even the NCAA. His frame limits the range he has while defending, particularly when defending the rush. It's difficult for him to use his body to angle opponents away from the center of the ice, and when he does try to cut off a lane with his body or his stick, he overextends himself, making vulnerable to quick changes of direction. His defending improves in close quarters situations when his reach isn't as big of an issue, but he will want to add some strength to his frame to help improve his close-quarters defending. With his high offensive ceiling and defensive issues, it's not unreasonable to qualify him as a potential boom-or-bust player, but there is a solid foundation present in his game. His positives easily outweigh his negatives, and drafting Hutson likely gets you a top-four defenseman who can run your top power play unit for a long time. In a class loaded with quality defensemen, Hutson, for both his flaws and positive characteristics, might just be the most exciting defenseman in the entire draft. He's certainly already one of the most dynamic."
2022,D,69.5,173,46,NJD,31,Seamus Casey,"Casey has NHL-caliber skating and skill. His ability to skate pucks out of trouble and up the ice is quite noticeable. He has good hands to maneuver in tight areas and make skilled rushes. On the power play, he displays good poise and vision to make plays and can make strong outlets too. I wouldn't call him truly dynamic with the puck though, which leaves some scouts wondering, as a small defenseman, what his NHL role will be. He defends well enough in junior due to his skating, but for a 5-foot-10 defenseman his defending will be the question as he advances levels. I project him as a full-time third pair defenseman. .","Casey had a bit of an up-and-down season, with a strong start and finish briefly overcast by some struggles in the middle which prompted some scouts to question his first-round merits and his decision-making. I really like a lot of his tools in isolation. When he's on, there's an unmistakable flow to his game where the puck just moves through him to its next destination within the pace of play, whether that's a heady outlet out of a D-to-D pass or a quick carry into a cross-ice pass to allow his teammates to get open for him. Inside the offensive zone, he can make things happen with his blend of mobility and handling (he walks the line effortlessly but he also handles the puck like a forward one on one). Inside the defensive zone, he thrives escaping past pressure.

He looks effortless out there, weaving in and out of coverage, and mixing in delays and fakes with the puck to create space for himself or take it from others. He's a fabulous puck transporter through neutral ice and a tactile player inside the offensive zone, where his footwork shines through. He's undersized and will need to get stronger in college, but his feet and stick help compensate and really began to show up in the more consistent stops he began making down the stretches. He can also comfortably play his off side (the left side), providing added versatility.
","I'm going to start by saying that if you are drafting Seamus Casey for the player he is right now, then I believe the player he is right now is worth a late-first to early-second round pick with a player profile or player comparison similar to Henri Jokiharju.

The three game sample I tracked (one USHL game and two against NCAA D1 programs) yielded promising results. He's completing 76% of his passes, mitigating defensive transitions, and successful in about 70% of his offensive transitions in total. I defer to those in the public sphere with deeper analytical microstat analysis, but from my own data he's tracking pretty well, minus his medium/high danger passing and shot attempts.

The way I view the prospect of drafting Seamus Casey is to take a step back and view Seamus Casey on where he could be in three years with proper development. When taking this approach then I, personally, think he could be the best defensemen to come out of the 2022 draft.

A lot of what Seamus Casey needs to improve on is more procedural and flipping a switch to tell Casey to be more aggressive, if not selfish, in his offensive approach to the game. To use his skill to manipulate defenders more often at the blue line in the offensive zone so that he is able to find passing lanes in dangerous parts of the ice or to get a shot off. To activate more from the blue line off the puck to receive passes or to dive/scissor down more instead of moving laterally on the blue line when a teammate is coming up the boards. To carry the puck and eat up more space with the puck on his stick, and to identify the proper read in a transition and use his skill to make the pass for a controlled exit/entry instead of opting for an uncontrolled chip out or dump in. He's rarely joining rushes and I'd like to see him both try to lead and join the rush as a trailing option.

 I love his defensive game, but if he can unlock the potential in his offensive approach and utilize the high-end skills he has: he goes from projecting as a middle-pair defensemen to being a top-pair defenseman with PP1 potential.

It's been touched on a little bit in this report already, but Seamus Casey's biggest development of skill that needs to be worked on is another gear in his three-step agility and his north/south speed. His edges and lateral mobility are top end, but his inability to generate quick speed or utilize crossovers to generate speed limits his separation coming out from pressure. He is able to mitigate his backwards mobility by having elite pivots to go from surfing a defender coming into the defensive zone and then pivoting when the opposing forward tries to manipulate their speed by slowing down to cut inside. Being able to move north/south at an above NHL-level speed would do wonders for his game as well.

I lean towards taking Casey as one of the first defenders off the board in the 2022 draft for these developmental reasons. There's so much to work with from his skill, intelligence, and ability to use lateral and deceptive motions to create space and get by defenders. With Casey going to Michigan in 2022 and the graduation of Blankenburg and the exodus of Owen Power it's going to open up a PP2 role behind Luke Hughes. Given Mel Pearson's history of leaning into the strengths of is defenders and Casey getting 2-3 years of developing in a system that will adhere to his strengths: Casey is poised to flourish.

","One of the best skating defensemen in this draft, Casey has so many tools that make you believe he can be a special player down the road. The issue is that he hasn't quite put it all together yet and he's not especially big. There's skill and that skating ability, but he doesn't finish plays particularly well and it leads me to wonder if the vision is where it needs to be for him to be productive. Casey defends well enough and manages to hang with players in transition quite well thanks to his high-end footwork. ","A high-level handler who excels with drag and slip plays, Casey is effective on the backhand, and can fluidly turn his dekes into shots or passes with the newly opened lanes.  Unfortunately, Casey lacks real pace with the puck, and looks lost defensively too often -- not great at his size.","Seamus Casey isn't just one of this draft's most gifted puckhandling defencemen. He's one of the draft's most gifted puckhandlers, period. There are 16 skaters out of 313 in the Elite Prospects 2022 NHL Draft Guide with a 6.5-grade or better as a puckhandler on our 1-to-9 linear scale, and he's one of them.
His technique as a handler is nearly perfect, and he's as comfortable on the forehand as he is on the backhand; as comfortable blending the first touch or pass reception into a dangle as he is a dangle into a pass or a shot. It's a real thing of beauty to watch the right-shot defender when he's feeling it with the puck on his stick.
""Due to his high-end handling skills, Casey can make plays that are not accessible to most defencemen,"" Elite Prospects lead scout  wrote in a Scout's Notebook article on EP Rinkside. ""He can freeze defenders with fakes, drag the puck under their stick, and open them up to slide passes through their skates. His handling skill is especially useful on breakouts, where he can beat forecheckers 1-on-1 and connect with teammates in the middle of the ice, and at the top of the offensive zone, where he can manipulate defenders to create lanes for his shots."" At one point this season, we were so smitten by Casey's skill that we assigned him a first-round grade on our debut board; a position we spent the balance of the season walking back as we accumulated views as a team and saw lots of flash and little substance.
This phenomenon often expressed itself in the form of hope passes. Casey would handle his way past an opponent and then use his newly created space to launch a seemingly aimless pass into the slot. The sort of thing that happens when a player isn't really planning any of his forays from the offensive blue line and into the zone and relying on pure instinct.
So while we doubtless admire his skill as a handler, we mostly see that as a tool that will confer advantages in transition at the next level rather than the offensive zone. We have far more proof of concept at the junior level to feel comfortable about that part of his projection if nothing else.
That skill as a handler allows Casey to draw in forecheckers, dart past them up-ice, and create a numbers advantage as his team gains the offensive zone. A capable short-range passer and never one to miss an opportunity for a quick break, this 5-foot-10 has already developed a fully-formed transition game, one that projects comfortably to the next level. ""Casey is just so smooth with his skating and handles, and he rarely makes mistakes,"" Elite Prospects American regional scout  wrote in a September game report. ""He's elusive and has the ability to beat F1 himself on the breakout if needed. He thrives in transition play and advances the puck up ice, even if it means circling back into his own end and reevaluating options.""
You couple that skill in transition with Casey's stout in-zone defensive play, and you have the basis for a potential NHL career as a third-pairing, puck-moving defenceman with some utility on the back end of each special teams unit. And if he tones down the constant experimentation and adventurism for a more predictable, perhaps system-based approach to building offence, perhaps there's something even better than that in the cards.","Small, skilled offensive blueliner had an up and down season.  Strong skater with some dynamic qualities but needs some rounding out defensively.","Seamus Casey is an electrifying offensive defenseman who has the potential to go end-to-end every time the puck touches his stick. He has an extremely high ceiling and if he lives up to his potential, he could be one of the best offensive blueliners from the draft class. He has high-end skating ability, generating good speed with long and powerful strides. He loves to have the puck on his stick, driving transition play with his skating and puck-moving ability. He can manipulate the other team's defensive setup with his puck movement and his vision, creating quality passing lanes and exploiting them whenever they present themselves. He's the type of player who can run a top power play unit at the next level, not only because of his vision and passing but also because of his ability to get off shot attempts from the high-danger areas. His two-way game has really progressed as the season went on, but if there are any concerns about him, it's on the defensive side of the puck. He has the skating and the IQ to be an effective defender, but still has the tendency to become too focused on the puck, allowing his assignment to slip by him and get open for a high-quality scoring opportunity. The maturity he's shown throughout the season to continuously improve his defensive game is a big positive for his game, but it will be something he will want to work on. While he is a high-ceiling player, his floor may be lower than some of his teammates, which might give teams a bit of cause for concern in selecting him. But that ‘boom' potential will be really intriguing to a lot of NHL teams, too. If he pays off, Casey will end up being a top-four mainstay for whoever drafts him and a key cog on the power play."
2022,C,75,209,22,ANA,32,Nathan Gaucher,"Gaucher is a skilled and competitive center. He possesses a bulky 6-foot-3 frame and is a physical player which allows him to win a lot of puck battles. Gaucher creates a lot of offense around the net due to his physical tools. He's a responsible two-way player who can PK well. Offensively he's not flashy, but he has the hands to make plays inside the offensive zone. He creates a lot around the hard areas of the ice. He has a fluid stride, but lacks top-end speed and doesn't make a ton of plays. Gaucher projects as a third-line center who won't be a big scorer but will have significant two-way value.","Gaucher is a big, strong kid who can really build a head of steam (his feet can look heavy early in his acceleration patterns but when they even out and he gets going, he's fast) and push through the middle of the ice in transition or attack off the wall inside the offensive zone. At the junior level, there are games where he really imposes himself and just looks bigger and stronger than everyone else, combining his ability to drive with and without the puck to wreak havoc. But he has some touch and finishing ability too. So he'll play to the middle lane and jump defenders to the inside, but he'll also make his share of soft little plays to the middle off the wall as a passer, or rip a puck in from midrange. I see all of the pro tools that scouts love in him, but I just haven't been able to level them against his sub-point-per-game production as a third-year junior player, and I wonder if some of his strengths will be muted up levels. I understand while he'll probably go in the first round, and I think he's got a real chance to be an NHLer, but I'd be reluctant to take him there. I think too often players like Gaucher are viewed as the safer pick versus, say, a smaller kid like a Firkus, because of their size, and I think the reverse is often the case.",,"Though he lacks a dynamic element to his game, Gaucher has a lot of the tools you want to see in a middle-six center. He's big, he's strong and there's some real power in his game. While his skating lacks burst, I think he's got a powerful enough stride for it not to be an issue. He's committed on both sides of the puck and has enough offense to produce. He had 57 points including 31 goals in 66 QMJHL games this year. I do have some moderate concern about the skill level translating, but there's a lot of elements that Gaucher brings to the table that will help a team.","Gaucher brings a very north-south game with good speed, power and reasonable hands. Has a straightforward but underrated passing game, a very heavy release, and can bury players with his physicality. The upside is the question but the projectability is easy to see.","Every draft class features a handful of players that you can point to and confidently say they're destined for the NHL. Nathan Gaucher is one of them in this year's draft.
This is how Elite Prospects QMJHL scout  opened his profile on the Québec Remparts forward on EP Rinkside.
“The certainty of Gaucher's projection is the reason why we included him in our top-32 board this season. Few players possess his combination of power and speed, his physicality and motor. These attributes give Gaucher a stronger NHL foundation than most. On their own, they could earn him a long career in the top league – if he learns to maximize them.”
Gaucher is already a fierce forechecker, someone who can knock opponents on the boards, steal pucks from them, and protect them long enough to find an outlet with a deft backhand pass. Those passes were a trademark of Gaucher's game all season long. His ability to slip pucks around or under the stick of opponents to open teammates allowed his team to quickly transition the puck from zone to zone.
Gaucher also provides value in front of the net, where his imposing frame prevents goalies from tracking shots. With a little more technique and work on his hand-eye coordination, he could earn himself more than a few NHL goals by tipping shots every season.
“He was physical, intense on the forecheck, and screening goalies, almost scoring a couple more goals by getting his stick on rebounds,”  wrote in a late-season game report. “His constant pressure made the plays of Rimouski Ds quite difficult. His playmaking game shines when he has clear plays to make, but there are no high-level ideas here, no inclination to manipulate or control his speed, or leverage good scoring chances into great ones.”
Despite the lack of high-end playmaking and manipulation abilities in his game, his passing precision and ability to fire off passes still give Gaucher upside. If he can refine his timing and deception, he could become a mainstay on a top-6 line down the road, as a complementary forward, a puck-retriever, defensive presence, and finisher. While it's more likely that Gaucher ends up being moved to the wing due to his small-area skill-set, he could also hold on to a center position due to his ability as a quick distributor. ","Combination of size, strength, and skill makes Gaucher a potential first-round pick.  Considered by many to be a lower-risk pick and a potential middle-six forward.","Nathan Gaucher is a highly competitive two-way center who has a formidable frame and some good physical tools. He uses his big body effectively, throws his weight around, leans on opponents, has a rocket of a shot and some really nice touch around the net. He does it all in every situation. He's a beast on the cycle, can make the occasional sneaky pass and, while he doesn't string together a collection of maneuvers in sequence, his hands are decent enough to go forehand to backhand and show some patience to out-wait a goalie. He's a nightmare for defenders to face, as he's very comfortable with the puck on his stick while at top speed. When he wants access to a patch of ice there isn't much that stops him. He challenges opponents one-on-one, can drive to the net like he's skating downhill, shoot in-stride, or dip his shoulder and pull pucks around the defenseman. As an offensive net-front presence he is at an NHL level already. He creates screens and can slip away from defenders and find loose pucks and rebounds. He has no wasted movements or hesitation and the puck is on and off his stick in an instant. He comes back deep in his zone to support his defensemen, and he's really good at picking up speed behind the puck and gaining possession in full flight. Defensively, he puts in a lot of effort on the backcheck, takes away passing lanes and attempts to gain inside positioning. He can anticipate sudden changes in possession, defend the slot area and identify potential threats. Gaucher doesn't have a lot of glaring deficiencies but he would benefit from increased stride frequency. Continued skill development will show he's NHL potential as a second line center or first line winger."
2022,D,77.5,225,28,DAL,33,Lian Bichsel,"Bichsel's physical tools are quite evident. He's a 6-foot-5 defenseman who skates well for his size, is physical and has some offensive touch. He can carry and create through the neutral zone due to his feet and skills and shows some creativity from the offensive blue line. He has good hands but there isn't much playmaking or poise in his puck play. Defensively he's quite good due to his reach, feet and physicality. He closes gaps like a pro and can be trusted to play hard minutes as he advances levels. Bichsel projects as a top-four defenseman with the potential to play higher in a lineup if the offense translates.","Bichsel is a towering defenceman who moves well and showed well in the SHL this season before he suffered a concussion on a hit from behind in March which derailed the final stretch of his year and kept him out of U18 worlds (where he was expected to captain the Swiss). He's heaviest players in this draft, and because he doesn't lumber around and he's fairly comfortable carrying the puck (both in transition and across the line), there are teams that are prepared to bet on his upside in the first round. Bichsel defends the rush, the cycle and the net well, and that will always be his calling card. Some sloppiness can develop in his game when play caves in on him and pace ramps up though, and I worry about just how big he already is (225 pounds) and some of the challenges he might face if he ends up playing closer to 240 pounds (which isn't at all out of the question).",,"You can watch Bichsel for a matter of minutes and see the pro potential. He checked in at the combine at 6-foot-5.5 and 225 pounds and he knows how to use that frame. He defends very well and did so even against professionals this year, appearing in 29 SHL games this season. He was physically dominant and showed some better offensive tools at the U20 level, scoring seven points in 11 games in junior with Leksands this season. Bichsel dealt with some late-season injuries that prevented him from participating in a number of events including the U18 World Championship which surely could have aided his draft stock. Injuries aside, the upside of a player like Bichsel is pretty huge, especially at that size and with the physicality he plays with. The concern is if he thinks the game at a high enough level offensively to be more than a mobile defender with size and physicality. Picking him in the first round, you're betting on his ability to find it.",,"The first thing you'll notice with Lian Bichsel is his range.
Standing at a lanky 6-foot-5 with room to fill out, this Swiss
defenceman offers among the most enticing physical builds
from the blue line in this entire draft.
Don't let his profile fool you, though. Bichsel isn't just
some lumbering road paver from a bygone era. There's
some legitimate speed and skill at the Leksands blueliner's
disposal, even if he's still learning how best to put it to use.
His work on the breakout certainly stands out as built for
the modern NHL. He sends false signals going in for the
retrieval, swats away forechecking pressure as he explodes
into the middle of the ice, and then makes the best play
available to him. There's enough handling skill there to
sometimes manoeuvre past the forecheck, but most often,
he'll settle for a pass.
It is, however, worth noting just how uncomfortable Bichsel
often looked handling the puck along the boards. Getting
into space is vital for the Swiss blueliner to pull off even the
most basic handling moves.
That's less of a problem in the offensive zone. There's a
reason the Wolfwil-born defender finished the season tied
for first among first-time draft-eligible SHL defencemen in
points and led in points per game. ""Even in the SHL, Bichsel maximizes his odds of getting
the puck through activation and movement,"" Elite Prospects

open for one-timers closer to the net, and occasionally tries
to beat defenders with his hands. When combined with his
possession-maintaining pinches, he projects as an above-average

You're probably not drafting Bichsel to put up gaudy point
totals or quarterback a power play, though. His skill level is
probably sufficient to one day play in the middle of a team's

driver on his pairing.
Instead, his future is one that will see him as part of
his team's defensive conscience. A player who counts their
successes in the pucks kept from his net rather than those

Bichsel played in Sweden's top league last season and didn't look out of place.  While he may not have eye-dropping offensive skills, he makes an excellent first pass and has shown some offensive prowess at times.  He has an excellent first step and uses his combination of speed and size to his advantage in all situations.

Bichsel's season ended with a concussion, and scouts hope he will be able to bounce back.  His skill makes him a potential second-pairing defender at the NHL level.  ","Lian Bichsel is a physical freak with his impressive stature, and is already and playing meaningful minutes in a men's league in Sweden. His strength is arguably his best asset, as he has no issue boxing out older, stronger, more mature professionals in Sweden's top circuit. He makes it seem effortless at times. He is not one to just camp in front of the net, as he engages in board battles any chance he gets. Showing good defensive awareness, he scans the ice well and is ensuring no one gets behind him. With such a long reach, he is very good at challenging attackers and taking away space from them, forcing turnovers in the process. His gap control helps aid in his ability to defend the rush. He is not afraid to jump into the rush on the other end of things, and has shown some offensive instincts that haven't necessarily shown up on the scoresheet for him. There's some skating issues in his game that limit his overall upside. Lacking flex in his ankles, he struggles to generate full power and speed, especially while going backwards. This impacts his ability to prevent skaters from beating him wide with speed as his lateral mobility is also affected by this lack of speed. He could really benefit from working with a skating coach and changing his stance and stride. This would allow him to better leverage that length in his legs that are already very strong. There's definitely a ton of upside with him, as he looks every bit to be an NHL level defender. Slight improvements to his skating will only make him a more effective player who can drive positive impacts on possession and offensive zone shot attempts. At his peak, Bichsel will be a top-four blueliner who plays in every situation at the NHL level."
2022,D,72.25,188,65,NYI,34,Calle Odelius,"Odelius' skating pops out to you when you watch him. He has a powerful, fluid stride that can explode up the ice and the strong edge work to escape pressure. I wouldn't call his puck play as exceptional as his feet, but he shows good instances of puck skill and can make plays in the O-zone to create chances. He's talented, and the skating excites scouts, but as a 5-foot-11 defenseman who is average defensively and isn't dynamic offensively, I'm not sure where he fits on an NHL team.","Odelius is a steadying, calculating two-way defenceman who plays a head-on-a-swivel game built upon snuffing plays out defensively and advancing play back the other direction. He's not a dynamic on-puck carrier or creator in the offensive zone, but he's prolific at moving the puck from A to B either with precision first passes or comfortable north-south carrying. He's also got a strong, strong athletic foundation and a balanced skating posture (he's one of the better backwards skaters in the draft for me) that allows him to manage the rush, quickly move from accepting a pass into sending one while on the heels of his skates, and leverage his strong frame to its fullest in engagements. He doesn't project as a top-end player but his game's impressive control and efficiency could well make him an everyday NHL defenceman.","In my opinion, Odelius' floor is a second pairing defenseman at the NHL level. With his tool-set, he has proven that he can be a challenge in every zone with his vision and scanning abilities. As mentioned earlier, he reads puck movement well and knows just how many stride extensions it will take to get himself in position to defend. He can dictate what attackers do with the puck with his active stick. He can rely on his puck manipulation to garner enough space for him to escape pressure and net himself enough open ice to key up a quality passing lane leading to scoring opportunities. There is just so much in his game that will make him an asset at the next level. ","A smooth-skating two-way defenseman, Odelius put up strong numbers in Sweden's U20 league and got limited action in the top pro level. The tools are there for Odelius to be a higher-end defenseman in this class, but I have some concerns about his overall offensive upside and hockey sense. His reads and anticipation only looked OK to me in live viewings this year, but I think there's a foundation of skills that show NHL upside.",,"The list of defencemen who can move the puck and defend
more efficiently than Calle Odelius in this draft is a
short one, and you've already crossed their paths if you've
read the Elite Prospects 2022 NHL Draft Guide in the ranked
order of prospects.
He's a defensive defenceman for the modern NHL. Odelius'
preferred method is keeping the play out of his zone entirely.
With so much of the game dictated by what happens between
the blue lines, his quality as a rush defender really stands
out in this regard.
Odelius maintains a tight gap through the neutral zone
with his fluid backwards stride and ample four-way mobility,
warding play away from the middle with an active stick,
and closing with suddenness and force, always at the right
moment. Most forwards will settle for a dump-and-chase
play, and that's where their possession ends.
His retrievals start with a shoulder check for incoming
threats and options. Then Odelius layers deception on the first
touch before exploding out of his retrieval and into space.
He'll bait another forechecker into the zone if only to create
more of a numbers advantage up ice, and with his skating and handling skills, it almost always works.
Now, about that skating -- Elite Prospects Swedish regional
scout Jimmy Hamrin tagged Odelius' as an elite projection.
Few of his peers can cover ground as effortlessly as he does,
gliding from one zone to the next with equal parts power
and grace.
Often, though, Odelius would move the puck with a wellplaced,
well-weighted pass. It was a little bit like watching
a veteran NFL quarterback go through his progressions in
the pocket as he scanned the surface for options further upice.
Where some players settle for the first player available
to them, Odelius would almost always go through his reads
until he found the best one.
Unfortunately, the one thing Odelius failed to bring to the
offensive zone was much in the way of offensive instincts
or production. He's a mover in the offensive zone but not
much of a creator. For all his four-way mobility, the Swedish
blueliner often had to rely on cutbacks and spins rather than
outside edge moves, limiting his options at the top of the zone.
There is some belief or at the very least some optimism
among our staff that Odelius' mobility, poise, and occasional flashes of deception will one day make him a relatively productive
player in the NHL. But that's hardly a given at this
stage. Not something you can bank on, anyway.
We've no such qualms with his in-zone defensive play,
though. A highly engaged off-puck defender who stays a step
ahead of the game with constant scanning -- Odelius nips
plays in the bud before they even have a chance to develop.
There's no doubt that we're sticking our neck out a fair
bit for this player. Odelius is barely even clinging to the first round of our consolidated rankings in the Elite Prospects
Draft Center, and only because of our vote of confidence in
the form of a spot in the teens on our board.
Time will tell who's right, but we expect Odelius to be the
defensive conscience of a second pair at the NHL level and
bring high-end if not elite puck-moving skill to the table.
Who knows, maybe a little offence, too. You get that player
in the teens, and that's a win every time.","Elite skating defender has some strong offensive tools and isn't a defensive liability.  Overall upside may be limited, making him a likely second rounder rather than a first.","Calle Odelius is a very steady defenseman who acts as a calming presence on the back end due to how well he's able to control the game and play position. There's no hesitation in his game when he has the puck on his stick, as he always knows what he wants to do with it. He does well in his own end to quickly move the puck out of danger, keeping his head on a swivel and making good, hard passes to clear it. This processing of the ice around him before getting the puck on his stick is something he does at a high level and prepares him for what's coming next. He is capable of carrying the puck up ice but, he will not force it if a lane isn't there – instead opting to make a crisp pass to a teammate in a better position. In general, his decision-making is very consistent regardless of where he is on the ice. Playing with a high effort level, he defends really well and understands his assignments. By playing physical when necessary, he is able to pin opponents along the boards and retrieve the puck. He could box out better, positioning himself between the opponent and the puck. He does not have a ton of offense to his game as he lacks the high-end creativity to set up prime scoring chances. With how well rounded he is, he's got an excellent chance of making it to the NHL but he is definitely one of the safer picks available, albeit with a lower ceiling than most of the higher-end options available. Given the range where he is likely to go, a team can't go wrong with a defensive prospect this polished and mature. This class is loaded with defensive prospects, especially in the first few rounds, but Odelius deserves to have his name in the conversation among the upper-echelon blueliners available early the second round."
2022,C,71.25,187,33,MON,35,Owen Beck,"Beck brings an intriguing amount of speed and skill to his shifts. He has NHL-level skating and is able to make highly-skilled plays through checks at full speed. He shows the ability to be able to set up his teammates well while also being able to finish in tight or from the circles. Beck isn't the biggest forward, but he competes well, can PK and doesn't shy from getting inside by using his speed. He projects as a top-nine forward, likely on the wing.","Beck is a strong, athletic kid who has endeared himself to scouts for his middle-lane, driven, pro-style game and plus-level speed. He didn't produce enough, for me, this year to earn the first-round rating that some in the public and private spheres have given him, but he's a noticeable shift-to-shift player who excels at getting to the inside, pushing tempo, and winning battles. And there is skill to his game (he's got good hands and enough talent to make things happen when he's around the puck all the time) even if it fits within more of a hurry-up style than a slow-the-game-down-and-problem-solve one. He can play in all situations with a variety of linemate types and projects as a third-line player who can play up and down a lineup where needed.","I'll start with the summary before going into a longer explanation: conservatively I think he's a third line center who can positively impact transition numbers and generate more chances than his line will give up. 

I think there's a lot to unpack with Owen Beck, though. While his skill isn't super flashy; it is highly effective. He processes the game so well and so fast that he's able to move pucks to highly effective scoring areas quickly whether that's on his stick or with a one-touch pass. 

The elephant in the room is that the first line center on Mississauga is a 2022 draft eligible as well in Luca Del Bel Belluz. Owen Beck isn't seeing the power play time that Del Bel Belluz is, nor does he have a line-mate that is as prolific a scorer as James Hardie. While this hurts his overall point production; I do think it has helped Beck develop as he's the focal point of the second line.

One of the biggest parts of projecting Owen Beck will be the maturation of his ability to use his skill and speed to keep the puck on his stick when entering the offensive zone. A lot of the clips shown are with the puck on his stick, but what has not been shown is that a lot of his transitions are done with him giving up the puck to a teammate to enter the zone. I think for him to generate more offensive chances (and to generate a higher point production) he's going to have to keep the puck on his stick longer so that he's the primary setup man in a chain-link play and not the catalyst that jump starts it. 

I'm personally a bit more bullish on Owen Beck than some. Players that drive play through entries/exits will always have a positive bias from me. I think there's a possibility that he could reach a ceiling of being a two-way, second line center. Until he's given the opportunity to have top-line minutes and given ample power play time it's hard for me to really project what his offensive ceiling could be as I think he has the talent to be a top-end offensive producer in the OHL, but the opportunity to be one isn't there. 

There is a strong likelihood that Beck will most likely be a backend 1st round pick to the middle of the second round pick in the 2022 NHL draft, and it wouldn't surprise me to see him as one of the steals of the second round when it's all said and done.","A solid two-way player that brings good effort to every shift, Beck has good physical strength in an average-sized frame. He has strength on pucks and plays with enough skill to create. He never shies away from traffic and can get through it with a combination of skill and brawn. There's not a ton of flash to his skill, but he continues to make plays consistently. He had 51 points in 68 games during the regular season and played pretty substantial minutes. I think he could be a solid middle-of-the-lineup player.",,"Don't let Owen Beck's modest statistical profile fool you
– he's the real deal. In a league where many first-time drafteligible
skaters failed to find their game or maintain a high
level of play for more than a few games at a time, Beck was
the model of consistency. Points be damned.
It was the keen eye of our OHL regional scout Lauren Kelly
who cut through the noise of his good-not-great boxcar stats
and found the signal of his true talent level. And the more
scouts we assigned crossover work on this file, the better
the esteem in which we held him as a group.
The first thing that stands out with Beck is just how wellrounded
his tools are. Every one of them is an average-toabove-
average NHL projection, if not better. They're never
going to drive gaudy, jaw-dropping offensive totals, but they
should prove adequate even as the talent pool compresses
around Beck at higher levels of competition.
His most impressive tool of the bunch is probably his
skating stride. It was good enough to earn a 6 grade on our
1-to-9 linear scale and provided the basis for exceptionally
strong transition results in the OHL last season. In the
sample of data that Elite Prospects Dir. of North American
Scouting Mitch Brown tracked from the 2021-22 CHL and
USHL seasons, Beck rated in the 98th percentile for transition
results.
""Beck's speed overwhelms defenders,"" Kelly wrote in a Film
Room breakdown of Beck's game. ""He's a powerful skater with a good mix of crossovers and gets to his top speed
quickly. He uses that speed to back defenders up and even
rush right past them on some sequences.
Beck uses that speed to provide constant support at every
corner of the ice. He's the ultimate play connector, always
offering his teammates a passing option and showing a great
knack for linking defence to offence.
Beck isn't a high-end playmaker, though, lacking some
of the pro-level concepts that would make him a real force
in this regard -- specifically, manipulation. Still, his ability
to funnel pucks inside from the boards or find teammates through traffic was a consistent theme in our viewings this
season. It's probably an average projection.
Mostly, the Steelheads forward uses the threat of the pass
and the give-and-go to create shooting opportunities; as a
means to get inside and let his shot take care of the rest.
And with a wide array of releases for any situation, he's
well-equipped to take advantage of every chance his inside
movements create for himself.
Perhaps the best part of Beck's projection, though, is
his defensive work. He's an urgent, engaged defender who
understands defensive rotations and never cheats to create
offence. His off-puck reads are remarkably strong for a
player at this stage in their development, and they allow
him to force turnovers with stunning regularity. If nothing
else, there's definitely a future as a defensive specialist in
the cards for this player. The question for many at this point in his scouting report
is probably why he wasn't more productive or held in better
esteem by our peers in the public sphere. We can't speak
to the latter item, but we have a theory about the former.
Basically, it's a combination of poor finishing luck -- onice
and personal -- and not exactly being put in a position
to succeed offensively in Mississauga. Now, the data may
not bear out the former theory to the degree we'd like, but
anecdotally, our viewings bear this out -- just read his game
reports if you're still skeptical on this file.
We suspect that the production will come and that Beck
will bring more than enough skill to hang in a top-nine role
at the NHL level. There isn't likely an Art Ross Trophy in
his future, but coaches are going to love having this player
in their lineup. That counts for a lot.","Owen Beck has drawn comparisons to Anthony Cirelli at times this season.  Any team that picks a player like Beck would love to have a player of that skillset at the NHL level.

Beck is a strong two-way forward.  He excels at faceoffs and in defensive shut down situations.  He is an excellent skater and highly competitive.  Some scouts question Beck's offensive ceiling, but he still managed to put up 51 points while playing some of the toughest minutes of any player in the OHL this season.  Beck's offensive opportunities will likely increase next season and he has some strong offensive tools that could translate well to the next level.

If everything comes together for Beck, he projects as a middle-six forward at the NHL level.  He is likely 3-4 years away from competing for a full-time NHL spot.","Owen Beck is a two-way center who excels at taking time and space away from his opponents while showing the ability to be a skilled puck-carrier and offensive threat. His ability to play excellent positional hockey and anticipate the play allows him to read the opponent's eyes and jump on the plays as they develop. After he creates turnovers he has the ability to quickly transition to offense, while he doesn't possess elite speed he can is more than capable of creating separation for himself on offense. Offensively, he doesn't do anything at an elite level but he can read plays well, has quality puck sills that will allow him to be a consistent contributor at the next level and has the ability to chip in and help drive the bus in the transition game. His bread an butter is his IQ and his ability to read plays, and if he ever gets his skill level to come anywhere close to his mind, he can turn into an elite player. He is the type of player that all coaches will love to have on their team, as he has the skillset to play multiple roles and in multiple situations. He has the skillset to be a contributor on the power play, and the work ethic to be a key cog of the penalty kill. He may never be an elite offensive producer, but he will be able to consistently put up respectable numbers while having great underlying impacts on a nightly basis. If there were any concerns with his game, it's that he could already be close to his ceiling. He's the perfect high-floor prospect. If you draft him you know you're getting an NHL-caliber player who will be a vital member of your middle-six forward group for the next decade, but where in that range he slots will be the question, as there might not be any more upside than that range to Beck's game."
2022,D,73.5,189,53,ANA,36,Tristan Luneau,Luneau's strengths come with the puck on his stick. He's a very smart puck-moving defenseman with a solid skill level. He has the vision and poise to make great outlets and find seams in the offensive zone. Luneau shows the stick skills to put pucks through legs on occasion. He lacks speed to rush pucks but his stick and brain let him transition well. He also has a hard point shot allowing him to be dangerous on the power play. His skating leads to some defensive issues and he may need to be a guy in the NHL who doesn't take tough matchups. I think he will play in the NHL but he may need to be used in a specific way.,"Luneau was the first pick in the 2020 QMJHL draft and looked like a surefire first-rounder through the Youth Olympics (where he was an alternate captain) and into his strong rookie season in the QMJHL (where he won the league's defensive rookie of the year award). And while it took him some time to get back to that status after a knee procedure cost him his summer, his preseason, and the first three games of the regular season, he hit his stride in the second half and into Gatineau's two-round playoff run, logging huge all situations minutes and contributing offensively while playing a matchup role against the opposition's best. Luneau's game isn't dynamic, but he's a smooth-skating (without being explosive, something some scouts worry about) right-shot defenceman who can competently run a power play, is a plus-level passer, has developed his shot into more of a weapon, and reads the play at as high a level as just about any defenceman in the draft (with and without the puck at both ends). He plays a cerebral two-way game that lends itself to driving play. And while he's a high-floor, low-ceiling type, his size, maturity, roundedness and discreet offensive game and skating (both of which I expect will show themselves more next season with full health and a summer of steady training) should make him an efficient, all-purpose guy. ","If Luneau works on his skating and keeps a conservative strategy when controlling the puck, I believe that his projection is a third pairing defenseman. But, if Luneau can adopt a more creative style to puck control, grow his scanning abilities and further develop his skating, his upside only trends upwards. I just want to see Luneau attack in the offensive zone with passes to medium and high danger. While Luneau does pass to medium and high danger, he doesn't do it with much regularity. He needs to continue to grow his puck manipulation to open up space for himself and not revert to low danger shots. I'd like to see him grow more of an inside game and challenge more. If he does do so, then second pairing upside is possible. ","With 43 points in 63 QMJHL games this season, Luneau continued on the path of showcasing he can be a solid two-way defenseman. His offensive tools are better than what he does defensively. The more I watched Luneau this season, I just felt like there was good-enough offensive skill and adequate defending. He did everything at a level that didn't strike me as truly elite or high-end, but he did a lot of things well. ",,"We had high expectations for Tristan Luneau coming
into the season, hoping that we would see nothing short of
offensive dominance at the QMJHL level.
To some degree, we got that from the Gatineau Olympiques
defenceman. He continued to show the same agility and
ability to feint and pass around opponents this season. His
elusive skating moves were especially effective on regroups
and at the point in the offensive zone, where opponents came
at him with speed. With heel-to-heels and spins, Luneau
easily outmaneuvered them to attack or pass down the ice.
Much of his production came from his ability to create
offensive zone entries and passes to teammates around the
net. That said, his breakout game left us wanting more. His
offensive zone playmaking never translated to that aspect of
the game. With his back turned to forechecking pressure, as
he retrieved a puck, Luneau seemed to lose his composure.
Quite often, he defaulted to rims and chips off the glass,
even with open teammates ready for a pass in the middle
of the ice.
While Luneau is very agile, his speed and quickness
ranked significantly below average this season; his heavier
stride didn't allow him to create as much separation from
opponents. Once he slowed down to get a puck on the back
wall of the defensive zone, his escape routes became more
limited. But Luneau's lesser offensive showing this season
can't all be attributed to mechanical and decision-making
problems, he also seemed to purposely scale back that facet
of his game this season in favour of developing a more sound
defensive game.
“This was one of the most physical and defensively engaged
performances I've seen from Luneau,” Elite Prospects
QMJHL scout David St-Louis wrote on March 19th, 2022. 'It
may have had to do with this game being the first of Ève
Gascon in the Gatineau Olympiques uniform. He defended
the front of the net fiercely, ramming and shoving opposing
attackers away from her sight.”
If Luneau continues to hone his off-puck plays and improves
the efficiency of his forward stride, he could find a
role as a bottom-pairing defenceman in the NHL in a few
years. His agility and playmaking talent could lend themselves
to a power play role, too.",Two-way defender has some questions regarding offensive upside.  Overall has a solid toolkit and is likely to play NHL games.,"Tristan Luneau is a calm and self-assured defender that exudes confidence in all three zones. His skating is silky smooth with fluid four-way mobility, good speed in transition, and the agility to manage pressure and escape into open ice. Slick hands, strong and accurate passing, and great vision allow him to initiate zone exits, move pucks through the neutral zone and gain the offensive blue line. He can quarterback a power play, get shots to the net, shield pucks from the opposition and prolong offensive zone possession. In his own end, his positioning is first-rate and, although he isn't one to run around and bang into anything that moves, he can rub guys out along the wall, battle for pucks, and play a smart physical game when that is called for. He can be expected to continue to refine the little details of his play. His hockey IQ is already high, but that will naturally continue to develop as he matures. His speed, specifically his quickness over short distances, is something that he is likely to address. Directional changes, especially in his pivots, are a little choppy and he loses power in his stride due to being a little too upright in his stance. A correction would help make him more effective. Having said that, all the elements of a premier defenseman are in place and, while he doesn't come with a top-pair guarantee, he is certainly not a gamble either. How well and how much of his skillset he can transfer to the next level will determine where he fits into the lineup, but there is little doubt that he is a future NHL defenseman. A team wanting to add a sound two-way game to their back end with offensive upside and the potential to blossom into a steady fixture on their top unit could see Luneau as exactly what they're looking for."
2022,C,72.5,179,44,CBJ,37,Luca Del Bel Belluz,"Del Bel Belluz is a very skilled center with decent size. He has the crafty puck skills to manipulate the puck in tight areas and often shows he can beat defenders one on one. He can run a power play off the flank due to his very good vision and shot although I don't see that as his role in the NHL. He lacks foot speed for the higher levels, but he works hard enough and provides some two-way value down the middle. He projects as a top-nine forward. With his feet, he may struggle to stick at center but if he does it's on the third line.","Del Bel Belluz is a player I've struggled to wrap my head around this year. When I've watched him, I haven't been able to counterbalance what I've seen against his strong production and No. 8 ranking among North American skaters by NHL Central Scouting. He's got some good tools in isolation, which reveal themselves a few times a game, whether that's a slight pre-pre-shot deception in his release that can fool goalies, his quick hands, or his soft skills in execution when there's a play to be made. And while I think his skating is a little better than he gets credit for, slowish feet combine with a game that too often doesn't fit together in the whole, and his Nov. 2003 birthday, to leave me unconvinced about what exactly he'll be at the next level. Or whether he's capable of taking the steps forward that most of his peers will in junior to reach beyond where he's presently at (concerns which were reinforced in a disappointing playoffs).","Luca Del Bel Belluz is one of the more intriguing prospects slated to go in the top 100 selections at this summer's NHL Draft in Montreal. There's just so many aspects of his overall game that are incredibly talented. He's been viewed up and down many scouts ranking lists, finding himself anywhere from a late first round pick, to an early third round pick.

Personally, I think there's a lot to love about his game. First, offensively he is one of the most talented passers and stick-handlers in the entire draft. His ability to take on multiple opponents alone when his teammates are changing and often come out successfully with the puck is impressive. Arguably one of my favourite clips of his, Del Bel Belluz picks up the puck in the corner and works his way to the right circle. He absolutely walks Shane Wright, eludes Matthew Soto, and puts a beautiful pass on the tape of Evan Brand for the first goal of the game. Del Bel Belluz' hockey IQ is on full display there, as he's able to turn a loose puck from the corner into a highlight reel play, solely based off how well he's able to think the game, and execute.

Not only that, but he's able to create a fair amount of time and space in the offensive zone several times per game by eluding the defender with a beautiful deke. This trait allows him to put the other highly regarded aspects of his offensive game to work, by shooting or passing to a teammate for a chance on net.

Defensively, it's a thing of beauty to see the progress he's made in such a short time being able to play in all situations and be relied upon to be as effective in the defensive zone as he is in the offensive zone. It's evident he's working on becoming a 200ft player as he's able to get up the ice to attack and back-check to defend at the same rate of speed and urgency.

It's hard to pinpoint just exactly where Del Bel Belluz will be selected when the NHL Draft rolls around, but it wouldn't come as a surprise to see a team with multiple first round picks take a swing at him with their later selection(s). Also, if there's a specific team out there without multiple first round selections, it's just as likely to see him be selected within the first half of the second round.","You can't deny Del Bel Belluz's hands because he has some slippery puck skills. He's especially good at getting through the neutral zone and keeping plays alive in transition, making it tough for defenders to keep track of both him and where everyone else is on the ice. I think his skating is probably the one major drawback in his game at this point. It's average for me but not irreconcilable. He had 76 points in 68 games this season after not playing anywhere in 2020-21 and only had six points as a rookie back in 2019-20. Seeing his progression as well as his legitimate puck skills and great shot, I think there's a case for him to be a good middle-six scorer at the next level if he hits all his marks along the way.",,"Most goal-scorers are streaky, and Luca Del Bel Belluz is
no exception to the rule.
He scored at a torrid pace for most of the season. His 29
markers in the first 53 games positioned himself for a finish
inside the top-10 in goal-scoring in the OHL, but then the
goals abruptly went away as the calendar turned to March
and the games started to become more competitive. Del Bel
Belluz only scored twice in his final 25 games of the season,
playoffs included.
Despite the long cold streak, Del Bel Belluz's scoring talent
is not in doubt for us. We have come to respect his shooting
talent, specifically his ability to chain dangles into top-corner
bombs from the slot. His release contains both power and
precision. He knows how to set it up by attacking pockets
of space in high-danger areas.
The issue with Del Bel Belluz's game is one of translatability.
His skating and low pace of play, both in terms of movement
and speed of decisions, limit his upside. His high-stance
striding affects his ability to handle, to spot options, to get
to the right spot to create plays, his puck protection… every
facet of his game.
“He's clearly an intelligent, creative offensive player,” Elite
Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting Mitch Brown wrote
on April 1st, 2022. “Skating improvement would completely
overhaul his game, but (...) few players have overcome
skating deficiencies this significant.”
Del Bel Belluz has top-six upside, but he will need to work
with a talented skating coach to bring out his best at the
NHL level.",Had a strong offensive season.  Possesses strong offensive instincts.  Skating needs some improvement.,"Luca Del Bel Belluz is an intelligent, two-way attacker with an all-around offensive tool kit that he combines with a strong 200-foot game. He's a multi-dimensional offensive threat and has the ability to read and react in both the transition game and out of the cycle. His IQ at both ends of the ice allows him to consistently position himself in the correct spot to get off a quick shot or deliver a simple pass that sets up a teammate. His size is a plus for him and, while he's not the strongest player right now, he will likely grow and add more weight to his frame which will allow him to become more effective in the 50/50 puck battles that are crucial to retaining possession for his team. He's the type of player that makes his teammates better just by stepping on the ice. He doesn't do anything at an elite level, but he's so good at so many different things that he's tough to defend against and can consistently generate offensive chances. The concerns surrounding him will be around his ceiling and ability to perform at a consistent level once he makes the jump to the professional ranks. He had a solid season in the OHL and has the tools to be a solid contributor at the NHL level, but his lack of any elite skill and an upright and choppy skating stride which limits his acceleration and top-end speed could hold him back once he plays against tougher competition. He has the ability to be a middle-six forward if he hits his ceiling, who can play in all situations and bring lineup versatility to the organization that drafts him. There has been talk about Del Bel Belluz sneaking his way into the first round, but if he doesn't go on Day One, he will be a hot commodity to be plucked early on the second day of the draft."
2022,D,69,165,45,SJS,38,Mattias Havelid,Havelid is a talented offensive player from the back end. He has the skating ability to jump into attacks and activate off the blue line to create offense with his skill. Havelid can find seams and create with his playmaking consistently. He also has a hard point shot and scored a lot of goals this season. The major drawback on Havelid is his frame. Not many 5-foot-9 defensemen play in the NHL. He defends well and has been great at retrievals in junior but whether he will versus men is the debate. Due to how well he skates I think he will make it and play games.,"Havelid's a small defender whose defensive game doesn't come with the deficiencies that you might expect it would. He's proficient at everything, the kind of player who knows who he is, plays within himself, and always looks like the game is being played in front of him. He plays tight gaps, he's confident in control, he's got great poise on both sides of the puck, and everything is executed cleanly and decisively. He knows when to pick his spots to attack and then has the tools (including a great wrister) to make things happen. He never looks like he's scrambling or having to think out there. He's a well-rounded, effective and ultimately impactful defenceman. I don't think he's a defenceman that coaches are going to see as small.","With really only his size and a few smaller issues to clean up across the rest of his game, Havelid has a good chance to be an NHL player down the line. Upside wise there will likely be very few defensemen, if any, potentially available after the end of the first round who have what it takes to be better than the young Swede. If everything goes well development wise he could round out into a good number three NHL defenseman who can quarterback a top power-play unit. Furthermore, even if he simply keeps developing at a solid pace he could maybe find a home in the NHL as a #4-5 defenseman who can drive play and pick up points.","The son of former NHLer Niclas Havelid, Mattias and twin brother Hugo were huge pieces of Sweden's gold medal run at the U18 World Championship. It was also there that Mattias got to show what he looks like at the top of his game. A crafty skater with excellent edges and an ability to escape pressure, Havelid can make a lot of plays with his feet. He has a good shot and makes solid reads, aiding the transition and setting up chances for his teammates in the offensive zone. He had one of the most productive U18 tournaments by a defenseman in the tournament's history with 12 points, but he checks in at around 5-foot-10 and there are certainly some concerns about his lack of effectiveness at the professional level this season. There's a lot of physical development that has to happen, but I have a lot of faith in his skating and hockey sense to allow him to be an offensive mid-pairing defender at the NHL level if his development ticks up in the next season or two.",,"You'd never guess it based on Mattias Havelid's place in
each of our four rankings this season, but he was one of
the most challenging evaluations in the class. We went back
and forth on his game from our first board to our last, but
never enough to move the Linköping blueliner from his
perch in the mid-20s.
Ultimately, we felt that was a worthy compromise that
represented a middle-ground between the immense upside
Havelid flashed at times this year and the challenges he'll
face as a 5-foot-10 defenceman in the rough and tumble
NHL. A way to split the difference between his electric back
half of the year and his so-so start.
The draw here is obvious. You watch one Havelid game,
and you get it – It's the shot and hands combo that makes
him one of the draft's most potent offensive defencemen. If
you caught him at the 2022 U18 World Hockey Championship,
you saw the Swedish blueliner leverage those tools for four
goals in only six contests en route to the gold medal and
tournament All-Star honours.
It wasn't just by the force of his release, though. Havelid
showcased many projectable elements in the way that he
set up each shooting opportunity, whether it was creating
shooting lanes with deception and four-way mobility or
improving the chances on each shot by attacking down into
open space. puts up a hat-trick with three amazing goals,"" Elite Prospects
Swedish regional scout Jimmy Hamrin wrote in an April game
report. ""The first one was a hard one-time slapper from the
left circle on the power play. The second was a deke and
shot from the point. And the third goal was a top corner
angle shot down on the rush. All three goals displayed his
excellent shot in three different ways.""
Our only real qualm with his shot is the way Havelid leans
on that one skill, often to the detriment of his team's offensive
output. It wasn't uncommon for the Taby-born Swede to
miss passing options to wind up for a low-percentage bomb
from the point.
That isn't for lack of passing skill or vision, though. Havelid
consistently displayed the ability to find the best option on
the breakout rather than settling for the first one available
to him, and never had any issue getting that player the puck.
The hope, on our part, is that this passing skill will become
more of a feature of his in-zone offensive profile as he works
his way up to the NHL.
For those within the NHL, the main concern with Havelid
is his skating stride. You know the old saying. You can be
small, and you can be a poor skater, but you can't be both
and hope to play in the NHL, and so on. It's not a weakness
of his, by any stretch of the imagination, but even our staff
has gone back and forth on whether it's an average or aboveaverage
projection. If you're a team side scout who holds it as an average projection, well, that could make all the
difference in where he lands on your board.
There's also the defensive side of the game to consider, and
Havelid is probably an about average player in that regard,
too. He empties the tank on every shift and isn't afraid to
play the body, even against men as a diminutive 18-year-old.
The reads aren't always there, though.
Those defensive and skating-related concerns are the
reasons you probably won't see Havelid walk the stage on
Day 1 at the draft, but he could be an early Day 2 pick.
There's going to be some team out there who shares our
assessment that he could be an offensive defenceman with
transition value in the middle of a team's depth chart, and
they'll happily make that bet.","Another small blueliner, Havelid put up high point totals at the under 18's.  Can run a powerplay and contribute offensively.","Mattias Havelid is an undersized, smooth-skating defenseman with the capabilities to be a dynamic blueliner at the NHL level. Havelid is on the smaller side of things, but can make up for his lacking frame in a variety of ways. Most notably, his skating could be among the best for draft-eligible defenders. This ability is best seen when walking the offensive blue line with ease. From there, he has a developed offensive skillset. He has a quality wrist shot, which can score or allow a rebound for his teammates to pounce on. His vision is also superb. At both even-strength and as a power play quarterback, he can fire off solid passes to the tape of teammate's sticks. He also succeeds as a catalyst for offensive transitions. His vision and skating afford him opportunities to make strong breakout passes or carry the puck himself in order to set up possession in the offensive zone. In the defensive zone, there's concerns. He physically takes up less space and has a shorter reach than the majority of defensemen available in this draft class. His mobility and skating skills make him a decent defender against opposing rushes, and he manages gaps well, but he has to go about positioning over strength in all situations. He must improve his board battles. Even against fellow junior players, he is too often outmuscled in 50/50 situations. He can also be passive in these battles, in instances when he could have made a large impact on the play. He is a terrific offensive talent with great upside who must develop a stronger defensive game in order to rise the ranks of professional hockey and outdo the normal expectations set for a short blueliner. Still, there's plenty to like in the package Havelid does currently possess."
2022,C,70.25,175,61,SEA,39,David Goyette,"Goyette is a talented forward. He has strong speed and puck skills, showing the ability to transition pucks like a pro. Goyette displays good creativity off the rush and can make tough plays with pace. His work ethic is up and down for me. Some days I find him too perimeter and on others I see him engaged in battles and being a factor on the ice consistently. I think he'll play games but he'll need to be more consistent to become a reliable top-nine forward.","If you've followed my work this season, you'll know that Goyette has been maybe my favourite prospect in the draft since blowing me away in Calgary at Hockey Canada's summer showcase. He's an impressive athlete. He's a beautiful, effortless skater with a flowing stride who catches and handles pucks with ease at speed. He tries (and executes) difficult plays offensively with his hands by finessing pucks under sticks, through feet and into space for himself. He stays on pucks inside the offensive zone by keeping his feet moving to get to 50/50 pucks first or get up and under sticks and push through board battles to extend sequences.

He can beat defenders one-on-one to create for himself by pulling them to the inside and beating them with a cut back out wide, or just by going right into coverage. He can draw them in so that he can feed pucks into soft spots in coverage for his linemates. There's just a breeziness to his game that is hard to find. I suspect he'll be a value pick in the late first round or early second round after his meteoric second-half rise was stunted by an up-and-down U18 worlds (a tournament I'd argue he was under-utilized in). Look for him to follow a similar path to that of recent post-draft breakout junior stars like Philip Tomasino and Connor McMichael (he actually reminds a little of the former).",,"A good skater and highly skilled player, Goyette is able to dart through opposing defenses and create havoc in the offensive zone. Consistency and a lack of strength are notable areas in need of improvement in his game and sometimes his compete level wanes. There's a good ceiling there based on the skills, but in live viewings this year I was always left wanting more.",,"This was a tale of two seasons for David Goyette, almost
perfectly aligned with the calendar. In 2021, he scored just
four times in 23 games. In 2022, he scored 29 goals in 41
games, to go along with an equally impressive 25 assists.
The massive shift in goal-scoring isn't solely percentages.
Early in the season, Elite Prospects OHL Scout Lauren Kelly
noted, “he doesn't recognize space in the offensive zone, and
when he does, he's late.” During the hot streak, it became
clear that Goyette's awareness of pockets of space and lanes
improved. “His off-puck offence looked solid, anticipating
passes and finding space to get scoring chances of his own,”
Kelly wrote in a February game report.
The goal-scoring potential, however, isn't even Goyette's
most exciting skill – it's passing. He's always looking for the
high-value play, connecting with cross-slot passes through
layers and backhand passes from the boards. At his best, he
delays for the trailer, makes quick touch plays to fast-moving
teammates, and deceives defenders to prolong passing lanes.
Building upon those flashes could bump his passing grade up.
Goyette's also a dexterous, imaginative puckhander,
effortless sliding through defenders. However, it's the same
handling skill that produces the first area for improvement
in his game.
“Goyette tends to kill plays by overusing his hands; he
attacks packs of defenders and loses the puck,” Elite Prospects
Lead Scout David St-Louis explained in an April game report.
Concerns of Goyette's inconsistent scanning, loose defensive
game, lack of manipulation, slow decision-making along the
boards, and inconsistent use of body positioning are shared
across our scouting staff.
There's no doubt that Goyette has the puck skills to make
this ranking look silly, but the present make-up of his game
shares many commonalities with Quad-A players of years
prior. If he uses his tools to manipulate defenders instead
of trying to force his way through, he could become a topnine
forward.","I've been high on Goyette all season and my opinion of him hasn't changed given his high point totals and his strong overall play this season.  Goyette's biggest asset is his skating.  He has an effortless stride and can fly up and down the ice with ease.  He also put up decent point totals, showing an ability to create offense.

Goyette struggled at times at the Under-18s, which dropped his stock a bit amongst scouts.  While there aren't questions about his skating, there are some about his offensive ceiling.  In the OHL, Goyette can blow by opponents and score off the rush.  Will he be able to do this at the NHL level?  Likely not with the same ease, and he may struggle with the physicality based on his slight frame.

That being said, there is a lot to like about this player.  Even if he doesn't become a top-six forward, he can still contribute up and down a lineup.  My guess is he will likely be taken in the second round.  Regardless, he looks like a solid middle-six forward prospect.  He is 3-4 years away from NHL duty.

","David Goyette is a two-way winger with high-end speed who gets involved in the offense and is still the first one back when the play goes the other way. His stride is characterized by a deep knee bend, strong leg and arm drive, and a quiet upper-body. His skating allows him to effectively drive transition when he's on the ice. He's calm under pressure and has the ability to carve through the neutral zone with his skating. He makes quick and easy entry passes, allowing his team to gain entry to the offensive zone with full control of the puck. He has solid puck skills, possessing the ability to be an adequate facilitator, but he's at his best when he uses his shot. He has solid shooting mechanics, allowing him to release the puck off his stick quickly. He generates a lot of power and accuracy when he pulls the trigger, and there's little hesitation to do so. He will want to add some strength to his frame as he progresses towards the professional ranks because there are times opponents can easily knock him off the puck and strip him of possession. He also has a tendency to be too passive and wait for the perfect play. There are times he skates himself into trouble waiting for a perfect lane rather than taking what the defense gives him and making the simple play. He's the type of player that can drive play whenever he is on the ice, so if he can work on becoming more confident and more willing to take what's presented in front of him as opposed to waiting for the perfect play, he will become a much more effective player. Goyette won't have to wait too long before hearing his name called, and whoever drafts him will get a player that can eventually slot into their middle-six and play multiple situations at the next level.

"
2022,D,70,196,68,SEA,40,Ty Nelson,"Nelson brings a lot of pace to his shifts. He's an excellent skater who can generate a lot of controlled exits and entries due to his skating. He has good enough skill to carry and create offense, and displays good poise as a passer. Nelson's biggest issue is his frame as he barely measures at 5-foot-10, but he's a highly competitive player who can land surprising hits for his size. He has a chance but given he's not that dynamic offensively and undersized he's not a sure thing to make it.","A No. 1 pick into the OHL himself, Nelson has always been a draw for his offensive skill. But he's also a stocky, athletic kid who is the most physically well-built prospect I've come across in this draft class. There's some risk-taking that comes with his game but as he learns to simplify a bit, he's got the makings of both a modern and throwback D (he does not shy away physically despite his size). His head is always up, his shot pops and he's not afraid to use it. He's eager to activate up ice and join the rush or lead a transition sequence, he side-steps pressure with ease, and while I wouldn't say he's fast, his stride is compact and balanced through forward and backwards pushes and aggressive and almost choppy through his crossovers (in part because of how darn big and strong he is for his size). He more than held his own defensively this season, too, which bodes well for his ability to translate the rest of his game up levels. There were times this season where I actually wanted him to play a little looser and attacking because I think he's capable of even more offensively than his 61 points in 79 games already reveal, but some of that is the system they play in North Bay.

Here's how Nelson describes himself: “I'm a two-way defenceman. I love to play in the offensive zone and control the pace of the game. I'm the power-play quarterback but I can also be the shutdown defenceman and block a shot when needed and take a hit to make a play. I love bringing the physical aspect as well.”",,"Nelson, who was a No. 1 overall pick in the OHL draft, has offensive skill for days and is aggressive in getting up in the play. He struggles with the defensive elements of the game and at times makes the wrong decisions with the puck. The talent level is there for him to be an effective offensive player, but I have enough concern about his overall hockey sense.",,"Ty Nelson is a defenceman who subverts expectations.
Everything about his profile suggests that he's an offensive
blueliner in the making, whether it's his OHL draft pedigree
as a former first overall pick, his 5-foot-8 frame, or the 51
points he amassed in 66 games for the North Bay Battalion
in his draft year.
We used to view him in this light too, assigning Nelson the
No. 24 overall ranking on our first board back in November.
At least, we were open to the possibility, even if proof of
concept eluded us in many of our viewings.
As the unremarkable offensive performances accumulated,
we eventually had to move on from any previously held
notions concerning this player's profile, though.
""Still waiting to see Nelson's offensive skill,"" Elite Prospects
Dir. of North American Scouting Mitch Brown lamented in
a January report. ""He can hammer the puck, occasionally
set up a teammate on the inside, and activates somewhat
regularly. But he mostly chooses to do the first one. Sometimes,
he shows a more complex passing idea, but his pass
is so far from his target it makes me wonder if he actually
sees options.""
Many of those same issues rear their head in transition,
where Nelson regularly mishandles the puck or fails to
connect on the simplest of breakout plays. His skating skill
should make him one of the better puck-movers in the OHL,
but instead Brown's manually tracked data set places him in
the 61st percentile among CHL/USHL defenders last season.
The only part of Nelson's game that consistently drew
strong reviews from our staff was his play in the defensive
zone. No complaints there. The Battalion defender gaps up
early in the neutral zone, keeps pace with pacey attackers and
manages to make stops consistently. You'd never guess Nelson
was 5-foot-10 based on the way he contains along the walls
and comes away with possession from most puck battles.
If there's a future for Nelson at the NHL level, that's it -- as
an undersized defensive savant with perhaps some utility in
transition with a little careful development to that part of
his game. He has a long way to go before he's there, though.","Ty Nelson is a small, skilled blue-liner with high offensive skill.  Unlike Lane Hutson however, Nelson is physically strong, and his lack of size appears to be less of an issue with his game.  Nelson's calling card is his offensive game, and he plays a high-risk-high reward style of play.  He also isn't afraid to engage physically, and his strong balance allows him to out-muscle taller opponents.  

Some scouts have concerns surrounding Nelson's skating, especially his top speed.  That being said, he isn't necessarily a bad skater either.  Nelson's style of play fits his skating ability, making him less of a liability.  He can quarterback a powerplay as well and relishes the role.

Nelson projects as a second-pairing defender at the NHL level. He is likely 3-4 years away from competing for an NHL spot.","Ty Nelson is an offensive defender that loves to activate himself into the rush using his skating ability. He has strong skating ability, using his powerful lower body to generate powerful strides, allowing him to get up to full speed quickly. When he has the puck on his stick he's displayed high-end vision with the puck, finding teammates on the move and hitting them with crisp and accurate passes in stride. Defensively he's a bit of a mixed bag, but because of his skating ability and vision on the ice he shows a knack for being a successful rush defender. He uses his skating ability and body positioning to angle defenders into the boards and he gets his stick into the lanes to take away passes and knock the puck off opponents sticks. His game really starts to struggle when the opposing team gets the puck below the goal line and starts to operate out of the cycle. He seems a step behind the play when it comes to his processing speed and it really hurts him in the defensive zone as he has a tendency to wander out of position and overcommit to the puck, allowing his assignment to get open and generate a quality scoring chance. His defensive zone play did improve as the season progressed, which is a big positive for his future outlook and draft status and if he does continue to show steady improvement he can easily become the top-four defenseman he is projected to be by scouts. The NHL Draft is loaded with two-way defensemen, and given his skillset and the fact that he's a right-shot blueliner will certainly make Nelson appealing to scouts. He can be a solid five-on-five defender and play a significant role on the power play if he continues that development and reaches his full potential at the next level."
2021,D,78,214,1,BUF,1,Owen Power,"Power had a great freshman season as one of the best defensemen in his conference while also one of its youngest, and played a key role for Canada in its gold medal run at the world championships. Power's offensive toolkit won't jump out immediately to you, but a 6-foot-6 defenseman who can skate at the NHL level and move the puck well is a major asset. His skating isn't explosive, but his stride and edgework are excellent, and he can evade pressure very well. Power's offense comes from a great first pass and an ability to find seams in the offensive zone well. I question if he will be a go-to power play type, but I can for sure see him on PP2 and can be PP1 in a pinch. Defensively he's not that physical, but he closes on checks well with his range and reach, and breaks up a lot of plays. In a sentence, Power projects as a star all-situations NHL defenseman who won't land on highlight reels but will play tough minutes and drive play.","If you've followed this draft closely, you've probably read ad nauseam about there being no clear-cut No. 1 prospect. If you've followed my work closely this year, though, you'll also know that Owen Power has led the way from start to finish on my boards. He was No. 1 on my preliminary list. He was No. 1 on my midseason list. And he remains No. 1 here. Is he the top prospect in the same way that an Auston Matthews or a Connor McDavid were, where it was clear on draft day who was going to be the best player in their class (sorry Patrik Laine and Jack Eichel, but those debates were manufactured)? No, there are a handful of players who could make their case long-term. But I still feel pretty strongly about slotting him here and any internal debates I had with myself about other players were usually short-lived, especially after his stellar performance at the world championships where as his ice time grew, Canada's play improved.

Power's late birthday (Nov. 22, 2002) and towering frame prompt questions about the role both of those things may or may not have played in his dominance at a young age at lower levels (though more so in minor hockey and the USHL than college). And there are some other minor kinks he still needs to improve upon (funneling play to the outside with proper timing, smoothing out his pivots, and needing to be a little more aggressive in front of his own net). But there's nothing about his game that looks prohibitive, and he moves beautifully for a player who is now listed by NHL Central Scouting at 6-foot-6. He's mobile across the blue line through his footwork and his ability to open up his stride onto his inside edges. He's got superb cross-ice vision, which allows him to break down the offensive zone east-west as a seam passer. He's got uncanny skill for a player with his length and does a wonderful job adjusting around the first layer (though he could learn to attack past multiple waves of pressure a little more consistently because when he does he can get to the slot or the crease) or controlling the puck on exits and entries. And maybe most of all, he really understands how to operate on the ice, consistently reading play effectively, processing at high speeds when pace ratchets up, and picking his spots to attack or simplify. I wouldn't bet against him becoming an all-situations, big-minutes first-pairing defenceman and his floor probably positions him as a top-four blueliner.","Owen Power is a net front defenseman. He will put pressure on any attacker, who is looking to screen Strauss Mann and Erik Portillo (Michigan's goaltenders). When he is not sitting net front, he is closing down lanes primarily on the left side of the ice. Power is efficient at keeping the rush glued to the boards. By doing so, Power eliminates high danger situations and prevents the attack from doing much aside from cycling the puck around the half-wall. While Power thrives at shutting down lanes, he isn't overly physical. There are shifts where Power will lay down a hit, but it is not consistent. Most of the time, he insists on trapping the cycle along the boards, but will not look to neutralize the cycle on every single shift. He does exert more pressure when the rush gets to the perimeter. From the blue-line to the perimeter, he is more relaxed with his gap control.","By general consensus the cream of this year's draft crop, Power is both massive and can move extremely well. That combination in a player doesn't present itself too often. By no means the most graceful skater, the Mississauga, Ont. native still gets around at a high pace, thanks to his powerful strides. A solid two-way defenseman, Power can both contribute to the scoresheet and help keep his own net empty, as made evident by his recent appearance at the IIHF senior men's world championship. He controls and passes the puck well and has a dangerous shot.

Then there's the reach -- effective in stripping opponents -- that naturally accompanies his large frame. Heightened maturity and on-ice hockey IQ only enhances the defender's more obvious attributes. Power makes good choices on the fly, far more often than not. Once he learns to truly unleash all that his physical makeup has to offer, look out. The current Wolverine is a top-pair NHL defenseman in the making. Probably soon.","We might have Owen Power a bit lower if not for a pair of strong outings against Ohio State little over a week ago. On the other hand, a few more outings like those, and Power just might move into the conversation for No. 1 overall. Owen Power, it's a land of contrasts.

He's such a technically strong passer. That's going to be his meal ticket at the next level. It's already proven an efficient playmaking tool at this one. Scouts often compare Power stylistically to Victor Hedman. Squint a little, and you just might see it too, depending on the night. There just aren't many 6-foot-5 defenders out there who can skate like Power.","The NHL seems to have arrived at University of Michigan defenceman Owen Power as the consensus No. 1 overall talent in the 2021 NHL Entry Draft. We're not quite there, but Power is easily the best defenceman in the class, and the No. 3-ranked prospect on our board.
The way we tier these prospects is every bit as important as their speciﬁc place, and Power is ﬁrmly in that top-tier of players. There still was a faint call from within our group to keep Power near the top of our board, and we think he has the potential to be the draft's best player when we look back on this group 10 years later. It's just that we give him the third-best odds of getting there.
It's easy to understand the appeal with Power. There just aren't many 6-foot-6 defencemen who can skate quite like he does.
Power integrates linear and non-linear crossovers in space, moves with a good posture, and shows adequate ﬂexion in his ankles, knees, and hips. He's agile, elusive, and moves about as well as anyone could reasonably hope for from a player with his build.
That Power leveraged his skating, among other tools, into a top-four role with Michigan as an 18-year-old is some kind of impressive. According to our partners at InStat Hockey, he played nearly 23 minutes a night, and his team controlled 61 percent of the shot attempts at 5-on-5 in that time.
The data that Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting Mitchell  pried from Power's season paints a similarly dominant picture concerning how he generated those sterling two-way results. It's just not common for 18-year-old freshman defencemen to dominate between the blue lines like this. The low turnover numbers speak to Power's composure. He doesn't make many mistakes with the puck, and he has no problem working the short-range passing game to let his teammates do the legwork in transition.
Numbers always need context, though, and this is true of 's microdata set, too. Here's the thing: Power not turning the puck over, and executing controlled breakouts from the defensive zone should be a regular occurrence. That's not entirely to his credit though. He's deferential to a fault, settling almost exclusively for short-range passes, often at the slowest possible pace, almost always from a glide or a standstill.
Players with a transition proﬁle like Power's usually run into speedbumps as they make their way up the ranks to professional hockey. It's a hurdle for Power to clear, at the very least. He's much, much more effective as a primary puck-carrier or joining the rush as part of the second wave as his team attacks up ice. He doesn't hesitate. He has a great knack for ﬁnding space. And he has a big enough shot to credibly threaten from range.
Power's bad habits start to rear their ugly head again as his team has establishes sustained offensive zone pressure. He operates predominantly from a standstill or at a glide and does so with his hands and feet tied together in lockstep. He's more reactive as a result, and he doesn't create many opportunities with his feet.
Nonetheless, Power's vision is exceptional, and that gives us some conﬁdence that his in-zone playmaking will hold as he makes it to the NHL.
That said, don't expect him at the top of the defensive scoring leaderboard at any point in his career. Some secondary offence to the tune of 30-plus points at the height of Power's career seems reasonable enough. Anything else would just be found money.
Power may not have it in him to play top-pair minutes in the NHL, but he has all of the tools and craftsmanship to carve out a lengthy, productive career as a No. 3 or 4 defenceman, at the very least.","Power has been at the top of my list since the beginning of the year, and while there has been constant competition, Power remains in the #1 slot for the 2021 draft. At 6'5, Power is exactly that: a tower of power. A well-rounded two-way defender, Power played a key role for Michigan in the NCAA this year as a 17-year-old. Not only did he play exceptionally well, Power also starred for Canada in the World Championships, playing against grown men. He defied expectations, as he was previously expected to play limited minutes, but instead played a regular shift and didn't look out of place.

In terms of skill, Power's biggest asset is his combination of size, skill, and hockey sense. While Power is lacking a true “wow” factor, he can do a bit of everything. His defensive awareness is strong and he uses his reach to his advantage defensively. He has experience running a powerplay and doesn't look out of place. Power possesses an excellent first pass and does well in transition. He thinks the game at a high level and while he may never be a true NHL star, he will most certainly be a top-pairing defender for years to come. Power is likely headed back to Michigan next season and should be a full-time NHLer in 2022-2023.","Power reads the ice exceptionally and has mastered making plays on first touch and knowing when to activate from defense to offense. He's a transitional threat by jumping up with his passes if he doesn't have possession and is outstanding at putting pucks from danger areas into positive space for his teammates. He's crisp and efficient in finding the sticks of teammates through a variety of methods and through subtle deception tactics can lock the feet of opponents and go with a better option if available. In attack scenarios he displays patience to work toward advantageous matchups, letting play develop and seams to be presented instead of forcing an option. It's not uncommon to see him cover a full 200 feet in any given shift and he despite some execution blunders with mishandling pucks or double clutching, he has some finishing ability as well by choosing efficient shooting methods. He is one of the stronger gap defenders in the draft and can pare down opponents inside lanes, guiding opponents into poor areas and then angling hips to hands off a quick pivot and large closing stride. He's more effective at using his size as a deterrent showing good protection skills on retrievals and some deceptive footwork to create just enough hesitation to get out from under checks. His stick and instincts are huge pluses and he's not often caught flat footed or with his stick in the air unless he's taking a threatening stick out of the play.  When under pressure in the defensive zone, Power excels at making calculated decisions and is able to make quality passes to his outlets. He's not going to blow you away with blazing speed or have the quick shifter of a servo transmission but the technical aspects, stride extension and dynamic base allows him to pivot flawlessly, move laterally and cover mass amounts of room and do his job proactively whether it be on offense or defense. He will need to be more active in his net-front defense, as he can let the opponent get set easily and doesn't challenge them, tie them up, or box them up at times. His wrist shot appears to not have a lot of downward force in it, as it's more of a sweep, but his slap shot is hard and accurate."
2021,C,73,174,2,SEA,2,Matthew Beniers,"Beniers is the top center prospect in this draft. He has a quality NHL-caliber skill set but not a lot jumps off the page. He is a top prospect because he is an elite competitor and makes the most of his toolkit every game. I've seen him play nearly a hundred games over the last three years between the U.S. NTDP, college and international competitions, and I can count on one hand the times he's never made an impact on a game. His work ethic shows through how hard he forechecks and backchecks, how every play is made with speed, how he wins a ton of battles, and how fearless he is getting to the high-traffic areas. Beniers wills his way to puck possession and scoring chances, while also able to set up a lot of plays. In a sentence, Beniers projects as a top-two line center, a No. 2 on a Stanley Cup contender or a low-end No. 1, who can score at a reasonable rate for those roles and provide high-end value off the puck.","Beniers is probably going to be selected a pick or two higher than this and it'll be a good selection, so I wouldn't read into the actual number here too much. In a draft class full of players who don't necessarily play pro-style games, Beniers is built for the next level. He's a plus-level skater who gallops around the ice, plays on the inside (which opens up his effective cutbacks), pushes tempo in transition, and drives possession with his ability to win the game's 10-foot races. He can gain inside body positioning on engagements, and get up and under sticks in 50-50 board battles. He pushes through contact by keeping his feet moving, draws a lot of penalties, and keeps cycles alive. While he doesn't have the hands or feel that a Johnson has, nor the finishing touch of a Chaz Lucius or a Cole Sillinger, nor the heaviness of a Mason McTavish, he's got enough skill across the board to take pucks to the net, facilitate to his linemates off the cycle, and finish in tight. And though his offensive numbers may not pop at his ceiling, he's going to drive a line, lead exits and entries, get pucks to whoever he's playing with, and pull his team into the fight. Beniers is the best two-way player in the draft.","Matthew Beniers is a very intriguing prospect. In my views, I have failed to find a fault in his game. While a lot of scouts and analysts have claimed that Beniers doesn't have flash to his game, I would argue that he doesn't need flash. If you are capable of mastering the fundamentals, flash is not necessary. It's a nice to have. Plus, I would argue that mastering the fundamentals is flash.

Beniers is a smart hockey player. That statement is overused, but he does everything that you want him to do and knows exactly what to do to draw attackers to him and open up lanes for himself. Beniers always manages to get to the net and knows exactly what it takes to do so no matter what situation he is in.

Speaking of drawing attackers to him, Beniers does this with ease. If he is rushing up the right side of the ice and the attacker is to his left, he will opt to position the puck to his left. This draws the attacker in. When the attacker is approaching Beniers, he will shift the puck to his right and skate around the attacker. This allows him to bring the attacker to him and open up a clear path to the net. In the below clip, you can check out an example where Beniers was able to draw an attacker in to create an opportunity to open up a lane to allow him to complete a zone exit pass to his winger.","Beniers is the top-tier, two-way center about whom hockey squads dream. While his offensive numbers aren't as flashy as other top prospects, this pass-first playmaker makes his teammates better with his persistent quest for the puck and keen sense of anticipation. A relentless, high-paced, mobile skater and passionate competitor, his transition game is top-notch. Beniers never relents defensively, to the point of nearly serving as a third blueliner of sorts.

While most are in agreement the Massachusetts native is headed for a long NHL career as a second-line center, a top-unit role is hardly out of the question.","Matthew Beniers announced his status as a top prospect with a dominant two-way showing at the World Juniors as he helped the Americans capture gold in the bubble in Edmonton. It was a continuation of what many of us have seen from Beniers all season long at Michigan. His habits and details are already at a high-end level relative to the NHL, and his skating is a separating skill plain for all to see. The absence of a standout NHL level offensive tool limits his upside, but Beniers' floor is pretty exciting all its own.","Matty Beniers is the No. 1 prospect for the 2021 NHL Entry Draft. He's the complete package: A natural centre with an elite defensive proﬁle, unmatched transition value, and enough offence to comfortably project to the top-six of an NHL lineup. That Beniers revealed as much through such uniquely challenging circumstances this season only speaks to his quality.
Originally committed to Harvard, Beniers transferred to Michigan as it became increasingly clear that the Ivy League schools in the ECAC wouldn't participate in the 2020-21 season. He paused his freshman year to wear the stars and stripes at the World Juniors in Edmonton, and played excellent hockey, helping Team USA secure gold. If that wasn't enough, Beniers joined the Americans in Latvia for the World Hockey Championship and helped them take home bronze.
It's Beniers' skating that acts as the connective tissue binding every part of his game into one cohesive package.
He's a dynamic, high-pace transporter of the puck; one who accelerates with linear and non-linear crossovers through a wide array of rush patterns and tempo changes to manoeuvre past opposing defenders.
It's evident in Beniers' tape, but the neutral zone data that Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting Mitchell  collected from his time at Michigan and with the United States at the World Juniors really sends the message home. “Another awesome transition performance from Beniers, driving play up the middle with comical ease,”  said of Beniers in a March 5th game report. “Always cuts away from pressure, entering retrievals with pre-scanning and deception to prepare the space. Problem-solves pressure when necessary, independent hands and feet keep his posture deceptive. Instinctively drives play up the middle; a high-end transition manipulator.”
He's the most efﬁcient puck-carrier in this class, and he can get even better with more speed as a skater through improved ankle ﬂexion, a more restrained upper body, and better posture. There's no telling whether Beniers will iron out those inefﬁciencies, but if he does, watch out.
Of course, one can't broach Beniers' game without a thorough review of his work in the defensive third.
He never cheats. Beniers is always involved in his team's defensive game, showing high-level details, defensive problem-solving ability, and switchability. He takes great lines on puck-retrievals, and consistently displays excellent supporting instincts. He's physical, always taking the extra stride rather than lunging with his stick, cutting off opponents at their hands.
There is little doubt among our group that Beniers is the premier defensive pivot in this year's draft.
The only real question for us was whether Beniers brought enough to the table offensively to meet the expectations of a No. 1 overall pick. We're not certain we can answer that question in the afﬁrmative, but there are some reasons for cautious optimism to that end.
The way Beniers carries the puck through the neutral zone and attacks on an arc is going to create numbers advantages at the NHL level. That's going to lead to a tonne of rush offence. That Benier has ﬂashed the occasional bit of deception on his passes and shown some strong off-the-puck timing and instincts offers hope, too.
It's also easy enough to imagine a scenario where Beniers puts up numbers with his speed by just speeding right past defenders. They say that speed kills, and Beniers is like a roadrunner out there.
Even so, Beniers lack of overwhelming skill as a puckhandler, good-not-great touch as a distributor, and a shot that registers as about NHL average could prove prohibitive to gaudy point totals.
Realistically, Beniers proﬁles as a top-six matchup centre with a dominant two-way proﬁle and enough scoring touch to hang in that part of an NHL lineup. He's never going to climb the NHL points leaderboard, but something in the 45-55-point range seems attainable at the height of his career.","Beniers is one of the few players in this draft that played a ton this season. He averaged a point-per-game for Michigan in the NCAA. He also played from the U.S. at the World Junior Championships and the World Championship. Beniers excelled in all tournaments, showing what makes him a top-five prospect.

This past season, Beniers showed why he is likely the most well-rounded player in this draft. At the World Juniors, Beniers was relied on in all situations, including key defensive face-offs and shut-down matchups. An excellent skater with elite work ethic and drive, Beniers anticipates the play exceptionally well in all zones. He is fearless in puck battles and isn't afraid to go into high-traffic scoring areas, though he isn't a power-forward type. His awareness and style of play is more similar to Ryan O'Reilly or Jonathan Toews. More of a playmaker than a goal-scorer, Beniers uses all players on the ice well to maintain puck possession 

What is preventing Beniers from being number one on this list is ultimately a lack of dynamic play and ability. Teams will be okay with this though considering Benier's overall play and game. He will likely return to Michigan for one more year and projects as a top-six forward at the NHL level. ","One of the more energizing top prospects around, Beniers approach to the game is relentless. His game is built around pressure by taking his style of game to the opponent and keeping them on their heels. His mix of elite competitiveness and high-end smarts makes him tough to contain on offence and a disruptive nuisance on defense. His feet never stop moving and has a great stance and stride that makes him fairly efficient with his movements. He keeps low, has really solid hip flexion, while not leaning too much. He keeps a wider stance throughout his straightaway stride that helps him generate good power but also recovers quickly for his next push off. In addition, his use of crossovers to generate speed through transition, winding his way through traffic, finding lanes and attacking the blue line with solid speed are key aspects of his movement. He is powerful on the puck and is effective at protecting his hands from opponents, at times showing a giddy mindset to lead with his hands but able to cut linear or side step pressure. The technical elements to his shooting prowess, and how he applies deceptive elements to his passes by looking off defenders, are really effective and he shows the qualities of what could be a high-level multitasker. He never seems to be out of position or thinking a step behind the play in any zone or in any situation. His offensive vision is well above average, as he can open up rush space in conjunction with his teammates and make nice passes in full flight. He's an effective problem solver under pressure but his mindset is one-tracked at times to just force his style of play onto opponents that he doesn't see the whole picture. Beniers style of game in these scenarios result in him trying to attack alone in scenarios and not showing presence of mind to adapt a consistent secondary game with off-puck offensive tactics. This type of skill expression and mindset has a low-percentage success rate and will be more detrimental as he advances with a limited scope. There's not a ton of creativity to his game and his shot isn't especially notable, but he should be able to score a good numbers of points at the NHL level because of his skating, work ethic and ability to learn systems. On top of a stellar freshman season in the NCAA with the University of Michigan, Beniers was the lone draft-eligible on Team USA at the World Junior Championship and in the men's World Championships."
2021,LW,70,176,7,SJS,3,William Eklund,"Eklund was an important player on an SHL team as an 18-year-old — a rare feat for a first-year draft-eligible player — and played well for Sweden's national team. He has good, not great, straightaway speed to go along with fantastic edgework. He shows tremendous elusiveness to evade pressure and create space with his skating. Eklund skates fast, but it's his skating plus his compete that earned the trust of big minutes as he showed he could be responsible off the puck. He combines that with a high skill level, a very imaginative hockey IQ offensively and the ability to execute difficult plays at speed. His ability to play in the high-traffic areas and win battles, but also play on the perimeter and be a primary set-up guy, will make him a versatile NHL player. In a sentence, Eklund projects as an undersized first-line NHL winger with dynamic attributes.","Eklund faced his fair share of obstacles in his draft year, including a bout with COVID-19 and an appendectomy. But he emerged with an outstanding age-adjusted season in arguably the world's third-best pro league (the SHL), with 25 points in 43 combined regular season and playoff games. That 0.58 points-per-game rate bested both Lucas Raymond (0.53) and teammate/frequent linemate Alexander Holtz (0.51), who are seven and nine months older respectively.

Eklund is a well-rounded three-zone player who can do a little bit of everything offensively (he's strong and agile below the goal line, he's a capable transporter, and he's an above-average finisher, handler and passer) and defensively (he supports the play well, takes smart routes to pucks and pinches along the wall, and engages effectively in battles to win more than you might expect when you glance at his height). Eklund's biggest strength, though, is the way he navigates on the ice. He slides in and out of space to get open for his shot (a shot which has improved to make him a real mid-range threat) and play the give-and-go game effectively. He makes a lot of small-area plays around the net to attack the slot or play a puck into it, with proper timing, for a teammate. He's just a crafty problem-solver who knows his game and how to play within himself to make something happen from shift-to-shift.","Skating is more important than ever in today's NHL. One of the areas that has been criticized about Eklund by many is his ability in that area, especially given his size. It must be said that he is not the fastest skater. However, he is very strong down low, and has good edges and agility. Despite not having blazing speed you will almost never see him caught up ice, or beaten to a puck though. Why? Because he has five feet of ice on virtually everyone else between his ears.

Eklund is the highest IQ player in this draft. He already understands coverages better than most NHL top six forwards. The Stockholm native seems to know what defensemen are going to do before they themselves make a decision. As a result he manages to get completely free around the slot, near the crease, behind the net, and in the circles more often than seems plausible. With the puck on his stick he puts his brain-power to use as well. He turns players inside out regularly on the cycle, not through outrageous moves, but by cutting back on himself at the very moments his marker least expects him to, leaving them out of position and with Eklund free to walk in towards goal.
His vision is also high-end. It is not rare to see him make a pass without so much as looking at his line-mate, and it land flush on tape for a prime scoring chance. Combine this with a beautiful passing touch and he can freeze defenses before they compute what is happening to give line-mates high-end opportunities with regularity.
When it comes to his shot the young Swede relies on an extremely quick release on both his snap-shot and wrister. He does not have the heaviest or most accurate shot, but with the positions he manages to get to almost every shift it is rare that when the puck comes to him he is not in a dangerous shot location. The result this season has been that he leads his team in goals. Now, his 18.9% shooting will almost certainly come down as the year goes on, but this high percentage is also driven by his shot locations.

However, there is certainly room for improvement in his shot selection and execution.","There's a lot of buzz about this prospect, and for good reason. In his first full SHL season, Eklund proved he could more than keep up. Forty games, 11 goals and 12 assists later, we're left with little doubt the 18-year-old is already able to compete with professional men.

A quick, shifty skater with outstanding edges, Eklund presents as your classic 200-foot player. An intuitive and creative playmaker, he has great hands, an accurate shot, and battles equally hard in his own zone. He's also super smart, rarely gets rattled, and works his tail off -- a coach's dream. With a look to Eklund's future in the NHL, his diminutive size remains the only perceived weakness. And he's still growing and filling out.","There wasn't much of a debate at No. 1. Everyone in our ranks fortunate enough to set their eyes on William Eklund agrees that, for now anyway, he's the best prospect in the draft. He's a high-pace, deceptive dual-threat scorer with advanced puck-protection mechanics and strong habits in all three zones. A lack of ankle flexion limits Eklund's straight-line explosiveness, but hardly to a prohibitive degree. Really, he's the complete package.","It seemed as if Djurgårdens winger William Eklund was destined for the top spot on our ﬁnal ranking as recently as February. Instead, he's the runner-up as the second-best prospect for the 2021 NHL Draft.
That he's fallen ever so slightly to No. 2 in time for our ﬁnal ranking is hardly an indictment of Eklund though. There was a strong thrust from within our group to keep him at the top of our board, it's just that the calls for Matthew Beniers in that spot were that much louder.
It's all about the details with Eklund. He's never going to overwhelm you with his physical tools, but the collection of these above-average elements to his game are made better than the sum of their parts by his mature, detail-oriented approach.
Our Dir. of North American Scouting Mitchell  broke this down masterfully in a mid-season proﬁle on the Djurgårdens winger in a bit of crossover work. Speciﬁcally, he looked at how Eklund layers deception to create advantages that might not otherwise exist with the tools at his disposal.
“Many players deceive the opposition with one move inside a single possession, but few layer on more deceptive elements and link them together than Eklund,”  wrote. “It's common for Eklund to intentionally move the defender's feet in one direction before going back across. As the next defender arrives, he slows down and turns his body towards the point, encouraging the defender to reach before blowing past them. Simple, but effective.”
How effective? Eklund spent the entire year with Djurgårdens' men's roster and led all U19 skaters in the SHL with 23 points in 40 games, good for the points per game lead, too.
There's an element of fearlessness to Eklund's game that, again, acts as a bit of a force multiplier on the tools at his disposal. He's willing to get between the dotted lines as a puck-carrier or drive the net for a chance -- that's where goal-scorers go to make things happen. And while Eklund isn't likely to win many footraces at the NHL level, his skating habits have thus far made him difﬁcult to pin down for opposing defenders. This is especially true in the small area game, where Eklund's use of cutbacks, direction changes, and well-timed weight transfers have proven highly effective tools for creating space. That Eklund moves the puck with pace doesn't hurt either.
Even so, it would be nice to see Eklund clean up his stride a bit; he's a little top-heavy and suffers a lack of ankle ﬂexion. Frankly, there just isn't much pop to his stride.
Likewise, Eklund would do well to not over-commit so frequently in the defensive zone. His work rate is unimpeachable, but it's a curse as much as it is a blessing. Eklund has a nasty habit of chasing plays in his own end, often creating lapses within his team's defensive zone structure as a result. That sort of thing tends to get exploited at the NHL level.
Ultimately, whichever team drafts Eklund isn't going to bring him into their organization to tilt the ice or to shut down the opposition's best. They're calling on Eklund because they believe in his well-rounded, detailed approach to creating offence, one that should scale up to the NHL level without much fuss.
He's a gifted playmaker, with enough off-the-puck smarts to occasionally posture as a shooting threat even without a high-end shot. And by Jeremy Davis' pGPS (Prospect Graduation Probabilities System) model, the prospect with the best statistical proﬁle in this year's crop.
Davis' model grants Eklund a 95 percent chance of making the NHL and a 65 percent chance of being a top-six forward or better. Those are ﬁrst-overall calibre numbers.
It's not hard to imagine a scenario where Eklund reliably generates offence at a low-end ﬁrst-line clip through the height of his career with a neutral or better two-way proﬁle. That's more than worth the investment at this point in this draft.","Even in the midst of injury, Eklund was able to play more than most prospects this season. Unfortunately, he missed both the World Junior Championship and the World Championship. However, Eklund did play against men in Sweden's top league and excelled throughout the season.

Eklund's calling card is his offensive tool kit. He excels in one-on-one situations, using his edges puck skills to create space for himself.  Eklund can also run a powerplay and excels at playmaking from the perimeter. Another positive to his game is his compete level.  Though small in stature, Eklund doesn't give up on plays. This makes him a versatile offensive player who can play in a top or bottom six.  

The biggest question scouts have is Eklund's size. However, it hasn't slowed him down as a teenager playing against men in Sweden, and it's unlikely to do so at the NHL level either.

Some scouts believe Eklund is the most NHL-ready of prospects this year. I believe he will head back to Sweden and play one more year before making the NHL jump. He projects as a top-six, offensive-minded forward at the NHL level.","Eklund's hockey sense is probably his single best asset. He never seems to be lost in the play or overwhelmed by it, so he's rarely a liability. He is very good without the puck, knowing how to pressure opponents into making turnovers and correctly anticipating where the puck is going. Eklund has plenty of acceleration, top speed and agility to work with, allowing him to beat opponents in direct footraces or take more creative routes. Using his strong edges and some subtle misdirection, he has the ability to create scoring chances with his skating alone. All over the ice, Eklund's head is on a swivel. He's constantly checking for where his man is and where everyone else is. Then, when he gets possession, he already knows where he's headed. This especially helps in the offensive zone, as he can find his teammates through thick traffic, setting up an excellent chance in this game, passing through four players. It allows him to pull off some deceptive drop and behind the back passes, making him a very intriguing playmaker. His puck control is quite advanced and he can carry it and make plays at full speed. He's very slippery in the cycle, twisting his body to protect the puck and using his head, hands and feet to be deceptive. He reads and reacts to the play quickly enough to make dangerous passes and can make plays off his backhand. He does well to get himself into dangerous shooting areas without the puck, using both his quickness and his smarts. He attacks with speed, drives the puck to the net, and can change his shooting angle on shot attempts. His release is quick and surprisingly powerful, plus he doesn't need a lot of room to get the puck on net. He also shows good offensive habits by remaining around the net for second opportunities, and works to find open space. Without the puck, he is relentless on the forecheck, has a great work ethic, and solid defensive positioning. Eklund competes hard and doesn't quit on plays, including making desperation moves, such as diving poke checks, if it's his last resort. He's fearless in his play. In puck battles, Eklund is competitive and has a strong stick. Breaking the puck out of the defensive zone, he is aware of his options and is responsible with the puck. One area of improvement for Eklund would be his pass receiving skills. At times wide passes can bounce or bobble off of his stick, especially firm passes to his backhand. Spending his entire draft year in the SHL should prepare him well for the next level."
2021,D,73,181,8,LAK,4,Brandt Clarke,"Clarke went to Slovakia because there was no OHL season and was quite good. He is a dynamic player with the puck because of his puck skills and playmaking ability. He has the poise and vision to make tough plays from both ends of the rink. He can beat opponents with his skill consistently and looks unique with the puck on his stick, with true first power-play unit potential in the NHL. The concern on Clarke is his skating as he's a somewhat knock-kneed skater without great quickness. He defends well in junior due to his sense and having decent reach, but the pace will be a concern in that regard as he advances levels. In a sentence, Clarke projects as a second or third defenseman who can be on a top NHL power-play unit but may not be able to face top opponents defensively.","I often refer to Clarke as a bit of a unicorn in this draft in that he doesn't look or play anything like most defencemen these days. He's gangly, he doesn't really look like an athlete, and there's some knee-knocking in his forward and backward skating stride. All of these issues can make a scout a little queasy. But he has worked diligently to build more power into his lower body (progress which will need to continue) and the actual talent just oozes out of him. Clarke plays a free-flowing, fearless, aggressive roving style that keeps opposing players guessing. He looks, at all times, completely unbothered by the stage or the pressure of opposing players. That looseness blends with impressive side-to-side puckhandling skill and mobility which allow him to effortlessly step past coverage in all three zones. He also walks the line as effortlessly as anyone in the draft, constantly maneuvering and changing looks. And while he's not afraid to try things and that can scare a coach, his ability to execute on the spin-pass or flip-pass that he sees that few others do (or at least that few others are willing to try) is remarkable. It can be difficult to project a player like Clarke, who doesn't play a pro-style game and isn't necessarily going to mesh with every coach he encounters, but I love the assertiveness and the skill. When he's out there, you can't take your eyes off of him. He's also an above-average defender who does a good job disrupting play and transitioning back the other way — and who should only improve in his own end as he continues to get stronger.","With Brandt Clarke, you can expect a defender that plays the rush extremely well, blocks lanes and pushes the attack to the corners. Clarke gets in your face, gives you as little room as possible and looks for the best moment to pounce on the puck. But, what I really like about Clarke is that you can't read him like an open book. With every situation, there is a different strategy with Clarke. You can not predict when Clarke will pounce and there is no way of telling how Clarke will try to strip the puck away from you. I have seen instances where Clarke becomes Sergio Ramos or Dani Alves and slide tackles for the puck. Before I go on, I just want to clarify that those instances were not slew foots. Clarke was playing the puck and there was no evidence that he was going to for the skates or legs.
While Clarke has shown that he possesses a strong defensive game, I've noticed that Clarke's skating needs further improvement in order to become NHL ready. For instance, he will have difficulty keeping his balance when deploying outside edges. When defending a puck carrier who is looking to find a gap and can be rather shifty, Clarke will have to deploy outside edges to keep pace, but don't be surprised if he puts his hand directly on the ice surface to try to keep his balance.
Given how strong he is at puck movement, he will often find himself forced to handle heavy pressure when isolated in the neutral zone. Given his adaptability, he reacts quickly and can weave around traffic with the puck on his stick with ease. He stick-handles around traffic and he is a sneaky stick-handler. Clarke is not a flashy stick-handler, but he embodies soft hands that allows him to swerve the puck around an attacker quickly.
In the offensive zone, Clarke does not just stick to playing the point. Instead, he prefers to be all over the offensive zone. Clarke will pinch and shuffle between the low slot, perimeter and blue-line. On the power play, his puck distribution as a power play quarterback is on point. The delivery is quick and accurate. From a shooting perspective, Clarke does not just fire low danger shots as mentioned in the chart. He gets involved in high danger, medium danger and low danger situations. In fact, Clarke had 16 high danger shots in his 2019-2020 season. Lambos, Hughes, Power and Edvinsson did not come close to that at all. Lambos had the second highest high danger shots with six. Not only does Clarke get involved all over the offensive zone, but he will use his stick-handling to get him in position to succeed.","A brilliant offensive defenseman, Clarke often serves as a bonus forward on the ice. A skilled puck-mover with a right-handed shot, he's built to run a power play -- which he's already done at the pro level in Slovakia, where he was loaned this past season. Patient and perpetually calm, Clarke anticipates play well and adapts quickly.

His skating remains a work-in-progress -- particularly backwards -- and his defensive play could use some refining, but this offense-minded blueliner is likely bound to fill a top-pairing NHL role in the not-too-far future.","The uncertainty of the OHL's future forced Brandt Clarke's hand. He's plying his trade with HC Nove Zamky in the Slovak Extraliga on loan, playing over 20 minutes a night in all-situations against men, and looking the part of a top prospect in the process. Clarke is an offensive defenceman; one who layers deception at the blue line to open up passing lanes and strikes with ruthless efficiency. His skating concerns our group. He's working with a wide stride, landing hard on those inside edges. So too does his neutral zone defending. Overall, though, there's top-four potential here.","Brandt Clarke is the best offensive defenceman in the 2021 NHL Entry Draft. He travelled great
With the OHL season in peril, Clarke took a trip to the Slovak Extraliga to link up with his brother Graeme and play for HC Nove Zamky, where he collected 15 points in 25 games. Clarke then ﬂew from Slovakia to Texas for the U18s, where he downright dominant, picking up seven points in seven games with a 66 percent shot attempt share at evens. Sufﬁce to say, Clarke dominated every competitive hockey setting that was offered to him this season. One of them was a top men's league in Slovakia, and the other was the hyper-competitive, high-stakes U18s. We couldn't help but wonder if Clarke's numbers in Slovakia aren't just the slightest bit artiﬁcially low, too. It took him about 10 games to hit his stride, and he left Nove Zamky on a high note with seven points in his ﬁnal four games.
Those numbers speak to the unrelenting aggression that punctuates Clarke's every manoeuvre. He wants to make something happen every time the puck is on his stick, and he's not afraid to push the play himself to see it through.
Clarke surveys the ice going into every puck retrieval, and then immediately turns his team's posture from that of the defender to the aggressor with his ﬁrst touch. He'll shoulder-shimmy forecheckers out of position, anticipate opposing defender's routes, and pierce through their formation with ease.
Our OHL scout, Rachel Doerrie, summed this up well with a U18 game report. “Clarke's brain and ability to process the movement of others on the ice to make his own reads is elite. He sees things that others do not, is patient with the puck, and allows the play to develop before he makes his decision.”
Clarke's enthusiasm sometimes gets him in trouble or keeps him from ﬁnding teammates in space and hitting them with a well-placed pass to carry the puck themselves. Fortune favours the bold, and Clarke lives that maxim with his every defensive zone puck touch. But as Duke Charles the Bold's downfall at the Battle of Nancy made clear, sometimes caution is warranted. Swiss reinforcements aren't bearing down on Clarke with their halberds in tow, but a turnover at the wrong moment just might be hockey's equivalent of meeting that end.
There is, of course, a disconnect between Clarke's skating stride and his hyper-aggressive style, though. Simply put: Whichever team drafts Clarke is going to need to drastically alter the composition of his skating stride for him to effectively play this swashbuckling style of hockey in the NHL. He's a centred, wide skater, with his knees caved in, almost always operating from his inside edges. It's just a plain old ugly stride mechanically.
Clarke's deception has allowed him to manoeuvre between forecheckers unabated to this point in his career, but that's going to be increasingly difﬁcult as the talent pool compresses.
We don't have any concerns about Clarke's skill set in the offensive zone though. There's no shortage of projectable components from Clarke's game in the ﬁnal third, whether it's the 
look-offs, shot fakes, give-and-gos, deceptive passing, high activity rate, or the knack to draw numbers so that he might create space elsewhere for his teammates.
Even if we're a little worried about Clarke's skating and his ability to defend in space, there is no denying his NHL-level pace, offensive sense, and creativity with the puck. Everything is in place for Clarke to play top-four minutes in the NHL at the height of his career. If he can work out some of the kinks in his skating, something more substantial isn't out of the question.","Evaluating Clarke has been difficult at times this season.  With the OHL season canceled, Clarke played games in Slovakia with some success. However, he did star with Canada at the World Junior Championship. Clarke put up a point-per-game and played in all situations.

Clarke may be the best offensive-minded defender in this draft. He has elite hockey sense and playmaking ability. Clarke is creative and loves driving play. There is a dynamic element to his game that is lacking from many other top-end prospects in this year's draft. If the OHL had played this season, he very well may have challenged Power for the number one position on this list. Clarke possesses an overall unique skillset and is constantly aware of where his teammates are on the ice, making dynamic passes and creating opportunities for maintained possession with ease.

Clarke's biggest area of improvement is his skating, a somewhat surprising realization given his overall skillset. However, there is some concern that his wonky stride will prevent him from being dynamic at the NHL. He didn't look out of place playing against men in Slovakia though, and there is a high likelihood of improvement in this area of his game. Clarke will most certainly be returned to the OHL next season and is likely two to three years away from NHL duty.","An offensive-minded defenseman in every aspect of the game, Clarke is incredibly confident and competitive, constantly trying to make himself a pass option or drive the play himself. He has a highly-creative offensive mind and isn't afraid to try flashy plays, and he should be able to keep catching opponents off guard from time to time. Clarke regularly tries to direct play by calling for pucks or sending stick signals. He wins his fair share of board battles, thanks to his determination, hand-eye coordination and understanding of gaining body positioning. He has quick and soft hands and displays great ability to maneuver the puck in tight spaces. He can handle the puck very well, making quick moves when in puck possession, enabling him to escape from situations where the opponents set pressure on him.  Clarke is always aware of his linemates when in puck possession and distributes pucks accurately, sometimes being able to thread the needle, showing great vision. He sometimes tends to make risky plays that can go the wrong way if failed. Decision-making in his own end is good but not great, as his vision can be narrow. He will occasionally miss one or more options that are better than whatever he picked. He could be quicker reading and reacting. He is very confident with the puck on his stick, skating it through the neutral zone in transition with purpose and showing good management of his speed and balance to find open patches of ice to make zone entries. He skates very well laterally, either moving forward or backward, and his pivots are clean. His skating mechanics aren't perfect, he can look a little wobbly at times with his knock-kneed stride, but his explosiveness opens up tons of space. He has solid awareness when defending in his own zone, but is still learning to pick and choose when to pressure his man with body contact or simply use his long reach. Clarke's acceleration and overall strength in puck battles is still a long way from the top levels, but he has the brain and puck skills to eventually contribute as an all-situations defender in the NHL. With the OHL season cancelled, Clarke spent his season overseas in Slovakia. While it took him some time to adjust to the league, his overall play was strong against men."
2021,D,74,182,4,NJD,5,Luke Hughes,"Hughes had a strong season, as a leading player for the U.S. NTDP, but a late-season injury kept him from playing at the U18 worlds. Hughes is a 6-foot-2 elite-skating defenseman with offensive ability, which is a highly appealing toolkit for an NHL projection. Like his brothers Jack and Quinn, Luke's edgework is fantastic, showing great ability to elude checks. His skating and skill combination allow him to generate a lot of controlled exits and entries. His playmaking isn't at the same level as his brothers, but he has enough skill and vision to be on an NHL power play and be a driver at the top level. The size and skating combination should allow him to make stops as a pro, but currently his D-zone coverage isn't completely refined, as he needs to work on his gaps. He can be a bit risky and turnover prone with the puck, and managing that is a main area of concern with scouts. In a sentence, Hughes projects as a top-pair defenseman who can be on a power play and be elite in transition, but will have issues matching up versus top players.","Ask five different people from Hughes' trajectory to this point about him and you'll get five different trains of thought. I've spoken with people who played or coached against him in the GTHL who are shocked by how far he's come and confess that he wasn't one of the talked-about top prospects of the time. And I've spoken to others more recently within the U.S. NTDP, the University of Michigan, and among some NHL clubs who salivate over what he's become and what still might be ahead. He's one of the youngest players in the 2021 draft class, he underwent a growth spurt last summer which changed the way he could play into his draft year, and then he lacerated a tendon in his foot in March which ended his season and kept him from showcasing himself at U18 worlds. Hughes is a brilliant skater and arguably the draft's best transition defender as a result. His ability to take the puck from A to B in straight lines is also matched by deft edgework which allows him to circle the offensive zone to draw eyeballs once he gets there. He has a lot of room to grow (he still needs to fill out his frame and get stronger, which will help him use his length a little more effectively without the puck and his shot as well) and there have been times when he has left me wanting more, but he has time to round out his game and build upon a thrilling package.","Hughes is most known for his skating. Almost every game that I tune in to, the first comment that I hear from the play by play and color guys is how dominant Hughes' stride is. The young defenseman has a silky smooth stride and possesses elite edges. I know that “silky smooth” can be overused quite a bit in scouting reports, but Hughes does have a silky smooth stride. Every glide is well-timed. The extension is not too long and the recovery is exactly where you want it. Not too far out from the torso. With Hughes' edge work, it allows him to be more spontaneous and quick with the puck than most. We see that quite a bit with his transitional play and defensive zone puck possession. Instead of forcing the puck into tight spots and well-defended lanes, Hughes will opt to re-group and drop back. Sometimes the final decision is to try that same lane once more as the defenders have backed off and abandoned the pressure and/or sometimes it provides Hughes with the ability to pivot, shift gears and find a different lane/avenue to utilize. In order to be that decisive with the puck, you need strong edges to shift or turn away from danger. It also is an indicator of how robust his transitional play is. Players don't get rewarded for transitional fails. They get rewarded for successful transitions. With the ability to drop back and re-define the plan of attack, the probability of a successful transition is much higher than trying to push through danger.
Aside from Hughes' skating, my second favorite attribute about the left-handed defenseman is his soft hands. Soft hands are always a great thing to have when you are distributing the puck, shifting around an attacker with the puck or trying to deliver a cross ice feed. While there are certainly moments where Hughes is more jumpy and a bit rough with his feeds, most of the time Hughes is delivering smooth feeds to teammates. In addition, his handy work also pays off when he takes the outside lane and shifts around an attacker while he is rushing up the ice. Hughes loves showing the leather when he is racing towards the slot, but has a man on him. He will shift the puck from left to right, evade the attacker and set up a pass to the slot. But, don't forget how elite his passing ability is. Hughes can truly thread the needle with his smooth feeds.","According to many members of the NHL scouting community, the youngest Hughes brother is the best skating defenseman in this draft class. That extraordinary speed and mobility helps at both ends of the ice, either in staving off opposing skaters or serving as a puck-moving commodity on the rush. A high hockey IQ, good vision, and above-average passing ability round out an appealingly complete, if still raw, blue-line package.

Already bigger than both of his older brothers Jack and Quinn, Luke -- who doesn't turn 18 until September -- is due to bulk up a bit more. Fortunately, the foot laceration suffered in late winter of this past season isn't expected to be an enduring issue. Eventually, this high-ranking defensive prospect should settle into the NHL as a valuable top-four asset.","Luke Hughes, a little like Power before him, benefitted from a turn for the better in some of our more recent viewings. We always liked his skill, and our American scout, , even went so far as to rate Hughes as a superior skater to Jake Sanderson from just one class prior. It's just that the decision-making and a penchant to skate into pressure left us troubled. More of what we've seen lately from Hughes and our projection will only get rosier.","First, there was Quinn, and then Jack followed just one season later. Now it's Luke Hughes' turn to walk the (virtual) draft stage as the family's latest offering to the NHL.
True to the Hughes brand, Luke is a dynamic, puck-rushing, highly inventive defender. He has a ﬂair for the dramatics, and never shies away from the opportunity to lead the puck up-ice, even in the face of daunting odds.
So, naturally, the basis of Hughes' game is his skating. He's one of our highest-graded skaters for the 2021 NHL Entry Draft for a reason. There just aren't many holes to poke in his mechanical skating form.
Hughes starts with the perfect skating posture, settling comfortably into his stride as he darts around the ice. There's great ﬂexibility in his hips, knees, and ankles, and he never has any trouble achieving the appropriate depth through his stride.
There is, of course, one inefﬁciency in Hughes' skating that really stands out. He's got a nasty heel kick on his forward stride, but we're not overly concerned. There's a good chance he'll iron that out as he adds lower-body strength. Besides, it hasn't kept him from earning a 6.5-grade or better from every one of the Elite Prospects' scouts.
His skating habits are pretty stellar, too. Hughes collects the puck in-stride, skates through his passes, and weaponizes movement to draw opposing defenders to his orbit, creating space for his teammates. He's always looking to create advantages with the puck on his stick.
“[Hughes'] stride is extraordinarily smooth, and it features quality ankle ﬂexion, full-extension, a clean recovery under the body,” Elite Prospects Dir. of Film Scouting  wrote in a mid-season proﬁle on EP Rinkside. “Also notice the use of crossovers as he weaves his way through the neutral zone, and pushes the defender back.”
“That stride length and ability to employ some crossovers while accelerating through the neutral zone is key to added deception on rushes, setting up dekes and keeping defenders on the back peddle in an uncomfortable position.” Hughes has leveraged his grace as a skater to create breakouts and zone entries with relative ease to this point in his career. The data Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting Mitchell  collected from Hughes' time with the USNTDP captures this perfectly. What this chart doesn't quite capture is Hughes' excesses as a puck-carrier and how they sometimes come back to haunt him. It seems at times as if Hughes just kind of wings it. He doesn't scan for incoming threats, skates away from supporting teammates, and often just dead-ends the puck right into the opposition's hands.
Those turnovers are only going to prove more costly as Hughes rises up the ranks. That part of Hughes' development is going to be critical to getting the most out of him at the NHL level.
We've seen some nice ﬂashes of high-end, projectable skill from Hughes. He joins the second wave of the rush whenever there's an opportunity, enthusiastically activates off of the blue line, and works magic with the puck on his stick in the small area game. He distributes well enough too, even if he's not exceptionally deceptive or manipulative as a playmaker.
Some of the advantages that Hughes' pure skill as a handler and grace as a skater confer aren't going to be nearly as profound as the talent pool compresses though. His shot isn't going to pick up the slack either; it's comfortably below NHL average.
We're far more concerned with what happens in the defensive zone when Hughes is on the ice than what happens when his team is on the attack.
He struggles to problem-solve complex defensive situations, particularly in space. He doesn't scan nearly often enough. He sometimes takes inefﬁcient lines to the puck. He has a nasty habit of biting on the ﬁrst move, too.
We saw some real growth from Hughes over the course of the season as a neutral zone defender. His gap control improved, and he was closing with much better timing. It turned from a bit of a weakness to a real strength by the end of the season. When you account for Hughes' pros and cons, you're looking at a player with all of the tools necessary to develop into a competent puck-moving, offensively calibrated top-four defender at the NHL level. Hughes is committed to the University of Michigan for the 2021-22 season.","I've been high on Hughes all season long, and an injury keeping him out of the Under-18's hasn't changed my mind whatsoever. The brother of former first-overall pick Jack Hughes of the New Jersey Devils and Vancouver Canucks' star Quinn, Luke has a bit of a different skill set than his older brothers.

Luke, however, is significantly taller and plays a more-well rounded defensive game than his siblings at the same age. Hughes is an elite skater and loves to use his edges. Playing for the U.S. National Development Program, Hughes played in all situations and accelerated quarterbacking the power play. He excels at moving the puck up quickly and uses his size well, especially for a player that skates so well. Like his brother Quinn, there is a high probability that Luke will be able to drive play at the NHL level. At the very least, he will be able to quarterback a powerplay and help with a team's possession game significantly.

Some scouts have questioned Hughes' defensive ability at times, but this will likely come with increased maturity. Hughes will likely have an opportunity to play alongside Owen Power next season, which will be massive for his overall development.

He had a major injury at the end of the season, but Hughes should be ready for the fall where he will attend powerhouse Michigan in the NCAA. He projects as a first-pairing defender at the NHL level and is likely two years away from NHL duty.","Hughes is a high-end, puck-moving defenseman and brilliant when it comes to his offensive zone play in how he can create space by drawing defenders to open ice instead of making the first, impulsive play when pressure is presented. His edge work is high end and he boasts a long powerful stride when he gets to speed. For a player of his build, he is effective in gaining speed and maneuvering at this top speed. He sometimes creates too much upper-body motion due to pitchforking his stick but he's much smoother and more powerful stride when he drops his stick. He shows presence of mind to get off the wall and in between the dots where he can come down the funnel to provide a second wave threat offensively, instead of just flinging low-percentage point shots. He's got a fairly effective shot and even though his top hand could be out a little bit more to create a better lever, he's got the heads up approach to pick an effective spot whether it be to pick a corner or to generate a rebound. He's a creative playmaker, demonstrating crisp tape-to-tape passes or impressive behind-the-back passes. He can set up a give-and-go or makes a long, stretch pass to open up the ice. A key component to his game is shoulder checks. He is always surveying the lay of the land which is a crucial component when going back to retrieve pucks and making a play under pressure. He's got deceptive tactics with soft hands and quick feet that allow him to create uncertainty of opponents when he's pressured and allows him to escape. He can get caught on the wrong side of pucks when pinches up ice but he has the fortitude in his skating to slice off inside skating lanes and angle opponents off to the wall and shows an effectiveness with controlling gaps in transition. His impulses would be better served with a little more assertiveness, as he can get caught puck watching and not impose his will to block lanes. In the defensive zone, Hughes does a satisfactory job of covering his zone but definitely gets puck focused and can collapse far too often on the puck, leaving opponents open in space and making them a pass option. Through the 2020-21 season, Hughes was one of the most improved players eligible for the 2021 NHL Draft, raising his draft stock with every game played. Despite a season-ending lacerated tendon from a skate, the prospect has solidified himself as a top player in this class."
2021,RW,72,166,9,ARI,6,Dylan Guenther,"Guenther had a great limited WHL season, scoring two points per game (24 points in 12 games) for the Oil Kings following his great underage season, although his U18 worlds were good but not as inspiring. Guenther is a forward with a lot of NHL attributes. He has great skill, and can make skilled plays through defenders and to teammates at an NHL pace. He can make some plays through seams while also having the shot to score from a distance. He has a lot of talent, but also works off the puck, forcing turnovers and playing in traffic, even if he's not overly physical. In a sentence, Guenther may not be a true game breaker in the NHL, but he projects as a top-line forward who will endear himself to fans and coaches.","Guenther has a multi-faceted offensive package off the flank. Inside the offensive zone, his ability to handle the puck in traffic, play pucks into space, and shape and hide his shot all impress. In transition, he creates off the rush using quick crossovers to build speed and weave through neutral ice as a primary carrier. So he's not only capable of transporting the puck and leading the rush, but he then has the offensive acumen to make things happen once the play slows down inside the offensive zone. Add in a dangerous mid-range wrist shot, good control of his inside and outside edges, the ability to shoot from a variety of stances and there's a lot to like. Though I don't think he's going to be a go-to defensive player at the next level, he also does a good job applying pressure up ice and tracking to support his teammates so that he's a factor without the puck. Believe it or not, though, despite his eye-popping numbers in the WHL (24 points in 12 games in 2020-21), there were some times this season in the AJHL (where he was outshone by Matthew Savoie), WHL, and at U18s when I felt like there was some kind of star quality missing from Guenther's game. I wonder whether he projects more as a second-line creator who can play PP1 than a first-line talent at his ceiling.","If you select Guenther at the 2021 NHL Draft, you are acquiring an outstanding playmaking winger, who possesses the ability to read defensive formations with ease and adjust on the fly. In one of his few games with the Sherwood Park Crusaders, I noticed Guenther implementing a pick and roll like strategy at the blue-line, which allowed his teammate and puck carrier Savoie to skate to the right of Guenther. Guenther used the pick and roll to distract the attackers. He pulled the attackers to him and opened up wide lanes on the right side for Savoie to exploit. He will also draw attackers towards him and flip a pass behind his back to a teammate.

Not only does Guenther come up with strategies on the fly to open up lanes, but his ability to deliver passes from range has come in handy at both the WHL and AJHL levels. Guenther can fire crisp cross ice seam passes, long range passes from the point to the corners and backhand cross ice feeds from half-wall to half-wall. He moves the puck with ease.","An impressive physical presence with great vision, Guenther is a production machine. He tallied 36 points in 23 games split between the Oil Kings, Sherwood Park Crusaders, and under-18 Team Canada in 2020-21; 19 of those points were goals. The versatile winger likes to shoot and shoots hard. A smooth skater -- more quick than outright fast -- Guenther is a challenge to contain in the offensive zone, with and without the puck.

He's going to make some team happy as a top-six/power-play scorer for many seasons to come.","Dylan Guenther drove the Edmonton Oil Kings' first line as a draft-minus-one winger last season, and that had our staff excited for the follow-up. Well, jokes on us. Guenther is playing for the AJHL's Sherwood Park Crusaders for the time being, where his skill level is so drastically higher than that of the competition it's almost comical.

Guenther's wrist shot is an NHL level tool. He centres the puck and generates more than enough downforce to get more than enough lever action on his stick for a quick-strike wrist shot that ought to find itself on the Canadian firearms registry. He's savvy enough off of the puck to find soft ice to release that shot from, too. Guenther's work rate is almost non-existent at times, and that's concerning, but we suspect that's more environmental than anything.","Edmonton Oil Kings winger Dylan Guenther bullied the WHL's Albert Division last season, scoring 24 points (12 goals and 12 assists alike) in 12 games.
That two points per game pace is the best clip anyone's run as a ﬁrst-time draft-eligible skater in the WHL since 1988.
Stop me if you've heard this before, but we need to contextualize those numbers before getting too carried away. The Oil Kings were by far the WHL's best team, in a tie as its highest-scoring one, and they played in the league's weakest division. Guenther played a substantial part in shaping those realities, but there might be some empty-calorie points there, too.
I'm also not going to talk you out of being impressed by those numbers anyway. 
The striking symmetry of those numbers may give way to the assumption that Guenther is a dual-threat scorer, but we don't hold to that belief -- not yet anyway. Our scouts see the Oil Kings winger as a sniper who ﬂashed some growth as a playmaker this season rather than a fully formed dual-threat scorer.
Guenther has every tool necessary to score goals in bunches at the NHL level: One- and two-touch ﬁnishing ability, a wide array of release points, blade deception, and best of all, the skill to get his shot off mid-stride.
“[Guenther] doesn't drag the puck back,” Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting Mitchell  said of his shot in a March game report. “Most of his releases are exploding forward into his shot, increasing power, control, and protecting from backpressure.”
There's just no denying the potency of Guenther's shot. It's already comfortably an NHL calibre tool. He's one of a handful of prospects in this draft who can credibly threaten from range. The sort of player opposing defencemen have to pay just a little more attention to than most.
And on top of that, Guenther has a real knack for ﬁnding soft-ice off of the puck. He's always positioned to collect the biscuit in the soft parts of the offensive zone, a testament to his goal-scorer's savvy. Now, about Guenther's playmaking. The data that  tracked this season may paint his contributions as a distributor in a pretty favourable light, but those numbers don't really align with the tape. Though we saw rare ﬂashes of NHL-level passing from Guenther, the problem is that they were just that -- ﬂashes. Guenther's volume-centric approach as a shooter comes at the expense of creating sequences through his linemates, and he often just ﬂat out misses passing options.
We haven't seen enough from Guenther between the blue lines to conﬁdently project him as an impact transition player at the next level either. So many of his neutral zone rushes are of the straight-line variety, and he's a fairly predictable player as a result. Couple that with about NHL average skating and it's just hard to envision a scenario where he's ever going to be a primary puck-carrier.
It's not hard to imagine a scenario where Guenther thrives in a top-six role as his line's primary ﬁnisher though. Jeremy Davis' pGPS (prospect Graduation Probabilities System) model grants him a 39 percent iXLS (impact Expected Likelihood of Success) based on this season, which 
is about as well as one can hope to do in this range. That same model gives him a 59 percent chance of making it to the show in a full-time capacity period.
We anticipate Guenther will hear his name called a fair bit earlier than where we have him ranked. It's a play that could pay dividends for whichever teams stakes their claim to the Oil Kings sniper. Even if Guenther's a one-dimensional player, his one dimension happens to be the most valuable one in the sport -- scoring goals.
Though Guenther's limitations may keep him from the top of an NHL depth chart, they won't keep him that far from it. Our scouts project Guenther to an NHL second line, and we suspect he'll do just ﬁne as a shoot-ﬁrst winger in that role.","There are a lot of questions as to who would come in at number two in my rankings for the majority of the year. At the end of the day, the Edmonton Oil Kings Dylan Guenther comes in at number two. Guenther has been on the radar of scouts for a while now, and this year was no exception. Even with limited playing time in the WHL, Guenther managed a goal-per-game, and then put up another 4 goals in 7 games at the Under-18's for Team Canada.

Guenther is an absolute sniper, but he is also a well-rounded offensive player. He can run a powerplay and drive play. Guenther plays with tremendous pace and creates a high number of high danger scoring chances. Guenther can score and create offense both off the rush and down-low through cycle play. He possesses excellent hands and overall offensive instincts. Guenther looks like a top-six forward at the NHL level. He is likely a year away from NHL-ready.","Guenther is an elite on and off puck player who has a wide variety of weaponry that he's capable of showing off. Guenther is about as complete of a package you can find in a player but also has room to keep on developing his tools and approach to the game. He's a strong skater who utilizes crossovers effectively to change his routes and gain speed so he can gain momentum into his glide and works well in tight spaces. His ability to make plays through weight shifts and angle his body to protect pucks and move pucks to efficient space so he can make a play is an effective part of his game and is capable of showing off fine motor skills and skill layering. He's a strong dual threat player who is proactive at reading ice to move pucks to space and then timing a route to play off the backs of defenders and manipulating space to jump into open ice to pick up a puck. He's a skilled puck handler who has good body shape when shooting and passing and shows the knack to make proactive decisions and the ability to adapt and solve problems or show some creative edge to his game. He's becoming honed as a shooter and has the ability to open up his body to be a one timer threat and use his wrist shot as a more refined tool where he can quickly collect and pick a spot with some strong mechanics. There are very few weaknesses in his game. Guenther isn't a relentless forechecker and while he is often putting pressure on puck carriers, he holds off just slightly; choosing to keep positioning a priority as well. if Guenther continues to use power moves to the net by lowering his shoulder and retaining possession, he could be even more dangerous. Defensively, there's a hunger to get the puck and turn over play, in which he uses a good stick and sprinkles in some physicality to do so. He can be a bit hasty in getting to some assignments which does leave him in some inopportune spots but the efforts are applauded. Moving forward, he will want more attentiveness to detail sprinkled in and use of methodical angles."
2021,C,73,168,5,CBJ,7,Kent Johnson,"Johnson is the player you want to know about in this year's draft in terms of dynamic skill and playmaking ability. A lot of his puck touches look unique from other players on the ice, with the ability to make between-the-legs and behind-the-back plays look routine. He's a very creative playmaker who can make difficult plays in small areas consistently but can overcomplicate at times. Johnson has a decent wrist shot, which he showed more in junior than college. His game can lack pace and he's not that hard to play against, but I wouldn't call him soft either. In a sentence, Johnson projects as a top-line NHL forward, likely on the wing, who has the most star potential in the draft but also has the most significant physical drawbacks of the top prospects.","I've tried to be careful in evaluating Johnson because he's unequivocally the flashiest player in the draft and his blend of skating and touch can really grab your attention. But the more I've watched him over the last two years, first in the BCHL and then in college, the fonder I've grown of his ability to consistently make difficult plays at high speeds, the kind of plays that eventually separate dynamic top-line NHL players from contributing middle-of-the-roster ones. Johnson's going to play on a power play at every level he ever plays, so the big question with his projection is about five-on-five and whether or not the flashes will be consistent enough to create scoring chances at a high enough clip that some of the other concerns about his game (including his wiry frame and his propensity to try to do too much) are muted. The reality is, though, that the top of this draft class is filled with players who possess unique skill sets inside flawed packages (see: Brandt Clarke and Simon Edvinsson) and Johnson excites me in ways that none of the other forwards do. His ability to play a finesse game with a feathered pass or quick pull through his feet is rare. His hands also flow effortlessly with his feet — he does an incredible job adjusting at high speeds to cut or leap past pressure — helping him make plays in transition or pull defenders into him. There's just an airiness to his game that allows him to breeze around the ice making plays through layers and underneath coverage.","Johnson is as creative as they come. Whether it's passing and shooting between his legs, lacrosse moves, or anything else you'd find on a highlight reel, if you can dream it, he can probably do it. Michigan coach Mel Pearson has a longstanding philosophy of allowing his skilled players freedom to exercise their creativity, and Johnson has undoubtedly benefited from that thus far. More of a playmaker than a goal-scorer, Johnson's passing stands out on almost every shift, whether he's sending a spin pass to a teammate wide open in the slot or finding a lane between three defenders.

Johnson's hands have always been a calling card of his, and they've certainly been on display so far in his NCAA career","A joy to watch, Johnson's skill with the puck and ability to stickhandle around defenders is on another level. A nifty skater, he's one of the most creative playmakers in the draft. (Occasionally he goes overboard in trying to do too much.) A fluid skater and agile in every sense of the term, Johnson will never be a huge figure, but still stands to fill out a bit more.

Accused at times of trying to make the most of each and every opportunity on offense, Johnson often succeeds. During his freshman year, he notched 27 points in 26 games with the University of Michigan.","We had a bit of a tough time placing Kent Johnson. Certainly, his position on our board was one of the more hotly contested ones. His skill level and creativity are unimpeachable. It seems like Johnson lifts me out of my seat at least once a viewing. He's a lot of fun. Fun doesn't always translate to NHL success though. Johnson's game is marred by some bad junior-level habits. He coughs up a lot of pucks. He spends a lot of time on the peripheries. There's a lot to like, but Johnson's game needs a little work to bring out the best in him against NHL competition.","University of Michigan forward Kent Johnson is the player you're looking for at this point in the 2021 NHL Entry Draft If you want high-octane offence and creativity with the puck.
He's an artist with the puck, and the ice is his canvas. Johnson is out there painting Jackson Pollocks with his every manoeuvre. When it all comes together, it's really something special to witness.
Like a well-trained artist, Johnson's creative output is the byproduct of carefully honed techniques and a gifted mind. He handles the puck with his top hand free from his body, pushed forward with precision, quickness, and agility. When he's feeling it, the game looks effortless.
The mental component of these slick moves is just as special. Johnson anticipates player movement so exceptionally well, whether they're teammates or opponents, and lets that mental map of the ice dictate his plan of attack. Slap some hesitation, fakes, and changes of pace on top of that, and it's easy to see how Johnson put up such gaudy numbers as a freshman last season.
“Johnson sends false information to defenders with his body and sticks on every touch,” Elite Prospects lead scout  said in a February game report. “Not with his feet (which is a problem), but the rest of the fakes are there: Head, shoulder, two-feet skate fakes, open/closed blade, fake passes, fake shots.”
“He also uses his body to protect the puck, showing some puck protection mechanics (extended knee, free arm to chuck) that aren't all that effective due to a clear lack of strength, but somewhat projectable.”
Johnson will need to improve as a skater to get the most out of his preternatural gifts as a handler, though. He's a top-heavy skater at present, lacking any real depth to his stride, and he depends far too much on his inside edges for manoeuvrability. His cutbacks don't really gain any separation as a result, and he's not quick enough to be a primary puck-carrier in transition either. The limitations of Johnson's skating stride reveal themselves pretty clearly in the neutral zone data that Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting  collected from the NCAA last season. You would think that a gifted handler like Johnson would create more in space, but that doesn't really bear out in 's data set. He looks decidedly ordinary. There's also the matter of Johnson's propensity to overhandle the puck. Trying to make something happen is one thing. You want star players to have that game-breaking ability, and you don't want them to be shy about using it. Johnson's problem is that it sometimes seems as if he thinks that he's going to break the game open on every puck touch, often missing passing options in far better spots in the process or just running out of space and turning the puck over. He also just does not have the puck protection mechanics in place to cover for this inefﬁciency in his game.
It's easier for Johnson to run out of space than it is most forwards, too. So much of his game occurs on the peripheries of the offensive zone. That hasn't kept him from producing gaudy numbers at the NCAA level, even as an 18-year-old freshman, but it's an area of concern for his long-term projection.
He's also not a particularly solid defensive player at this stage of his career. Johnson's defensive work rate often leaves a lot to be desired, and he doesn't seem quite as interested in leveraging his anticipation to force turnovers as he is for attempting highlight-reel plays.
The skill set at Johnson's disposal is rare, though. It's something to work with if it can be secured at the right point in the draft, even with all the inherent risk in his game. There just aren't many players better equipped to develop into top-six, game-breaking talents in the NHL in this draft.","Part of the Michigan big three (three draft-eligible first-rounder prospects that tore up the NCAA together this season), Johnson averaged over a point-per-game as a freshman this season. Johnson's calling card is offense. During his last season in the BCHL, he averaged almost two points per game and has dominated offensively in every league he has played in.

Johnson has elite hands and is highly skilled with the puck on his stick. In fact, he may have the best hands in the draft. More of a playmaker than a goal-scorer, Johnson loves to use his skill to create space for his teammates. He also has a decent shot and is an excellent skater as well.

What prevents Johnson from being a competitor for the number one slot this season is his lack of pace at times and a need to round out his game a bit more. He has the skills to be a top-end prospect but needs to mature defensively and in rounding out his overall offensive game.

Whoever selects Johnson is getting some raw skill on their hands. If his overall game matures, he will be a top-six forward at the NHL level. Johnson is likely two to three years away from NHL duty.","One of the true play drivers up front in this draft. Johnson is already quite advanced in how he sees ice and thinks the game but has so many areas of his game that he has yet to grow, which is very intriguing for a player as skilled as him. His mental agility and ability to formulate a play by setting up his maneuvers through layers of deception is already at a high level and as a result can sink defenders in the sand. He controls hands by moving hands and feet independently of one another and besides some of the ankle breaking tricks he can pull off when he's at top speed. Johnson shows an ability to be deceptive on the attack, elongate windows intently by taking methodical routes, tracking on angles with his skating and off the puck blending with the play to pop up between checks where he can make a quick play. All plays that are effective now and moving forward to the next level. He does love to carry the puck and move inside the dot line, but he's got a relatively keen eye for knowing when to make a pass, often in a positive area, and then going to his next destination where he can impact the play. He's got the upside of a difference maker and shows that he has the capacity to adapt his style. His vision isn't perfect of course and on occasion, Johnson can get too fancy with the puck and try and force a play that creates a bad turnover. He doesn't seem to get great power from his strides and has a habit of gliding in the offensive zone when he has the puck instead of moving his feet. However, both of these issues should improve with added lower-body strength. He doesn't engage physically enough and has the puck skills to create more turnovers if he can become more consistent staying tight to his check in the defensive zone. He works hard for the puck in battles but would be more effective in tight area situations like the cycle if can continue to add strength to his wiry frame. With his superior traits as they are now, there is much room for Johnson to grow as a player, becoming a more dynamic, well-rounded threat."
2021,D,76,198,6,DET,8,Simon Edvinsson,"Edvinsson was impressive in the junior ranks in Sweden. He was good, but not amazing at varying pro levels and was an anchor for Sweden's U18 team internationally. He stands out instantly as a 6-foot-4 defenseman with legit offensive skill. It's rare to see a player his size lead a rush or make a play off the blue line and dangle through opponents consistently like he does. Edvinsson is also quite a good skater for his size. His straightaway speed is just OK, but he's got great edgework, showing the first step and quick turns to elude pressure and create clean exits and entries. Defensively his size and skating allow him to close gaps and make a lot of stops and he's not afraid to be physical. He's not a dynamic playmaker, but Edvinsson can make the heads-up first pass and shows some power-play poise. In a sentence, Edvinsson projects as a quality top-four defenseman and on a power-play unit with the potential to play higher in an NHL lineup.","Edvinsson's a contradiction and my constant 180s in terms of where I'm at on him relative to the rest of this draft's top prospects are contradicting too. He's just impossible to get a true pulse on. I fell in love with him late last year and then he wowed me enough in a couple of preseason SHL viewings for me to rank him No. 2 at the start of the year. He's a huge defenceman with superb hands and confidence that you can't teach. That's enough to get any scout really, really excited. He tries things, he usually pulls them off, and he's more comfortable handling the puck under pressure than just about any 6-foot-4 teenaged defenceman I've ever watched not named Rasmus Dahlin. But there's also a lot about his game that makes projecting him forward difficult, including the fact that he's got a weak point shot and his forward skating stride can look a little wonky and gangly, splaying from the knees and dragging the toe of his boots. I love his raw tools and traits. I love his aggressiveness (not just with the puck but without it, where he closes gaps quickly and steps up to play physically against the rush). But I worry about the results and some of the kinks. If he can put it all together, he's going to be a unique defenceman who will warrant his inevitably high pick. If he doesn't, though, his development may run into some barriers you don't typically expect a top prospect will face.","His game is built around his physical skill-set. Edvinsson skates so smoothly that he appears languid on ice, yet still blazes past players six inches smaller than him on a regular basis. This translates beautifully when it comes to rushing up ice. His transition game really is something to behold. When he gets the puck on his stick in the defensive zone opposition forwards stomachs go into their throats. And that is understandable. In stride he can scythe through a neutral zone trap as though it is simply beneath him. There really is an air of condescension at times from Edvinsson when he has the puck on his stick, and who can blame him? There are not many players in Swedish juniors who have the ability to stop him fairly once he decides to go.

Edvinsson also has beautiful hands. He can deke as well as most high-skilled forwards, and has the confidence to take on multiple players either through the neutral zone, or once established in the offensive zone.","This massive defender is skilled with the puck and has marvelous hands. A calm (yet not unaggressive) presence on the ice, Edvinsson can boast of holding his own with grown-up pros in Sweden this past season. He moves well enough, especially for such a big guy. With more seasoning -- for example, his shot needs improvement -- Edvinsson should eventually round out into a valuable top-four defender in the NHL. Skating on a top pairing isn't out of the question.","There's a lot of risk with Simon Edvinsson. He reminds our staff of Philip Broberg in that way, which is a word of caution in this space. The decision-making with the puck is just baffling at times. Edvinsson is going to need to clean it up in a big, big way to play NHL minutes.

The skill package at Edvinsson's disposal is pretty special too though. He's an effortless skater and plays at a breakneck pace as a force multiplier on that projectable skill. His offensive instincts and technically skilled passing register on the pros side, too. He needs to improve defensively though.

","Every draft has a Rohrschach test prospect, and Simon Edvinsson is that player for the 2021 NHL Entry Draft.
The range of opinions on this smooth-skating Swedish defenceman couldn't possibly be any more diverse, and wherever one's evaluation lands on that spectrum says more about the scout than the player.
Is Edvinsson the next Philip Broberg? Well, there are doubtless some striking similarities between the two, but it's hardly a perfect comparison.
Is Edvinsson the next Oliver Ekman-Larsson? Probably not, but that comparison wouldn't be without its merits either, I suppose.
However imprecise player comparisons may be, they're inescapable at this time of year. The ones that our staff have heard for Edvinsson run the gambit. Well, outside of the context of his birthplace. Somehow all of Edvinsson's comparable players are Swedish -- go ﬁgure!
Scouts ﬁnd common ground in lamenting Edvinsson's mistakes with the puck. It's a potentially critical ﬂaw in his makeup that could undo an otherwise mighty collection of tools. It's also 
a pretty common ﬂaw in players at this stage in their development, the sort of thing an NHL development staff can ﬁx.
“Even though he is a good stickhandler, he could use some work on his puck decisions,” Elite Prospects Swedish regional scout Jimmy Hamrin wrote in an April game report. “His breakout passing could be better. He overthinks situations and tries to ﬁnd plays that are not there, and in those situations, he sometimes throws the puck out in the neutral zone for his opponents. His best breakouts are when he skates out with the puck. To be more effective he should work on ﬁrst passes to be more precise, determined, simple, and effective.”
As Hamrin notes, Edvinsson is most effective carrying the puck out of the zone. He's uniquely agile for a 6-foot-5 defender, weaponizing fakes, look-offs, hesitations, heel turns, and pushes to dart past hapless forecheckers. He manoeuvres with the puck kept in his hip pocket, with his top hand in control, free from his body. Edvinsson always wants to leave at least one forechecker in his dust, and when you make it look easy as he does, why not? Go off, as the kids say.
He'll take even the slightest opening as an opportunity to sprint up the ice as a puck-carrier. With a smooth and gracious skating stride scaffolded on top of those mechanical handling skills, Edvinsson's tools sometimes take him to rariﬁed air as a puck-carrier.
The data Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting Mitchell  collected from the U18 World Hockey Championships showcases that skill in one easily digestible graph. We've already broached Edvinsson's decision-making and how it sometimes limits his capacity to move the puck up-ice efﬁciently. A big part of that equation is his lack of pace or his sheer inability to modulate his pace according to the on-ice situation.
When Edvinsson is looking to orchestrate a one-man breakout, he's turning play in the opposite direction without any regard for levelling up with his teammates. When he's looking to dish to one of his forwards, he'll just sit back and wait as passing lanes disappear and forecheckers close on his position.
Edvinsson's struggles with pace may be the result of travelling between three separate teams throughout his draft-year. He started the season with FrOlunda's J20 club, and then bounced between FrOlunda's SHL roster and Vasterås IK in the HockeyAllsvenskan. It's hard to know where one's teammates are in pressured situations when their teammates constantly change.
Even so, Edvinsson's pace remains a lingering concern among our staff. It's an area for considerable growth in his game.
In the meantime, there's a really strong foundation in place. Edvinsson is a detailed defender with high-level in-zone instincts, a tight neutral zone gap, well-timed physicality, and supporting instincts to match. His conﬁdence in the offensive zone, whether it's pinching to ","As high as number two on some lists, Edvinsson comes in at number seven on mine. This may come as a surprise to some, but it has more to say about the others on this list than Edvinsson himself.  

Edvinsson, who has drawn comparison to Victor Hedman, is a 6'5 Swedish blue-liner who bounced around a bit between leagues this season. He didn't look out of place at the World Junior Championship and also excelled at the World Under-18's.  

Edvinsson's size obviously stands out, but his skating stride does as well. He is an excellent skater, and many scouts believe his stride will only grow to be more powerful and smooth with time. Overall, he has an excellent toolkit and is an intriguing package of both size and skill.

The question surrounding Edvinsson is his upside and if he can put it all together. He also bounced around leagues quite a bit this season and failed to dominate at the Under-18's, though he did play well overall against his peers.  

Overall, Edvinsson is a solid top ten pick in this year's draft. If everything comes together, he could be a top-four two-way defender at the NHL level.","What stands out about Edvinsson's game is the phenomenal fluidity in his skating stride and how effortlessly he's able to move around the ice, especially for a six-foot-four player. He is able to generate speed quickly and effortlessly with just a few long strides while demonstrating great control with his edges, using crossovers to quickly change direction. The transitional upside with Edvinsson is enormous, as he's most effective on the ice at moving pucks up the ice and securing zone exits and entries with control. He consistently has his head up while handling the puck and does well at evading pressure from oncoming forecheckers, using his edgework, puck skills, and long reach to turn away from opposing attackers while also being willing to make simple, small passes to teammates to efficiently move pucks. He has very soft hands for a big defenseman, able to handle and protect the puck well in tight spaces. Having that long reach to add to his quick hands make him very effective and hard to take the puck off. Edvinsson passes the puck very well while in transition, as an accurate passer, connecting tape-to-tape very consistently, making it easy on teammates to receive passes. He does very well while under pressure, staying calm and focused on the play ahead of him, rarely ever looking overwhelmed. One thing he will need to manage better are his decision making on when to pinch, as he's very aggressive, which at times forces him out of position and leaving his team vulnerable on an odd-man rush. Edvinsson is a talented enough skater to keep up with opposing attackers while skating backward, though there are occasions where he shows difficulties controlling gaps on faster opponents. This is likey a cause from lapse in defensive reads rather than an indictment on his skating. The biggest area for improvement for Edvinsson is his in-zone defensive awareness. The defender can get caught puck watching while in his own zone, allowing passing lanes to open up around him by failing to keep his head on a swivel and keeping track of opposing attackers away from the puck. Edvinsson competes hard and is willing to play hard on opposing attackers in his own zone, but his overall awareness and ability to read and react properly to opposing offenses in his own zone is an issue that will need to be ironed out as he transitions to North American hockey. At the same time, the defender played 11 games in the SHL and 20 games in the HockeyAllsvenskan this season, the top-two men's leagues in Sweden, which should aid in his transition to that North American professional game."
2021,C,73,196,3,ANA,9,Mason Mctavish,"McTavish was good in Switzerland's second-tier pro league, with the OHL season canceled, and great at the U18 worlds for Canada. McTavish has always shown he can score — and in numbers. He can attack defenses in numerous ways in the offensive zone with his NHL-caliber skill, vision and shot. He is a creative player who tries to make things happen. He has the shot to score from range versus pros and is very good at creating around the net. He works hard enough to win a lot of puck battles. The main flaw in McTavish's skill set is his skating, as he will be OK in the NHL in that regard but will struggle to create separation. In a sentence, McTavish projects as a strong top-six forward in the NHL, a second-line center or a low-end first-line wing.","There are players in every draft class who really grab the limelight as the year progresses. In 2020, it was Jake Sanderson, Jack Quinn and Seth Jarvis. In 2019, it was Moritz Seider. And while McTavish was a top prospect in his own right growing up and into his rookie season in the OHL last year, he did a lot in a short amount of time to become that player in this draft. It really crescendoed in a big performance at U18 worlds, but I would argue that McTavish's best hockey of this season came in the final games of the regular season and into the Swiss League playoffs with Olten. After a slow start, he became a force in Switzerland's second-tier pro league, overwhelming players sometimes twice his age with his size and his heaviness. It can be hard to spot “competitiveness” in players and I think we can think we see it and then place too much emphasis on it when we do, but McTavish is a competitive, heavyset player with an NHL shot and a middle-lane approach. He's going to need to work to stay in top shape throughout his career and there are still times when I think he can tunnel-vision, but he's got a real case to be taken in the draft's first half-dozen picks and I doubt he's still available at this ranking.","When you are watching McTavish, the zone that you most notice him in is the offensive zone. McTavish constantly is looking for the opposition to pull closer towards the perimeter. He looks for opportunities where his teammates are controlling the puck in low danger. McTavish wants the puck in low danger and the opposition playing tight at the perimeter. He wants that because the opposition is not paying close attention to the slot. So, he picks the moment when the opposition is coming closer to the point as the moment where he skates up to the high slot and gives his team an open man close to the net.
n the defensive zone, McTavish is strong on the back-check. When deployed on the wing, he shows off his physical grittiness and can be a hand full for wingers and defenders running the cycle along the boards. But, when he is utilized at center, he plays more of an insurance support role and won't appear to be as gritty.
We've touched on McTavish's stride extension a few times throughout the report, so I'm going to keep that section relatively short.

Even though there are some power skating issues, he has worked on his skate extension since last season with Peterborough and I have seen him use a couple of lengthy first steps in the offensive zone when going to chase after a loose puck.","Before a star turn at the IIHF under-18 championship this year, McTavish attracted positive attention by scoring nine goals and two assists in 13 games against professionals in Switzerland. Armed with a vicious and deceptive wrist shot, he's exceptionally dangerous in the low slot or, preferably, in and around the crease, banging in a rebound.

Eager to exploit his size -- this young man is solid -- McTavish plays heavy and doesn't back down from the nastier work in the corners or, again, in front of an opposing goaltender. While only a so-so skater, the Swiss-born Canadian is an adept passer and a tough and skilled customer, with and without the puck.","Mason McTavish thinks the game at such an absurdly high level, it's almost enough to make us forego any concerns about a wildly inefficient, poor skating stride. He's a playmaking centre with a great knack for small-area passes.","Mason McTavish may not be the best two-way centre in the draft, but he really isn't that far
The more eyes our group set on McTavish, the more conﬁdent we became in our evaluation. Eventually, that resulted in McTavish ascending to ﬁfth overall in our post-U18 World Hockey Championships ranking. That's where he'll ﬁnish the season, too.
There just aren't many more reliable players in this draft than McTavish. He makes the right play at the right time and in the right place every single shift. You know what you're getting from him every time he steps onto the ice.
McTavish hardly sacriﬁces any skill for that consistency either. He's never going to manipulate opponents in space like Matthew Beniers, William Eklund, or even Fabian Lysell, but his small area game is right up there with the best in this class.
Here's what makes McTavish so special, though. It's not that he dominates in the small area game with dazzling 10-bell manoeuvres, swashbuckling his way through defenders. It's that he courts contact, using it as a means to create space. His ability to weaponize physicality and manipulate defenders is so advanced for a player this age.
“Some wall-play details in this game from McTavish (again),” one of our lead scouts, , remarked in a game report from the U18s. “He moves one way, drags the defender that way, makes them turn their feet, and then passes to supporting teammates in the opposite direction.”
“He seems to have an instinct for it in small areas. He also gets off the wall to attack inside and plays the goal-line role well on the power play; he spins from his position to attack the net and has a knack for ﬁnding holes in the goalie as he does it.”
If that weren't enough, McTavish's unrelenting work rate makes him a constant threat without the puck, too. His off-the-puck pace, in particular, stands out as a distinctly positive quality.
“When he doesn't have the puck, he's shoulder checking in the defensive zone,” our lead OHL scout Rachel Doerrie remarked in a game report. “In the offensive zone, he hunts it like a dog on a bone. It's fantastic to watch, and will be very effective at the next level.”
He's one of the draft's legitimate dual-threat scorers. The data that EliteProspects Dir. of North American Scouting  collected from McTavish's play at the U18s has him calibrated as more of a playmaker than a sniper, though. There are some goal-scorer's tools in McTavish's toolbox. He's a net-front driven forward with a real knack for pouncing on loose pucks and banging rebounds home. He draws from a wide array of releases, employing the one-timer, catch-and-release, and two-touch shots, sometimes with a little blade deception, too.
For all of McTavish's projectable offensive components, perhaps no part of his game is quite as reﬁned as his in-zone defensive play. He reloads high early, doesn't cheat, uses his reach to steal pucks, consistently scans for threats, and is an unrelenting physical force along the boards.
We have to broach McTavish's limitations as well though. That conversation starts with his skating. He's hardly moving like a Mark 1 tank at the Battle of the Somme, but McTavish's upright skating stride with a lack of limb bend limits his explosiveness in space. For all of his plus-level habits to manoeuvre in small area scenarios, McTavish just isn't all that dynamic with the puck either.
To McTavish's credit, he's aware of his limitations, and he plays within them. There's something to be said for that level of self-awareness at an age where that's not an especially common trait.
Give it some time and McTavish has the potential to play as a No. 2 centre in some lucky lineup. He's going to take tough matchups, feature in both phases of special teams, and bring more than his fair share of secondary offence to the table.","McTavish was a victim of the OHL shut down last season. While he did play some games for a lower league in Switzerland, he looked most dominant at the World Under-18's, putting up 11 points in 7 games.  

There is a lot to like about McTavish's game. At 6'2, 207, he is already physically mature. At 17, he scored 29 goals in the OHL last season, showing he has some great natural goal-scoring ability. McTavish has an excellent shot and he is incredibly creative offensively.  

What makes McTavish stand out in comparison to other players with similar skill sets is his drive and competitiveness. He rarely gives up on plays and is tenacious on the forecheck. McTavish loves crashing the net and putting himself in tough areas to create scoring opportunities. The combination of both skill, competitiveness, and tenacity puts McTavish as a potential top 10 candidate in this year's draft and his overall package stands out.

Some scouts have some concerns over McTavish's skating. While he may not have the top-end speed of other prospects, his game doesn't primarily rely on it to succeed. His top speed looks high enough to not be a detriment at the NHL level. McTavish projects as a top-six forward at the NHL and is likely a year to two years away from competing for a roster spot.
",
2021,G,75,198,19,MIN,10,Jesper Wallstedt,"Wallstedt started off very well, as a rare first-year draft-eligible to not only play but also excel in the SHL. He fell off in the second half, but his body of work between junior, pro and international is quite strong. Wallstedt's athletic toolkit doesn't jump out at you immediately. He's about 6-foot-3 and moves well but not at an elite level. What makes him such a good goaltender is his tremendous sense and puck-tracking ability. He makes the right read at a remarkably high frequency, with little unnecessary movement in net. Wallstedt can make a tough save when he needs to and has some lateral quickness, but it often seems like he doesn't have to adjust his technique much on a given save, especially when the puck is in the high-percentage areas. In a sentence, Wallstedt projects as a quality NHL starting goaltender.","Wallstedt finally showed signs that he was human late in the SHL season, surrendering 13 goals on the 70 shots he faced across his final four appearances of the year (a .814 save percentage). Before that, though, he had only ever looked like a manufactured goaltending robot, the kind who checked every single box. I had nitpicks about recent first-round goalies Spencer Knight and Yaroslav Askarov that I just don't really have about Wallstedt. The only areas where his game doesn't get an A grade is probably in his lateral explosiveness and agility on his feet (which are the strengths of Askarov's game, as well as Marc-Andre Fleury's and Jonathan Quick's). There's power in his pushes and he's quick enough on his feet (he's certainly not slow) but Wallstedt's game is built on the foundations of most other NHL goalies today: He fills the net, he plays sharp angles, he swallows his rebounds, his movement is compact, and he reads a shooter and his options so well that he rarely has to scramble.","So, what allows Wallstedt to have such great success at such a tender age? How is it that when most talented goalies his age are giving inconsistent performances at a junior level Wallstedt is shutting down men in one of the worlds best leagues?

First and foremost – somewhat appropriately considering he lives just 90 miles south of the Arctic Circle – the Stockholm born prospect is so cool as to appear ice cold between the posts. It does not seem that anything can ruffle his feathers. A crowded crease, one-on-ones, a barrage of shots, or quiet periods. No matter what is happening in front of him Wallstedt is locked in. His poise is exceptional.

Alongside his mental fortitude, the Swede possesses a technical game that most NHL starters would be jealous of. He rarely needs to make big saves, or rely on athleticism, because his skating ability and anticipation leave him in the perfect position to deal with shots simply the majority of the time. As with most modern goalies his base set is Reverse-VH when players get in close on his peripheries, and he is a master at the age of 18.

Unlike a lot of goalies who use it habitually, Wallstedt virtually never “jumps the gun” in terms of when to drop into it. So only exposes his upper corner when the angle of shot is extremely acute. Part of that also might be due to how big he manages to make himself when covering his posts. Wallstedt is no Vasilevskiy or Bishop size-wise, but he uses every inch of his 6'3 frame exceptionally well. He looks bigger than he is between the pipes as a result.

His ability to get himself into position no matter what the situation means that he deals with incoming pucks from all angles well, not just in terms of making the initial save, but also ensuring no rebounds. Smaht Scouting's Josh Tessler has been tracking the NHL 2021 draft eligible goalies, and from a statistical perspective Wallstedt has allowed less rebounds that virtually every other goalie who will be eligible in 2021. When you account for the fact that Wallstedt is playing against men and the others against players their own age that is even more impressive. The young Swede just gobbles up shots, and has an amazing ability to get shots in awkward areas down on ice in-front of him, or trapped in his equipment.

On top of his mental game and technical prowess, Wallstedt also has one of the best gloves you will see for a young goalie. Often, this aspect of a net-minders game can take the longest time to develop. So many goalie prospects have issues, especially in the low glove area, where not being set can leave a gap that is hard to cover. But with Wallstedt's technically ability, alongside fantastic hand-eye coordination, he plucks the puck out of the air with ease, even on shots that are hard and accurate. His glove-work through traffic is also a joy to behold as he tracks the puck and shuts play down inside his Bauer trapper.

As for his puck-handling? In a day and age where – partially due to the trapezoid – many goalies struggle with the puck on their stick Wallstedt is an exception. He grew up playing both goalie and skater, and his puck-handling makes you think he could have been a success had he never decided to don the mask. Impervious to pressure with the puck on his stick behind the net, Wallstedt can deceive forwards and is comfortable passing both forehand and backhand. At times he acts as effectively a third defenseman, and it is not a rare site seeing him head out of net to claim loose pucks in-front of him and dish out pin-point passes. Effecting a clean break-out I something he has in his arsenal that most goalies don't.

So what are the issues? What needs work? Well, not much. That is exactly why he might go top ten in the draft. From a technical standpoint he can sometimes over-angle his blocker, which means pucks end up closer to him that they should be, but this is a minor issue and one that would not even be raised with most goalies.

The only major question? His athleticism. Simply put, Wallstedt is not Askarov or Knight in that area. He is not “as” quick up and down or side-to-side as many high-end goalie talents, though he compensates for this heavily with his skating and lower-body strength, especially going laterally where he can push off the post. Sure, he “can” make some amazing saves, but he cannot recover as well as some goalies.","This year's No. 1-ranked goalie prospect might be special enough to merit selection as a top-five pick overall. A cool and collected presence, he's big, athletic, and perpetually well-positioned. Gifted with an incredibly high hockey IQ, Wallstedt's ability to read the action out front offers a valuable edge against even the most dangerous scoring skaters.

The recent season spent in the top Swedish pro league -- where he managed well, especially early on -- will only help to accelerate his inevitable march to an NHL crease.","There probably isn't that much space between Jesper Wallstedt this year and Yaroslav Askarov last season. Certainly, a cursory glance at Wallstedt's numbers holding down a platoon role for Luleå in the SHL makes the comparison seem reasonable enough. Wallstedt may not have elite NHL goaltender upside, but our scouts see someone almost destined for a career as, at the very least, an above-average starter.","The only reason that Jesper Wallstedt's hype hasn't ascended to the same rariﬁed air as Yaroslav Askarov and Spencer Knight in seasons past is that he's entering the draft in a year shrouded in unknowns.
In some respects, Wallstedt was one of the fortunate ones. Playing with Luleå in the SHL for the balance of the year offered him a shot at regular game action, and he even cracked the Swedish roster at the World Juniors.
He made the most of those opportunities. Wallstedt took the starting job in Luleå and featured in a platoon role with Hugo Alnefelt for Sweden's U20 roster. Those performances showed that Wallstedt is just a little bit more mature than most 18-year-old goaltenders. They also helped display his readiness for North American professional hockey sooner than later. Coaches and scouts alike rave over Wallstedt's technique. It looked sharp early in his career and has only continued to improve as he climbed from the Swedish junior circuit to its top professional men's league. He's a strong, ﬂuid skater in the crease, and doesn't mind coming out to challenge oncoming threats. He'll ramp up the aggression when necessary, but only when the moment calls for it. He tracks pucks well. He doesn't get rattled when he makes a mistake. He's even shown the ability to shake some of the more regimented Swedish goaltending techniques when he needs to keep a shooter on their toes.
On top of that, Wallstedt's precise ﬁnding his parameters around the blue paint, and has a fairly evenly distributed ability stop pucks with his hands. Wallstedt is every goalie coach's dream: A great foundation with evidence that he can layer new tricks on top of it, too.
With a few notable exceptions, most Swedish-developed goaltenders share a handful of traits in their games — and while Wallstedt embodies a lot of Sweden's best attributes in net, he can also fall victim to some of the country's weaker habits in net when he's not at the top of his game.
His ﬂuid lower-body movements don't leave a tonne of room for creativity, which has left him looking beatable at times when facing trickier offensive plays. And perhaps his biggest ﬂaw 
is his play from his knees; on far too many goals allowed while going through tracked games, Wallstedt struggled with dropping a bit too early and opening up the top of the net.
His depth management is both a strength and a weakness for this speciﬁc reason; while he rarely allows the play to sneak behind him, he doesn't take up a ton of room up top. 
Overall, though, Wallstedt remains the best goaltender in the class for a reason. He put up commendable numbers in one of Europe's best men's leagues and played lights out in limited action for Sweden at the World Juniors. You're looking at someone with the potential to be a top-10 starter in the NHL with a little time.","Twice in the last two years, I have had a goalie in my top 10. This is a rather strange experience for me, especially considering the volatility surrounding goalie projections. However, like Askarov last year, it's rare that a player with such a high skillset comes along and, like Askarov, I could easily see Wallstedt approaching the top 10 in the draft.

At 6'3, 215, Wallstedt is already physically mature, a huge plus for a goalie in today's NHL. On top of that, it's his ability to read the play and adjust accordingly that really stands out. Rather than constantly reacting, Wallstedt is able to anticipate the play at an elite level. This allows him to use his excellent technical skills to square up to the shooter and look bigger in the net than he actually is. He is also incredibly calm and rarely panics, a rarity for such a young goaltender.

Wallstedt has already played at Sweden's highest and played the most games of any goalie for Lulea. Like Askarov last season, Wallstedt is a game-changing type goaltender. Any team selecting him is getting a bona-fide number one goalie in the near future.","Calm, cool and collected, Wallstedt is excellent positionally and highly poised in the net. As the puck approaches his net he comes out to the top of his crease and does well to stay with the play positionally. His awareness of the play is also something that stands out and is an elite part of his game. Wallstedt's head is constantly swivelling, looking at the options the puck carrier has and prepares himself to change positions to make the save. Even though he has incredible anticipation he also doesn't cheat on the play and has incredible timing. His lateral movement is smooth but almost too laid back, at times he seems so comfortable and calm in the net that he almost looks bored when shifting posts at times. In addition to his good mental and physical capabilities, Wallstedt was actively coming out of his net to play the puck and rarely made mistakes with the puck on his stick. Once again, he shows, calm poise when under pressure and often makes a good smart pass to a teammate to help aide the breakout. His size and tight positioning allow him to naturally cover a huge portion of the net, even when he drops to his knees. There are no wasted movements and he doesn't scramble when traffic comes to his crease. He holds his posts well and covers the lower net to deny jam plays. His rebound control is incredibly advanced for a goaltender of his age. He isn't the quickest at moving around in his crease, but his movements are controlled and smooth. Wallstedt will need to be quicker in his movements, especially when projecting out to the top of his crease to cut down shooting angles. His glove hand could also be better, as he looks a little too reliant on staying square and hoping the puck hits his glove as opposed to actually catching it, which works a lot of the time but not all the time. The Swedish netminder spent his entire season in the SHL, an incredible feat for a draft-eligible goaltender in its own right, even taking over the starting role for a portion of the season."
2021,RW,71,176,20,BOS,11,Fabian Lysell,"Lysell was up and down this season after a great underage season, moving from Frolunda to Lulea midseason where he didn't play much but ended strong at the U18 worlds. Lysell is one of the more talented players in the draft, who beats defenders consistently with his puckhandling displays. That he's a great skater, with both good speed and edgework and can make very skilled plays at full flight, makes him a handful to defend. On his best shift, Lysell is using his skill and speed to get around guys and take pucks to the net, or making tremendous plays with pace to his teammates. His physical effort comes and goes off the puck, but with the puck he plays with courage. In a sentence, Lysell projects as a second-line winger who has the talent to dominate an NHL shift but may frustrate observers too.","If you were to create a highlight pack for each of the draft's top forwards, Lysell's would probably be the most impressive. He's the only player who flairs like Johnson, and he's not a one-trick pony, either. He can dance a defender by pulling pucks through his wide stance and across his body to beat them with a lateral cut/leap. He can dance defenders to the outside with his high-end top speed or a quick change of pace (both of which grade out at or near the top of this draft. He's got cuts, and stops and starts, and directional changes. His shot has started to pop more, as well. He's also a puck thief who has impressed me with his diligence on backpressure and his ability to jump into seams to intercept passes. I do think he can come and go in games and try to do too much, though, and I worry that his effectiveness may wane against pros as his ability to flash and dash is diminished. There's no question his skating will translate. He comes at you in waves and his pace can catch defenders sleeping. But there are times when he can look like he's playing a little too much on instinct and I'd like him to be more inventive (he's got plenty of creativity when he slows down!). He's also going to need to learn to operate a little differently to be effective at higher levels and his production (three points in 26 SHL games in 2020-21) doesn't align with the “wow” factor of the moments.","Dynamic is an understatement when it comes to Lysell. His combination of hands and speed are breath-taking. It is rare for even an experienced, skilled, NHL player to have the puck control, poise and confidence to make the moves Lysell does with ease in full-stride. Puck-on-a-string comes to mind. His feel make it seems like he was born with a stick in his hands, or simply that it is an extension of his body itself. Even good defensemen at the u-18 international level get a deer-in-headlights look when Lysell picks their side of ice to attack. For good reason. He often makes them look like pee-wee players as they end up a foot-note in an ever expanding highlight reel.

Then there is his finishing. Not only can he carve through a whole team, but when he gets to the slot or goal-mouth he is clinical. He has a good release that is deceptive. It seems at times as though he is only half-way through a move when he turns his hands back over and flicks a puck past a statue-esque goalie. His wrist-shot is lethal, and his back-hand is amongst the best of any draft eligible. What is scary is that he could improve his technique on his shooting as well. He overbalances at times and the velocity is reduced as a result.

But he is not just a speedy sharp-shooter with silky hands. His beautiful touch extends to his passing. That combined with a natural lane-finding ability that Nicklas BackstrOm would not be disappointed with means he is a threat from everywhere. He can find his team-mates anywhere on ice, and shred defenses who manage to keep his speed and shot on the rush in check on the cycle.

So, you ask, what are the downsides to his game? With his all-around explosive offensive tools there has to be a down-side? Well… yes. But maybe not where you would expect.

Defensively he works hard, and is great at picking off passes, disrupting lanes, and turning defense into offense. While no stalwart I would argue that he is at very worst “average” defensively for a winger his age. He is not physical in the slightest, which may draw some into the conclusion he does not commit enough in his own end… but when you key in on him he hustles hard inside his half of ice, and can cover for his center when they get caught up ice. With increased size and strength he could be a positive in his own zone even in the NHL. He has a broad frame for his height, and should be able to add weight going forward without losing any dynamism.

The area he does need to improve in though is, well, to play a more mature game at times. ","A top-tier competitor in transition, Lysell is an excellent skater whose pace rarely slackens. At his most dangerous, he's quick as a lightning bug and is difficult to subdue. Lysell's nine points in seven contests at the under-18 championship demonstrated his burgeoning offensive prowess and above-average hands. While there's room for improvement with his shot, and his approach to the game still needs to mature, both will come with seasoning. He's a dynamic player.","Blink, and you just might miss Fabian Lysell. He plays at the highest pace of anyone in this draft class, blending handling skill and plus-skating to weave his way through defensive coverage with relative ease. Some of Lysell's greatest strengths are also hindrances though. His penchant for deceptive passing often crosses the line into recklessness, as a lack of pre-scanning often leads to turnovers. He'll need to change gears from time to time to beat NHL level defenders, too.","Luleå winger Fabian Lysell is one of the most individually skilled players in the 2021 NHL Entry Draft. He plays at a breakneck pace, and doesn't take prisoners. When Lysell is feeling it, there isn't much the opposition can do to stop him.
The fairly ordinary counting stats Lysell accumulated playing for Luleå's men's league team in the SHL -- he ﬁnished the year with two goals and one assist in 26 games playing little more than 7:30 a night according to our partners at InStat Hockey -- may obscure this fact, but don't be fooled. That Lysell spent the majority of the season with Luleå's men's roster period is a special feat, and one that augurs well for his chances of NHL success.
The pGPS (Prospect Graduation Probabilities System) metric developed by Jeremy Davis does a great job of contextualizing Lysell's output last season. Players who produce as Lysell did in the SHL carry a bXLS% (base Expected Likelihood of Success) of 50 percent, and a 20 percent iXLS% (impact Expected Likelihood of Success).
Those ﬁgures may lean towards the low-end for a No. 7-ranked prospect, but that's more of a reﬂection of this year's class than an indictment of Lysell's quality.
Besides, if the numbers don't do it for you, then surely the tape will do the trick.
Lysell's a human highlight reel, a master manipulator who weaponizes layer upon layer of deception to send opposing defenders into the spin cycle.
His skating form is nearly perfect, with great posture, depth, and ﬂexibility at the ankles, knees, and hips, giving him straight-line speed and two-step quickness to burn. Better still, Lysell avails himself of a wide array of rush patterns to keep opposition defenders guessing.
Now, if Lysell changed speeds more often, that would take his rush offence to an even better place. One has to admire Lysell's unrelenting approach to creating offence off of the rush, but his inability to change speeds limits the amount of space he can create for himself and his linemates. It also just makes him plain old predictable
That may seem like a minor quirk to Lysell's game, but correcting it could prove a necessity as he climbs professional hockey's ladder. Defencemen have far too easy a time keeping Lysell and his 5-foot-10 frame to the perimeter, and it's hard to imagine him adding enough muscle to overpower defenders at the next level to break through that barrier. He's going to need to leverage his guile and grace to get inside at the NHL level. Power isn't going to be his calling card.
Though Lysell is doubtless most effective off of the rush, he's pretty effective during sustained offensive zone possessions, too. Lysell spots teammates through layers, and has the deft touch to get them the puck when the time is right.
He's every bit the master manipulator in these scenarios, too. Lead scout  wrote of Lysell in an October game report that he “shows himself deceptive, rocking his shoulders back and forth, swaying with his hips, moving the puck rapidly from one position to the next to remain as unreadable by defenders as possible while he looks for the optimal play.” This may come as a bit of a surprise, but Lysell is a pretty effective defensive player, too. Certainly, he's got the right attitude. He scans regularly, reloads to support his defencemen, tracks well through the neutral zone, and his work rate never wanes.
Overall, Lysell has a pretty enticing collection of tools, and he's shown that he has the offensive instincts to string them together to productive ends. His performance for Sweden at the U18 World Hockey Championship stands out as one such occasion; he looked like the most purely talented skater in this draft at points.
The advantage that Lysell's speed and unrelenting pace confer to him at this level won't sustain itself as he moves up the ranks and towards the NHL though. Couple that with a shot that registers as about NHL average, and the projection becomes more fraught.
Even so, Lysell's skill is undeniable, and it sets an almost uniquely high ceiling among the players in this draft that we didn't account for with our ﬁrst four writeups. Reaching that ceiling is going to take a lot of work, but it's worth the trouble.","Lysell has been on the radar as a prospect for a while now, and he's one of the few who has stayed roughly in the same position as expected at the beginning of the season. Lysell didn't have a great year offensively in Sweden's top league. However, he showed some pretty amazing offensive skills at the World Under-18's and put up 9 points in 7 games.

Lysell's calling card is his offense. He is diminutive in stature, but it also makes him slippery in the offensive zone. He has excellent one-on-one skills and possesses high-end speed. His shot is elusive and he isn't afraid to rip it from anywhere. He also uses his edges well in-tight. More of a goal-scorer than a playmaker, offense will always be Lysell's forte.

Some scouts are concerned with Lysell's lack of production this season outside of the Under-18's, though it may be more of a result of coaching and on-ice utilization (Carolina prospect Noel Gunler had similar issues last season and actually left the team). There are some questions about Lysell's defensive play as well. However, with such high-end skill, it would be hard to pass on Lysell in the mid-first round and it is an area that could be improved upon.

Lysell projects as a top-six, goal-scoring forward at the NHL level. He will need a few seasons of development before making the NHL jump.","Lysell is a truly electric talent, using his fantastic speed, hands and hockey sense to blaze around the ice and make dramatic things happen. He is a machine when it comes to zone exits and entries, taking no time at all to hit his excellent top gear while also having the hands and the crossovers to smoothly dart around or through traffic. Not only can he play fast, he also knows where to go and where his teammates are headed. Even more impressive, he's not just blindly trying to go fast all the time, as he picks the right situations to stop, curl and set things up for his team in the offensive zone. He's equally as dangerous in the cycle as on the rush, as he can circle the zone and play keep-away with the puck until he finds an opening. His passes are crisp and accurate, and he can make backhands, saucers and backhand sauces all look easy. He makes the job of opposing defenders extra difficult thanks to a great motor and a competitive focus, allowing him to go for a second end-to-end rush in a single shift if the first one doesn't pan out. He also routinely applies his motor and work ethic on the backcheck. He lacks size and strength, but his elite awareness and slipperiness should mitigate that problem even after he moves to smaller ice. There is, however, one major knock on Lysell, and that's his shot. None of his wrist shot, slapper or one-timer have the power or quickness coming off of his stick to be dangerous, and it's hard to see that changing long-term. Any goals he scores will primarily have to come from carving or sneaking his way to the home plate. When defending, Lysell can stop moving his feet, just reaching with his stick. In doing this, he loses his mobility, his speed, and his balance. When he does get the puck in the defensive zone, he doesn't have that confidence that he has in the offensive zone. He tends to rush the puck, and try to get the puck off of his stick rather than carry it. He can play with a bit of an edge, getting a little frustrated through the game and throwing his body around more and more. Putting on strength and working on his shot will be the main focuses moving forward."
2021,C,72,190,11,CBJ,12,Cole Sillinger,"Sillinger went to the USHL with the WHL's delayed start where he was one of the league's best forwards. Sillinger is a smart player, who can make seam passes consistently and make creative plays due to his great hands and offensive IQ. He can play on the perimeter due to his vision and a great one-timer/wrist shot combo, which he gets off with velocity and accuracy. He can also play inside. He wins battles, gets to the net, is reliable defensively and doesn't shy from playing physically. His skating is an area of concern, with a heavy stride. He likely won't be able to drive entries at the top level. In a sentence, Sillinger projects as a top-six NHL forward, whether at center or the wing, who will bring scoring and physicality elements to a lineup.","Sillinger's one of the players I'm higher on than most in this draft. His biggest asset is that he's got some of the best hands in the draft and he's strong over pucks. So he can beat defenders one-on-one without ever getting touched and then when they do bump him, he's able to shed past and maintain control too. Those skills also complement a wrist shot that pops off of his blade in line with the two other best shooters in the draft (Lucius and McTavish). Where Lucius' goal-scoring ability is about his release point and his accuracy, and McTavish's is about how hard he shoots it, Sillinger is somewhere in the middle. He's always engaged in the play, he can outmuscle his man along the wall to win back pucks, his head is always up and identifying his options, and the skill is there. He needs to continue to get a little quicker from a standstill (he's powerful once he gets going) but he's a lot to handle offensively and he's going to be a good player off of the puck because of his work ethic and his strength.","I really like Cole Sillinger. It took me a few games as I initially misread his off puck movement as “laziness” or “coasting”. There were some times he really frustrated me as there were opportunities to make high level plays that he passed up on for low probability 1 on 1 encounters. I was seeing the talent but was questionable on his decision making. The more I watched, the more I realized that he can actively contribute in all three zones. Upon rewatching the first few games where I had come away unimpressed, I realized even in these games how his off puck movement and desire to attack open space were creating chances over the ice. He's certainly too good for the USHL and would benefit from playing against better opposition for the sake of his development. All in all, in a draft that severely lacks high octane, dynamic offensive talents Cole Sillinger stands out as one of the top forwards and should certainly be ranked in the lottery for the 2021 NHL draft.","Widely heralded for his lethal wrist shot, Sillinger is one of a handful of elite scoring forwards in this draft. Having bolted the WHL's Medicine Hat Tigers for the U.S. during the pandemic, he potted 24 goals and 22 assists in 31 games for Sioux Falls. He has great hands and reads the game particularly well. His considerable size and strength helps keep defenders at bay, along the boards and in open ice.

While there's room for progress in Sillinger's skating and defensive play, the positives far outweigh those concerns. However, he may end up on the wing in the NHL if he doesn't improve upon the defensive aspects of the game.","Our scouts like just about everything in Cole Sillinger's game (mileage may vary) except for his feet. His shot is the standout tool, and his hands aren't far behind. He's so manipulative, so deceptive, and so advanced in the way that he sets up his maneuvers, and then finishes those plays with relative ease. To quote one of 's reports, ""it's like he's already done with the USHL.""","You won't ﬁnd a better shot in the 2021 NHL Entry Draft than the one Cole Sillinger used to wreak havoc on the USHL last season.
When I say havoc, I really mean it, too. Sillinger scored 24 goals in 31 games for the Sioux Falls Stampede, one of the league's worst, lowest-scoring teams. In a notoriously difﬁcult league for ﬁrst-year players, and that's before one even accounts for the particularly fraught nature of crossing borders and joining new teams in the midst of a pandemic.
Just imagine the sort of numbers Sillinger might've amassed for Team Canada at the U18 World Hockey Championships had a positive COVID test not robbed him of that opportunity.
So, that shot. Let's talk about it. If it's not the best in the class, then Sillinger is right up there. Whether you're looking at his wrist shot, his slap shot, his snapshot, and on, and on -- everything you want to see mechanically is there.
His wrist shot release is especially potent, with a short draw, feet pointed at the net, adequate knee-bend, a hip-snap, his leg kicked back, and exploding from his chest. It's a sight to behold.
As Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting Mitchell  noted in this mid-season proﬁle of Sillinger's game on Rinkside, there's room for improvement there, too.
“Without a doubt, Sillinger's an NHL-calibre shooter,”  wrote. “Improved feet inside the release, particularly the consistency of his foot placement and weight transfer, could take his shot to the next level. A lack of ankle dorsiﬂexion prevents him from making full use of his upper-body mechanics, as improved depth will generate more downward force during release.”
Sillinger makes the best of this shot with some stellar off of the puck instincts, an often overpowering wall game, and a penchant for driving the centre lane of the offensive zone.
He may not boast the prototypical power forward's frame, but don't let his EliteProspects bio fool you into thinking he's a docile offensive zone piece. When Sillinger wants to get the puck to the sensitive portions of the offensive third of the ice, there is sometimes little the opposition can do to stop him. He'll skate through contact, ward off back-pressure, and make plays with opposing defenders draped on top of him. Sillinger's knack for ﬁnding soft-ice can best be displayed with this graph showing his expected goals output from last season, according to the data that  tracked in his viewings. It often seems as if Sillinger relishes physical contact. He'll throw reverse hits. He'll mix it up after the whistle. He'll throw the body on the forecheck. Any excuse to engage the opposition physically is good enough for Sillinger.
The problem is that Sillinger only applied that battle level to the offensive zone. He was a total no-show for Sioux Falls when his team was on the defensive. No scanning, no shoulder-checks, no support. Instead, Sillinger just wandered high in the zone, waiting for his teammates to turn possession in their favour.
According to our partners at InStat Hockey, the Stampede only controlled 47 percent of the shots at 5-on-5 with Sillinger on the ice. Meanwhile, InStat has Sillinger down for 266 puck battles in the offensive zone to just 121 in the defensive zone. His seven defensive zone takeaways rank right near the bottom of the Stampede roster, too.
Shifting gears back to the offensive zone, Sillinger's regression as a playmaker this season was a bit concerning for our staff. Where he once showed real promise as a distributor only a season prior with the Tigers, Sillinger looked like a bit of a one-trick pony for the Stampede. It's not just that Sillinger wasn't ﬁnding his teammates through layers. Even on the rare occasion that he tried to create through his linemates, Sillinger would sail passes well off-target.
Perhaps Sillinger's step back as a distributor can be easily explained by his environment. There just wasn't much in the way of help in the Stampede forward ranks this season. Maybe Sillinger went into each shift with the impression that he had to be the one to put the puck in the back of the net or it wouldn't happen?
That wouldn't be an unreasonable assumption on Sillinger's part regardless of the setting. He's a gifted goal-scorer, with a shot that can credibly threaten from range, some advanced offensive zone habits, and enough muscle to hang in there when the going gets tough.","If Sillinger's name sounds familiar, it's because his father played a ton of games for an obscene number of teams in the NHL. The son of Mike, Cole decided to play in the USHL after it appeared early on there may not be a WHL season.  Sillinger did not disappoint, earning USHL rookie of the year honors and averaging well over a point-per-game. Some credited him for single-handedly getting his team into the playoffs.  

Sillinger is a high-end talent, with an overall well-rounded offensive game. He is considered by many to have an NHL-ready shot. Sillinger puts himself into high danger scoring areas with ease and utilizes his strength to his advantage by holding off defenders down-low. He is considered by many to be a goal-scorer, but he isn't a bad playmaker either. He also isn't afraid to engage physically, which helps round out his game significantly.

Scouts two biggest concerns surrounding Sillinger are his skating and at times, his drive. There are moments when Sillinger can rely on his strength and skill set rather than tenacity to score and create plays, a trait that won't work successfully in the NHL in the way it has in the USHL and WHL. In terms of skating, some scouts wonder about his top-speed and ability to use quickness to pull away from defenders. While his skating may not be explosive, it isn't fully a detriment either.  

The team that selects Sillinger will receive a goal-scoring, potential top-six forward. It is believed Sillinger will return to the WHL next season. He is likely a few seasons away from NHL duty.","Sillinger's puck skill in tight areas is elite and the creativity of his arsenal is quite impressive. What is unique and interesting about him that enables success is how well he sees the ice and how he plans his approach. In support he's constantly above the puck, hunting for an opportunity. This bird's eye view from Sillinger allows him to surf above pucks battles, survey opportunities from high to low and funnel down into space behind coverage, often undetected and ready to make a play on first touch with a quick catch and release play. His aggression to attack space and model rocket approach to building speed is a quick way for him to mask the shortcomings of his skating abilities and attack downhill by timing plays and attacking defenders with manipulative maneuvers in hopes of catching them rooted down and not able to stick with him. His support in the defensive zone is a noticeable feature of his game, he doesn't simply offer passive support. He keeps mobile through support and makes himself a clear option for teammates before making a good exit, or outlet pass. He can receive passes behind his split stride so smoothly or touch a pass to a teammate. Sillinger's attacks often in forward strides and in tight areas shows limited dexterity in gaining room off the inside shoulder of defenders to beat them clean although he shows the proper patience to wait for the cue to make his move. He can push pace when he is busting his butt to join the rush or back check but naturally his stance and form is lacking dynamism. He's got poor ankle flexion and a choppy stride, using relatively few crosses in place of sluggish forward strides which limits explosiveness and deceptive elements linear crossovers would. His skating stride during a glide is a fairly wide but when he's accelerating, he could widen his pushes more to reach a fuller extension. It doesn't seem to hinder him too much on push races when he's springing the d-zone though as he gets to a strong, powerful pace, but it will be something to work on. With the delay of the WHL season, Sillinger opted to head to the USHL, where an impressive season has boosted his draft stock over the year."
2021,C,72,172,17,WPG,13,Chaz Lucius,"Lucius missed most of the season with various injuries but when healthy he showed what he did in his underage season, in that he could score a lot of goals and drive a team's offense. Lucius is one of the most purely skilled players in the draft, with elite one-on-one skills and the ability to make defenders miss. He is known for his goal scoring, but he has good vision and can find seams and create in tight areas. His scoring is less due to an elite shot and where he scores. If you saw a heat map for his shots, it's a big blob in front of the crease. Lucius lacks physicality and defensive value off the puck but he generates a lot of offense by going to the net. His skating is a concern and he will likely not be able to separate at the NHL level. In a sentence, Lucius projects as a strong top-six NHL forward who can be on a top power-play unit in a bumper/net position.","Lucius couldn't catch a break this season. After undergoing surgery to repair a bone lesion in his knee, Lucius spent the first two-thirds of his season rehabbing at home in Minnesota while the national program played on without him in Plymouth, Michigan. Then, after filling the net with 13 goals in 13 games from late February into early April, he wasn't able to go to Texas for U18 worlds when he fell ill with a fever before just before the deadline.

Still, the games he did play reaffirmed what he showed a year ago, which is that he's one of the best goal scorers in the draft. He's not an explosive skater, which leads to apprehension among some scouts as to how his finishing ability will translate at higher paces. But he's an underrated playmaker and passer who understands how to play pucks into space when he draws pressure. He can find pockets inside the offensive zone to get open into when he doesn't have the puck, and uses opposing defenders as decoys when he does.","There's no doubt in my mind Lucius would have been skyrocketing up the mock draft rankings had he been healthy to start the season. Once he gets back to full strength, look for him to light it up for the U-18's, barring a setback. His offensive ability will have teams picking in the middle of the first round salivating at the chance to draft someone with his skillset. Based off his U-17 season, look for Chaz Lucius to be selected anywhere between the 12th and 20th picks.","Lucius is a finisher. While also a fantastic playmaker and great in the faceoff circle, what truly sets him apart is his ability to put the puck in the net, thanks to an excellent shot and remarkable release. That, and his high hockey IQ.

Forced to plow through an injury- and illness-limited season, Lucius still managed to score 13 goals in 13 games. Committed to the University of Minnesota, the gifted forward should set his sights on battling for a top-line gig in the NHL one day.","Chaz Lucius, a member of the All-Names Team, was a hotly contested player in our meeting. Our Dir. of North American Scouting, , swears by his game, but  has some reservations. The lack of viewings hasn't helped us reach a consensus, as Lucius has missed much of the season with a lower-body injury. Lucius' shot really stands out, but he needs to make better decisions with the puck and not waste so many touches.","Chaz Lucius knows better than most that there's something to be said for being in the right place at the right time. It's a legitimate skill, and he coupled it with an elite shot to light the USNTDP circuit on ﬁre last season.
We had to wait a little while to see Lucius put that skill to action, though. He spent the ﬁrst few months of the season nursing a lingering knee injury, only making his debut with the program in a February 19th game against the Chicago Steel.
It didn't take Lucius long to remind everyone why he's a top prospect for the 2021 NHL Entry Draft. He scored twice in his debut against the Steel, then added another three goals in his season-opening four-game goal-scoring streak. Talk about making a great ﬁrst impression.
“First game for Lucius, and what an eventful game it was,” Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting Mitchell  wrote in his report. “In many ways, it was a classic Lucius game. The shot was there, scoring with a powerful one-timer and an in-stride quick-release wrister from a sharp angle.”
That shot is already an NHL calibre weapon. Lucius can work the one- and two-touch snapshot with power and precision. He can send the puck on net with a deceptive, downward force-loaded wrist shot. And he can even let one-timers rip from just about anywhere in the offensive zone. Everything you look for mechanically is there.
His technical skill as a passer is right up there, too. There's only a half-point separating the two tools in our grades sheet for a reason. His vision is great. If someone's open, Lucius is going to ﬁnd them, and he's going to get them the puck. Lucius understands player routes, and always seems to have a creative solution for pushing play in the right direction as a distributor.
Don't discount Lucius' puck skills either. He's a mechanically graceful handler, with his mitts operating independent of his feet, and a free top hand pushed out from his body; the foundation of any gifted puckhandler. It's Lucius' ability to ﬁnd soft-ice that binds all of these tools together into one cohesive, robust package. He reads his teammates so well, anticipating developing plays, and timing his manoeuvres accordingly. He's always in the right place, at the right time, and ready to strike on a moment's notice.
So, what gives? How has such a skilled player fallen all the way to No. 17 overall in the ﬁnal EliteProspects ranking of the 2021 NHL Entry Draft?
You'll ﬁnd out pretty quickly when you parse our game reports. Consistency was a massive problem for Lucius last season. His work rate was a constant source of concern, coming and going on a shift-to-shift basis if it showed up at all.
We could abide by the defensive zone ﬂy-bys, the half-efforts on loose pucks, and the blown coverages easily enough, though. It's not like we're under any delusions about Lucius' NHL projection -- it's pretty clearly as a one-dimensional scoring winger.
The most concerning element of Lucius' game is the lack of pace -- that's what gives us pause. He slows the game down to a crawl nearly every time the puck is on his stick. This lack of pace hasn't kept him from putting up video game numbers for the program, but it might prove prohibitive to even secondary offence at the NHL level.
We're similarly concerned with Lucius' propensity to overhandle the puck. That's his default solution in the face of time or space crunch -- to handle his way out of it. Sometimes you'll get a highlight-reel goal out of those plays, but more often than not, it's just a costly turnover.
Hopefully, Lucius' pace will improve as his conditioning returns to pre-knee injury levels, and his overreliance on handling past opponents lessens with more support at the University of Minnesota. That would make a world of difference for his projection.
Lucius is a player with top-six skill, but he's a little bit raw. He'll need to hone his craft to take those above-average tools and consistently produce offence at the NHL level.","If not for an injury, we may be discussing Lucious as a potential top-five pick. However, after missing the majority of the season, scouts saw glimpses of a potential top ten talent with very few overall games to fully evaluate. It is impossible to overlook Lucius' goal-per-game average, even in a shortened season.  

Goal scoring has been Lucius' specialty, and it will continue to be so at the NHL level. Lucius loves taking shots from the slot area but he also isn't afraid to enter high danger zones. He anticipates the play well, finding ways to create space for himself to rip a quick shot from in close. Lucius excels at getting shots off quickly and he has an incredibly fast release. He is also a decent passer and playmaker and is far from a one-dimensional talent.

One question of weakness is Lucius' skating. It's more average for a prospect and at times seems to lack a high gear. However, thanks to his awareness and positioning, it doesn't seem to have an adverse effect on Lucius' game. Skating is also an area that can be improved upon in the offseason, and injury may have attributed as well.

Overall, Lucius is an intriguing prospect who projects as a potential top-six goal-scorer at the NHL level. He is likely two to three years away from NHL duty.","Lucius is a dynamic offensive player who has shown his high-level skill and production for the stacked US development program. He has a lethal shot, with his go-to snapshot coming off his blade with serious pop and not much of a windup. He shows a tendency to fire from outside the dot lanes and looks very confident with his aim and picking corners. While Lucius has a shoot-first mentality, he is an improving playmaker and uses the threat of his shot to open up passing lanes. His puckhandling and patience with the puck helps him survey the zone and wait for passing lanes to develop, making him a threat to create chances off the cycle. He reads the play well and is highly creative, making it difficult to read what he's going to do with the puck when it's on his stick. His shot is dangerous, but he's also excellent at finding tight passing seams and hitting teammates in open ice, really helping his team use the full sheet of ice. Lucius owns some great edges, allowing him to change directions on a dime. He can change his attack angles and keep up with opponents with relative ease with how mobile he is. His quick feet, good crossovers also allow him to get up to speed quickly and create time and space for himself. He is an excellent puckhandler, regularly beating defenders one-on-one and manipulating space for his linemates in the offensive zone by handling the puck through traffic and physical contact. He can be a little too passive coming back towards his own end, rarely impacting transition as anything more than a trailing forward. Once in the defensive zone, he shows a decent understanding of positioning to support his defensemen, but he's often leaning towards offense and has a tendency to leave the zone early. He has the strength to separate his man from the puck in physical battles, but could do a better job anticipating plays down low. Lucius' area of concern is lack of power in his stride. While he's quick enough to keep up with his linemates and is comfortable making plays at speed, Lucius hasn't taken a noticeable step forward with his first-step explosiveness or leg extension. This may be due to a lower body injury that saw him miss a large portion of the season."
2021,C,72,187,18,NSH,14,Fedor Svechkov,"Svechkov played versus men this season, looked like he belonged at the pro level and had a solid U18 worlds to finish his season. He's very skilled, showing a lot of confidence and creativity as a puckhandler. Svechkov can create for his teammates and shows half-wall playmaking ability to go with the plays he can make at pace. Off the puck, he's physical, responsible defensively and killed penalties at the VHL level. The skating is fine but lacks the true quick twitch in his feet to push defenders back and pressure with speed. In a sentence, Svechkov projects as a middle-six NHL center who provides good value at both ends but may not be a big-time offensive player.","It has taken me some time to come to terms with Svechkov's game. I don't like his stride, which extends back through his toes, hunching him over his feet, instead of back and out through the arches of his feet. He's also not a particularly dynamic offensive presence. He's not scary when he's out there. What he is, though, is one of the most complete hockey players in the draft. He's an excellent defensive player who has a knack for disrupting and lifting pucks, is always in sound position, and supports the play low before he even thinks about going the other way. The latter tool helps him be available for his linemates and involve through the neutral zone without needing to be fast. He also does a good job creating separation with his go-to stop-up to force defenders off of him and allow him to attack back into the space they've left behind. He has also managed to produce at a consistently high level against his peers despite lacking that high-end quality that most first-round forwards possess. He's able to do that for some of the same reasons he's so effective without the puck: A lot of quick, smart plays and his understanding of spacing. I don't want this to position him as unskilled, either, because he's not. He's plenty capable of carrying the puck and making plays in the offensive zone. In fact, against his peers, those tools can sometimes really shine. He made progress in the VHL once he began playing a little less passive there, too. But the real strength of his game is in its details.","Earlier, we briefly brought up Svechkov's robust defensive play, but there is plenty to drool over. First of all, Svechkov is very aggressive to the puck, puts in the same amount effort in every single shift and can be very frustrating for anyone in possession of the puck. With his acceleration and speed, he is electric and will go after the puck no matter the zone.

In the defensive zone, he will do well under duress and can evade the forecheck with ease. He pivots out and wiggles his ways through. He also does a great job putting on the pressure and adjusting to puck movement on the fly. When positioning on the wing, he finds the perfect spot to be in to allow for quick movements when looking to shut down the cycle. If he is defending the rush and trying to keep his opponents in low danger, he deploys tight man on man defense to keep the opponent stuck along the boards.

In terms of his own puck movement and skating up the ice on the rush, sometimes he needs to be more cautious with his decision making. On occasion, he will have an attacker riding alongside him and he will look to deliver a pass through the attackers' legs, he will misread how close the attacker is to him and cause a turnover. There are also times where he positions the puck too far wide, especially around the perimeter and drags the puck further out to low danger along the boards. If he keeps the puck tighter and closer to his body, he will have far more success and will be able to manufacture scoring chances in medium danger.","Methodical and responsible, Svechkov is most often found where he should be on the ice in any given situation. His vision is next-level. Absence of sparkling scoring numbers aside, the solidly built forward is committed to the 200-foot game and serves as a valuable asset in all three zones. He's also committed to SKA St. Petersburg next season, where we'll get a better sense of what he's capable.

Svechkov's 10-point output at the under-18 championship suggests he might have more offensive upside than generally thought.","Fyodor Svechkov plays an honest 200-foot game, and he's already moved on to play productive minutes in the VHL after quickly outgrowing the confines of the MHL. Our QMJHL scout, David St. Louis, caught Svechkov during some of his crossover work and came away thoroughly impressed with his high-level habits and defensive details. Svechkov plays with a fair bit of pace too, which is rare in his neck of the woods. He isn't the most skilled, but there's enough there to get by.","You're not going to ﬁnd many more intelligent, detail-oriented defensive centres in the 2021 NHL Entry Draft than Fyodor Svechkov. Certainly, it's hard to imagine you'll ﬁnd one past this point in the draft.
If you want a player built for tough matchups, killing penalties, and taking critical faceoffs late in games -- Svechkov is your guy. He's going to be a favourite of whichever coach is fortunate enough to place him on their lineup card.
Everything in Svechkov's game starts with his habits. He's always scanning the ice for threats and options when he's off of the puck, maintaining a detailed mental map of the ice so that he's always prepared for what comes next.
“[Svechkov] rarely misses a beat in Ladia's system, taking the right positions at the right times, showing a clear mental separation between offensive sequences and defensive ones,” Elite Prospects lead scout  wrote in a mid-season proﬁle.
“One won't ﬁnd any cheating in Svechkov's game. Where most in his age cohort display a dangerous level of enthusiasm for rush attacks, jumping early from their positions before their team has established control of the puck, Svechkov demonstrates a veteran's patience. He waits for a clear change in possession to move up-ice in a controlled, supportive fashion.”
Svechkov takes great routes off of the puck, rotates above the puck, and often dips low into the defensive zone to create a numbers advantage in support of his teammates. He anticipates opposition routes exceptionally well and makes well-timed interventions on developing plays as they take shape.
Svechkov's game reports are lined almost from the start of the season to its end with “perfect defensive outing,” or some variation of that sentence. He was the best defensive forward every time he stepped over the boards. That consistency was something our scouts really came to admire.
If hockey sense is the force multiplier at every corner of the ice (and Svechkov has that quality in spades…), then a player's work ethic is what elevates their defensive game beyond the sum of its parts. Svechkov's work rate is unimpeachable. He makes second and third efforts where others back off -- whatever it takes to secure possession.
The data that our Dir. of North American Scouting Mitchell  and Dir. of European Scouting Lassi Alanen collected from the U18 World Hockey Championships showcases his admirable defensive effort. Our partners at InStat Hockey tracked on-ice data from that tournament as well, and they also frame Svechkov's contributions as distinctly positive. Russia out-attempted the opposition 134-76, good for a 66 percent ratio of control with Svechkov on the ice at even strength.
It's not enough to just be a sturdy defensive piece in the top half of the ﬁrst round. You need to offer some level of offence at the next level.
Art Ross trophies won't line the walls of the Svechkov estate when he hangs up the skates, but he'll bring more than enough offence to hang in an NHL middle-six. That seems like the ﬂoor for a player this sharp.
The supporting instincts that make Svechkov so effective in the defensive zone are every bit as potent when his team is on the attack. His sense of offensive timing is fantastic, and he has a really great knack for getting open off of the puck. Sometimes, he'll just hide in a defender's blind spot, then spring open for a scoring chance from seemingly out of nowhere.
The SKA forward for the upcoming season deﬁnitely proﬁles as more of a playmaker than 
a ﬁnisher. Svechkov drags defenders into his orbit as a puck-carrier to create space for his linemates. He's a technically skilled distributor -- with the full array of reach-adjusting passes in his arsenal -- able to get the puck to his teammates through layers.
Unfortunately, though, Svechkov's offensive tools grade out as about average almost across the board, save for his 6.5-grade puck skills. That makes for a pretty limited offensive projection. His low pace approach doesn't really help matters in this regard either. Perhaps Svechkov can unlock more offensively if he picks up the pace and develops as a skater -- those two items sometimes go hand in hand. His stride is marred by a leap in his crossovers, a lack of ankle ﬂexion, and an inability to access his outside edges.
That still leaves whichever team drafts Svechkov with a pretty compelling player. He has the potential to be a nightmare for the opposition's best forwards on a night in, night out basis, and score a little secondary offence, too. Every team could use centres like that in their lineup.","In an overall difficult year for prospects, Svechkov used the turmoil to his advantage. Recognized as a high-end talent before the year began, he used every opportunity to his advantage to show why he is a legitimate top 20 talent in this year's draft. He helped Russia to a silver medal at the World Under-18's, producing 10 points in 7 games.

Svechkov is a well-balanced, highly skilled offensive talent. He can play all three forward positions and transitions with ease. He has excellent hockey sense and reads the play well in all zones. While he may not have a definitive “wow” factor, Svechkov makes small plays with ease and makes those around him better. His skill-set translates incredibly well to the NHL level and will be a coach's dream thanks to his well-rounded, defensively conscience game.

Some scouts have some questions surrounding Svechkov's skating, but it is far from a liability. He could grow in strength, but that will come with age and continued physical maturity.

Overall, Svechkov projects as a two-way middle-six forward at the NHL level. He is likely three years away from competing for an NHL roster spot.","Svechkov is the type of player who really excels at the fine details of the game. He's a reliable and consistent player, in all three zones and shift-in, shift-out. He looks very comfortable playing the center position and understands the responsibilities of the role. Even if he's not always successful with what he tries, with or without the puck, he's almost always in the right place and applying the right pressure. His defensive play is very advanced, breaking up plays and stealing pucks at an above-average rate, and he puts in a great effort in 50-50 battles. He shows great hustle in transition and a strong motor when pursuing puck carriers. He is very aggressive pressuring opponents and his strength on the puck is apparent in every defensive shift he takes. He doesn't shy away from physical play but makes good reads on when to finish a check on an opposing player or to make himself an open outlet along the side boards. He isn't afraid to get his hands dirty, including driving to the opposing net. He's not a flashy dangler but he can comfortably control the puck, and there are times where he shows off some nice playmaking. He doesn't seem especially creative or crafty with the puck but he displays solid stickhandling ability. His biggest asset is the ability to draw pressure to himself before making a play, creating space for his linemates and causing confusion for opponents in cycle situations. Svechkov shows no hesitation when firing from range, but seems to get his most threatening chances from inside the home plate area. Svechkov is a powerful and deceptively fast skater, showing great extension in his strides and getting up to top speed quickly with strong crossovers and a wide base. While his agility and edgework at high speed still cause him some trouble when carrying the puck, Svechkov uses his body to protect the puck very well. This is apparent in transition chances, when he regularly attempts to beat defenders wide with his reach and speed instead of attacking them head-on. His speed and agility aren't problems, though they could stand to improve, and on the plus side he still looks a little underdeveloped in terms of his lower-body strength, signalling room for improvement."
2021,RW,71,181,13,CGY,15,Matthew Coronato,"Coronato was one of the best players in the USHL and among the leaders in most offensive categories. Coronato is an undersized forward with a lot of skill who can make plays with pace. He's a strong skater, not elite for a small guy, but good enough to be an NHL player. He's able to create controlled entries with his speed and skill, and make tough plays to his teammates on the move. Coronato is also able to play the half-wall on the power play and find seams as well as finish from distance. He killed penalties for Chicago and works hard enough to advance levels and win battles despite his size. In a sentence, Coronato projects as a versatile second-line NHL winger.","There's no questioning Coronato's effort level or his ability to make something happen in the home-plate area. He's a determined, feisty player with the small-area skill package needed to play that kind of game. He's also got rare spatial awareness which helps him understand where he is in relation to pressure and play off of it. And then he's got a hard, quick release which rattles off of the heel of his blade and great feel around the net. The 57 goals in 59 games (in the USHL regular season and playoffs) are one thing. That earned him USHL Forward of the Year and thrust him into the conversation as a potential front half of the first-round pick. But his game is also about detail, his forechecking presence, and his knack for getting to the right place at the right time. He's also comfortable on both wings, which will serve him well up levels.","Overall, Matthew Coronato is arguably the most offensively productive forward in the 2021 Draft Class. His natural ability to score, or find a teammate who scores is simply remarkable. While he won't stand out in any specific way, he oozes consistency in every aspect of his offensive game. His ability to produce should only become better at the next level, as he'll be lined up with some impressive talent at Harvard in the ECAC this coming fall.

If Coronato can make the necessary tweaks to his game as previously mentioned, look for him to be a solid top 9 forward who can add quite a bit of offensive production for whichever team selects him in the Draft. Based off of his production, you can expect he'll be taken anywhere from 25th, a late first rounder, to 40th, an early/mid second rounder.","It's difficult to find fault with the winger's recent scoring stats. Through 59 games, including a Clark Cup-winning playoff run, Coronato scored 57 goals and 41 assists with the Chicago Steel, in no small part to his terrific shot and ability to get himself into the right place at the right time. In addition to having good hands, Coronato is a creative playmaker -- if occasionally a touch too cute with the puck -- and serves as a responsible asset when called upon defensively.

An average skater, his tenacious approach to the game makes up for that minor shortcoming.",,"Matthew Coronato was, by far, the most productive ﬁrst-time draft-eligible player in the USHL last season, scoring at nearly a goal per game clip and putting up 85 points through 51 regular season contests.
Even in the context of the Chicago Steel's offensive ﬁrestorm of a team, that sort of production commands one's attention. The last player to crest the 45-goal plateau in their ﬁrst year of draft eligibility was Thomas Vanek back in the 2001-02 season, and he scored two fewer goals in two more games.
Some of that offensive output is smoke and mirrors. Let's start with the goals. Our partners 
at InStat Hockey record the exact location of a player's shot to determine their likelihood of becoming a goal and assign an expected goal value to those shots. They have Coronato down for 31 expected goals, 17 short of his actual mark. This seems fair enough considering he's converting on 21 percent of his shots.
It's not uncommon for talented shooters to outproduce their expected goal outputs in lower levels of competition, but even allowing for that, these numbers are outside the bounds of reason.
Now, of course, the takeaway here shouldn't be that Coronato is an empty-calorie scorer or that he's just getting lucky. Nobody is suggesting that. It's just that we need to be careful about how much weight we place on his output.
Because the skills at Coronato's disposal are doubtless special. His hands form the foundation of his offensive proﬁle. He wants to have the puck on his stick and isn't afraid to court contact to make sure he's the one driving the bus for his line. He's decisive, manipulative, and dextrous as a handler.
That's equal parts a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, Coronato has strung together some wonderfully inventive, creative plays in the USHL one AND-1 Mixtape-level dangle at a time. You don't want to ever bet against that sort of pure skill. On the other hand, Coronato's handling base doesn't exactly scream translatable at the NHL level.
“He's always on his inside edges with the puck in front rather than across the hips,” Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting Mitchell  wrote in a mid-season proﬁle. “That position forces him to deke through trafﬁc while making him easier to push to the perimeter. That's reﬂected in his lower success rates and more frequent uncontrolled plays. It also means that he's less likely to change direction and press the inside for a scoring chance, leading to Coronato's more frequent low-percentage shots.”
On the bright side, Coronato has shown some ﬂashes of NHL calibre playmaking. That's one tool in his offensive toolkit that's going to scale up to the NHL.
Coronato starts most plays by dragging as many defenders into his orbit as possible before sending the puck to one of his linemates. He's deceptive, sending false signals through his eyes and upper body to move defenders out of passing lanes before hitting his teammates with a pass. And he's got the technical skill as a passer to make those plays happen. Lob passes, area passes, backhand passes, bank passes -- Coronato has the right setup for every moment.
There isn't anything particularly special about Coronato's shot, which is of course fascinating considering his gaudy scoring rate. It's his work without the puck that makes each shot so threatening. He attacks pockets of space, and has a pretty advanced sense of offensive timing, waiting for just the right moment to charge into soft ice.
“Without the puck, however, he gets inside on defenders and works to be an option for teammates,” Elite Prospects American regional scout  wrote in an April game report. “His goal came from working to get to a soft space between defenders in the 
slot and ripping a curl and drag wrister. He's got a good shot for someone who is constantly throwing pucks on net, his release is fast and he's versatile in how he gets pucks off.”
The NHL is much higher on Coronato than the public sphere, so much so that we anticipate he'll hear his name called among the ﬁrst 15 picks.
The task for Coronato is one of skills reﬁnement, and that's a more appealing draw than ﬁnding a player who lacks game-breaking skill in the ﬁrst place. The ceiling with a player like Coronato extends pretty damn high, but his likelihood of reaching it doesn't look great. We see him as someone more suited to a bottom-six role at the NHL level if things break right.","Coronato may seem high on my list in comparison to others, but I'm a firm believer in his overall game and skillset and should be a top 20 pick in this years' draft. On a loaded Chicago Steel franchise in the USHL, Coronato set the USHL record for goals and while he was surrounded with high-end talent, he still outpaced other drafted NHL prospects and draft eligible players in a season where the USHL had a higher talent pool than normal.

At 5'10 180, Coronato certainly isn't big, but he's strong. He already plays a mature overall game. Coronato is an excellent skater with high-end skills. While his game may not be flashy at times, it is most certainly efficient. What Coronato has proven is his ability to finish. At times, Coronato looks like a player who can drive play. He played in all situations, including the powerplay and on the penalty kill with high levels of success in Chicago.

Some scouts are concerned that Coronato's game may have “maxed out,” and his overall game and offense may not translate at a high level in the NHL. However, few players at his age produce at the rate Coronato has and his well-roundedness will help him transition to different leagues with high speeds and skillsets.   

Coronato projects as a top-six forward. He will play at Harvard next season and will likely need three seasons of development before competing for an NHL spot.","Coronato is dangerous with the puck on his stick and consistently creates offensive chances for his team, having the ability to do it on his own. Contributing big minutes, playing on both the PP and PK, he manages to rarely take his foot off the gas and shows he wants to win. His transition game is really excellent, quickly and efficiently transporting the puck for his team and often gaining the zone with control through the centre lanes. He's particularly effective off the rush, transitioning the play to offense quickly and finding open lanes to enter the offensive zone. He is an above-average skater who lacks top-end acceleration but shows good edgework and elusiveness. He possesses a decent top speed when he gets room to accelerate, particularly circling back through the neutral zone to gain speed and gain the offensive end with control. Strong puckhandler, as he can make moves through traffic and makes quick plays under pressure to keep the play alive. Shows off one-on-one moves to open up space at times but prefers to draw defenders in and then move the puck to an open area. At times he can put his head down and not be scanning his options with the puck. He works himself into a high-pressure area but then throws the puck into open ice hoping to find a teammate. He possesses a decent shot, firing without much windup and finding good spots in the offensive end to set up and present a good shooting target. He could stand to fire the puck more, particularly when outside the home plate area or on an odd-man rush. Defensively, he provides a strong supporting outlet pass along his wing, coming down low into his own end and even circling back through the neutral zone when he doesn't have numbers with him. Corontato shows an active stick when defending in-zone, but his lack of explosiveness in his first few strides makes him less effective when pressuring someone with the puck. Physically, he doesn't shy away from battles and does a good job fighting through checks to make a play with the puck. However, his ability to drive to the middle of the ice and aggressiveness on the back check are areas to improve, both of which should come with added upper-body strength."
2021,D,73,200,26,MIN,16,Carson Lambos,"Lambos has had a fairly up and down year, with more downs than ups as the season progressed. Originally slated to play in the WHL where he was dominant last season, Lambos played games in Finland's top junior league and struggled. When the WHL season began, Lambos only played two games before a medical procedure shut down his season.

What lands Lambos' in my top 20 is his raw upside, even after a down-year. Lambos' skating stands out as a quality, but it's how he uses it which has always drawn my attention and admiration. Lambos uses his speed to skate the puck out of high danger positions in the defensive zone. He also uses it to create space for himself to jump into the play quickly in transition or to move the puck up to a forward with ease. Lambos plays with a high degree of compete and pace. He is also physically mature for his age.

Some of Lambos' biggest struggles this past season involved his defensive play, specifically gap control. Some of this was likely a result of playing on a bigger ice service in Finland, but regardless, Lambos struggled at times to anticipate the speed and attacking ability of forwards, even in a lesser skilled league.  

Defensemen can take a bit longer to develop, and Lambos has the tools to be a top-four defender at the NHL level. Hopefully, next season will provide a better development opportunity for him. He is likely three years away from NHL duty.","It's tough to evaluate how Lambos is trending because he played one of the smaller sample sizes among the better prospects in this draft due to the WHL's delays and an injury, which eventually pulled him out of the league's Regina hub. I liked what I saw of him at Finland's junior level, where he was dominant, but he only played a total of 14:22 in Liiga, so there's not a lot to unravel there. Lambos was stellar for the Ice a year ago and there's a lot to like (and very little to dislike) about his game. He's athletic, he's confident on the attack, he puts himself in a lot of transition sequences, he's sturdy in engagements, his point shot pops, and he's a heady playmaker who is capable of beating the first layer of pressure to make something happen. He doesn't have any one dynamic quality that mirrors the defencemen ranked in front of him but it's not hard to imagine him becoming a relied-upon all-situations defender. The risk, obviously, is that this year slows his trajectory.","The offensive zone is where Lambos truly thrives. When Lambos is at the blue line in the offensive zone and has possession of the puck, you can expect strong lateral movements and crisp passing. If we focus on his lateral movements for a brief second, one of the qualities that I am fond of is Lambos' “happy-feet”. For those who are unaware of what I mean by “happy-feet”, it is Josh Tessler lingo for a defenseman who deploys a rapid stride that allows him to go from side to side at a quick pace. With Lambos' happy-feet, he can quickly skate along the blue line and find teammates to pass to even in traffic. Lambos can use his speed to dodge traffic, find an open lane, pass the puck or take a shot.

In the defensive zone, he deploys tight pressure at the blue line and in his own slot. Lambos' gap control is quite good as he can be tough to out-skate especially along the boards. The only challenge with his gap control that needs to be addressed is his ability to shut down top-notch stick-handlers.","Without question, Lambos didn't play as much as he would have liked this season, due to pandemic challenges and injury. Still, the Canadian defenseman was able to showcase some of his strengths in Finland, particularly with JYP's under-20 squad. Gifted with great speed and mobility, he's difficult to corral or evade in all three zones. His shot from the point is impressive, and he's a strong, aggressive playmaker.

A consistent physical presence, Lambos' approach to the game is bold, and he's altogether a dependable defender.","The move from Winnipeg to TPS' U20 roster hasn't done any favours for Carson Lambos, whose draft stock has plummeted overseas. For about the final two months of last season, Lambos looked like a surefire top-10 pick. We're now at a point where it wouldn't surprise our staff to see him fall out of the first-round entirely.

He's got a great shot, and we saw some really exceptional signs of point activation and puck support in the offensive zone from Lambos in the back-half of last season. We're still seeing the shot, but Lambos' ability to find teammates from the point seems to be diminishing, and his skating remains a long-term concern.","Carson Lambos' season didn't exactly go to plan. He started the year as someone with potential for the top-10 of this year's draft, and couldn't even manage to stop the slide in time to stick in the ﬁrst round by our ﬁnal ranking.
With the WHL on hold, he headed to Finland. There, he showed the same ﬂashes that made him so effective in the WHL, but without much improvement. He played just two games with Winnipeg before having his season cut short due to a medical issue.
Lambos is a potent shooter with the skill and instincts to manipulate defenders and improve his shooting location. With and without the puck, he activates from the point, becoming a passing option and a scoring threat. He fakes shots and passes, waits for the defender to commit, then bursts into the space he created. Constant head fakes add another layer of deception. With hands in front, distance between his feet, and the top elbow elevated, Lambos drags the puck around defenders then ﬁres in one smooth motion. What separates him from other crafty point threats is ability to chain together these moves, like taking the puck in motion to draw the defender wide, hitting the brakes, faking a pass, stepping inside, then ﬁring a curl-and-drag wrister. 
In both the WHL and Finland, Lambos' offensive impact came and went. “He doesn't use his teammates other than to pretend to pass,” Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting Mitchell  wrote in a game report. “He leaves a tonne of value on the table by activating and then taking a shot with an easy-to-hit pass available.”
Nearly a year later, Elite Prospects Dir. of European Scouting Lassi Alanen expressed consistency concerns. “Sometimes he's making proactive plays and activating a lot and then he just stands stationarily and ﬁres off a few wristers for the whole next period.”
Similar skill and inconsistency exists in Lambos' transition game. Just as he does from the point, he manipulates forecheckers and creates space, but suddenly a ﬂip switches and he's throwing away possession with clearances or no-chance passes for the rest of the game. Some of his transition woes come from retrievals and decision-making under back pressure; he doesn't deceive or create an advantage for himself. 
The inconsistency, in part, comes from skating limitations. His posture is mostly too upright, lacking knee bend. His strides are too short with wide recoveries, limiting his push-off power. Despite posture concerns, he could get to NHL average thanks to his backwards skating and crossovers. His puck-handling allows him to mitigate some skating concerns in small-area play, but he must develop his passing to consistently escape pressure at the next level. 
Reports on Lambos' defensive game are scattered, with some positive and many negative. Here's a look at what Lambos' defence looks like when he's locked in, as described by Alanen: “He's always looking to kill off plays early, not giving any space for forwards before closing in on them, sometimes even before they've had time to cross the centerline. He's physically strong and can manhandle players at this level, sometimes with a little effort.” And when it's bad, illustrated by : “failing to scan, letting attackers slip behind him, and so much reaching.”
Lambos might be the draft's biggest wildcard. If he expands upon his draft-minus-one season while improving the skating, he's back on track to become a No. 3 or even 2. If not, he's probably more of a bottom-pairing offensive specialist. ","Lambos has had a fairly up and down year, with more downs than ups as the season progressed. Originally slated to play in the WHL where he was dominant last season, Lambos played games in Finland's top junior league and struggled. When the WHL season began, Lambos only played two games before a medical procedure shut down his season.

What lands Lambos' in my top 20 is his raw upside, even after a down-year. Lambos' skating stands out as a quality, but it's how he uses it which has always drawn my attention and admiration. Lambos uses his speed to skate the puck out of high danger positions in the defensive zone. He also uses it to create space for himself to jump into the play quickly in transition or to move the puck up to a forward with ease. Lambos plays with a high degree of compete and pace. He is also physically mature for his age.

Defensemen can take a bit longer to develop, and Lambos has the tools to be a top-four defender at the NHL level. Hopefully, next season will provide a better development opportunity for him. He is likely three years away from NHL duty.","Lambos is an agile skater who won't blow the doors off with high-end speed but can flip toes with his ability to work off his edges and exploit holes with quick acceleration. He can make quick one touch plays on regular occurrences and hit his mark on passes through motion by working that extra angle. He's an all-situations player who has all the tools to do most jobs efficiently but has somewhat plateaued physically compared to 2019-20 and taken no specific steps forward as far as skill goes. He's not an elite-level skater when it comes to speed or quickness but he really doesn't struggle technically. He's got good use of his edges to carve or pivot under pressure and great stride recovery and extension which allows him some room in a race if he has positional advantages. As far as tools goes, a lot of what he is able to accomplish is due to awareness. He's capable of playing a very controlled and proficient game by parlaying possessions into one-touch passes or by showing the patience to make what he deems as the best option. He can get a bit mundane at times for a player with his skillset and lull games to submission at times and then hit the other end of the spectrum and try to spring a two-zone pass for a transition scoring attempt. While not overly dynamic, his habits limit giveaways as he's strong on the puck and very cognizant of pressure and creates uncertainty with his ability to set up dekes by moving hands and feet independently and analyzing the ice. Defensively, there are a lot of useful tools at his disposal but he just doesn't process the game quick enough. His presence in transition doesn't effectively deter opponents significantly and even though he looks like he's in good spots and not getting drawn into poor ice to chase, he can be hesitant to make moves to close gaps or on the other end of the spectrum, too aggressive to take a check over the puck. That being said, there is some value in his ability to pick apart plays and break pucks up. With the WHL season delayed in 2020-21, Lambos took his talents to Finland. Unlike some prospects that raised their profile, Lambos struggled at times, calling into question the impact that he can make at the next level."
2021,G,78,207,14,DET,17,Sebastian Cossa,"Cossa has been as good as you could have asked him to be in the WHL, dominating the league for the last two seasons. His athletic toolkit is very intriguing as a 6-foot-6 goalie who can move very well for that size. He covers a lot of net with his length. He has some quick twitch in his frame in how he moves around the net, and gets in and out of his butterfly. Cossa's reads are typically great. He loses track of some pucks and can be a bit busy in the net but usually anticipates the play very well. I love his selective aggressiveness with his positioning, and how he takes away angles with his size as well as how well he uses his stick to break up a lot of plays. In a sentence, Cossa projects as a quality NHL starting goaltender with the potential to become an upper-echelon goalie.","Two goalies in my first round!? I know, I know, I know, sacrilegious. For someone who admits to being cautious about his ability to evaluate goalies and rank them accordingly, and who professes to being wary about the ability of NHL clubs to do the same, I'm really high on both of the goalies in this draft (though I think there's still a chance each could be picked higher than where I have them slotted). I think Cossa has benefitted in the last two years from playing behind Oil Kings teams which have done a good job in supporting him, but you don't post a .928 save percentage across 52 games spanning two seasons by accident and you've got my attention when you do it as his size. Bigger goalies often struggle with their movements and their recoveries but neither are an issue for Cossa. His size, positioning (he does a really good job holding his outside edges to be patient on shots) and reflexes help him block and grab a lot of pucks, but it's his ability to bounce back into his stance or change directions with passes that separates him.","Sebastian Cossa is a hybrid goaltender. With his size, he is able to stand tall and make saves with ease. But, on the grand scheme of things, Cossa makes more butterfly saves than saves when standing tall. The majority of his stand up saves come when his opponents are firing shots from low danger/the point. When not facing low danger shots, you can expect Cossa to drop down into a butterfly stance.
Something that Cossa generally struggles with is puck manipulation. On breakaway goals at net front, he can be manipulated and drawn to one side. When it is slightly too late, the attacker will stutter step and shoot on Cossa's other side. That doesn't give Cossa enough time to shift back over.
As we just mentioned in the decision making section, Cossa is a quality passer. 
When Cossa is facing a shot from beyond the perimeter and he has traffic at the crease, he will extend his pad out while in the butterfly to redirect the shot when he knows that he won't be able to grab a hold of the puck. In low danger, when facing a shot, he will use his blocker, stick or pads to push the puck to low danger. If Cossa is defending against a relatively low shot from low danger, he might place his blocker and stick down low in front of his pad to redirect the shot.
In general, Cossa has a good blocker and glove. There is no concern about how he utilizes his glove nor blocker. The only issues that Cossa seems to have with his blocker is that he will get beat on occasion on the top blocker side. ","Even at the junior level, a 17-1-1 record and .941 save-percentage is pretty darn impressive. A huge figure at 6-foot-6, Cossa fills the net effectively. He's also athletic, reads opposing shooters well, and gobbles up potential rebounds with the best of them. The second netminder pegged for selection in this year's first round could very well serve as an NHL No. 1 some day.",,"Game action was hard to come by for most top goaltending prospects in North America, so Sebastian Cossa's 19 starts with the Edmonton Oil Kings put him in an enviable position.
Scouts don't have to lean on priors with Cossa, and his most recent work was pretty special. The Hamilton, Ontario native was accountable for 17 of the Oil King's 20 wins, allowing less than two goals a game, and running a .941 save percentage. For context, those numbers are better than those of Dustin Wolf, Dylan Garand, and Trent Miner, a trio of goalies with draft pedigree.
Granted, the Oil Kings were a dominant team in the WHL's weakest division, but much of that success traces back to Cossa's stabilizing presence in-goal.
Even if size is no longer the sole determining factor of a goalie's draft position, the fact that Cossa stands 6-foot-6 isn't going to hurt his stock either. He manages to get in front of a lot of pucks, even if his technique is a little on the choppy side.
You sometimes wonder about pulling the trigger on a goalie playing behind a heavily structured team like the Oil Kings, but that's not really the case with Cossa. He mixes things up and recovers quickly on rebounds to get in front of multiple shot sequences in order to clear his crease. He's not afraid to use his hands, and does a good job of covering up pucks before they spring loose for scoring chances. It would be nice to see Cossa clean up his technique a bit, but the bright side is that he seems to be aware of his mechanical limitations. He'll use a wide array of save options to match whatever the shooter presents.
As with many large goaltenders, Cossa struggles a bit with his agility. It's worth adding, though, that evaluating a goaltender's progress in that realm was nearly impossible with all the stops, starts, back-to-backs, and shortened nature of this season. It's the sort of thing he can easily ﬁx with time.
For now, he covers any agility-related shortcomings with a level of creativity that is rare among goaltenders at this stage in their development. Where some goaltenders have to rely entirely on their structure to make saves, he's able to break from protocol when the moment calls for it. Cossa is able to throw technique out the window when he can't quite get the same low stance or ﬂuid c-cut that other goaltenders can.
His skating still leaves a bit to be desired, though. Once things have started to return to normal in the coming year, it will be crucial to see if these kinks can get ironed out. 
Assuming his ability to swallow up pucks — even off of unconventional save selections — is tied to a high-level read of the game, he could make a great addition for a team that knows they can build a good system to surround him with.
We anticipate that Cossa will hear his name called much earlier than the 22nd overall pick. With the talent pool shrinking so drastically around the middle of the ﬁrst round -- going from potential top-of-the-lineup players to supporting pieces -- it's easy to understand the appeal of a goalie with a strong chance to start long-term in the NHL.","It's hard to remember the last time I had two goalies ranked in the top 30 of any given draft, but in a draft with a lot of unknowns and unpredictability, two strong prospects have immerged as potential first-round talents. At 6'6, Cossa is most certainly the tallest player in the first round, which is a huge positive for a goaltending prospect.

In 19 games in the WHL, Cossa managed to win 17 of them and put up a mind-blowing .941 save percentage. Unlike other large goaltending prospects, Cossa doesn't only rely on his size for success. Instead, he anticipates the play well and uses his positioning and angles to his advantage. Somehow, with this overall skillset, he regularly makes himself look bigger in the net, frustrating opposing forwards. Cossa can be aggressive or play deep, and his size allows for success in either instance.  

Between his size and instincts, Cossa is a likely first-round pick. He will be a number one goalie at the NHL level.","The best part of Cossa's game is that even when he has an off performance, his game is still about as consistent as they come. His demeanor and approach doesn't seem to change whether he gets 10 or 45 shots and his efficiency in the crease is at an elite level. He's highly athletic but so well positioned that he seldom has to scramble or make a reactionary save because of his attentiveness and vision which allows him to preplan movements. He's a huge kid who plays on his angles and adjusts consistently to eliminate gaps in coverage and always takes the high percentage shots away. Cossa has quick feet and is quick in and out of his butterfly, taking up a massive span and moving laterally with great control of lower and upper body. Rarely does he give up bad pucks or lose sight of rebounds and his glove hand is a strength with consistent positioning with the quickness to adjust and reposition. He does an excellent job of positioning his stick, blocker and pads to court pucks and find dead ice to move rebounds to, seldom putting a putting back in front of his crease and ideal areas for his defense to pick up the loose change. Cossa's tremendously powerful lower body is on display when he anchors to the post and moves laterally. Shows excellent post play and eliminates short side jam plays and can quickly readjust with pucks out front. His physical toolbox is chock-full. Cossa is an imposing and athletic 6-foot-6 and while the size is a plus the fact that it's paired with top level quickness is what really makes him stand out. He has explosive reflexes with his limbs and can lash out with an arm or a leg along with the best of them. He also tracks bounces and caroms very well and can make an unorthodox save when needed. While he has these natural gifts, he is technically very sound and uses his athleticism to bail himself out rather than as a crutch he needs to lean on. He has been guilty of letting in some weak goals stemming from a lack of focus in the past however he really shored that up towards the end of 2019-20 and into 2020-21."
2021,RW,70,167,50,WPG,18,Nikita Chibrikov,"Chibrikov impressed early at the junior level this season, earning a quick promotion to playing versus men where he held his own at the VHL and KHL levels and making an appearance with Russia's senior team. He was also a top scorer at the U18 worlds with 13 points in seven games. He's undersized and not an amazing skater for his size, but he's done well versus pros because of his tremendous playmaking ability and his ability to win battles despite his size. He can make slick one-on-one plays, creative plays under pressure and find seams consistently. He's physical and responsible defensively. He could be a more explosive skater ideally, but the other elements of his game pop. In a sentence, Chibrikov projects as a top-six forward who will be on an NHL power play.","Where many gifted young prospects play loose, flowing games that rely on hanging onto the puck and often playing away from pressure until the right play opens up, Chibrikov plays a direct, more intentional game. Against his peers, that game allows him to attack at and through pressure, create his own chances, and drive play to the inside when he has the puck. When there isn't the same space to attack into or the same openings in coverage against men, his game can really quiet. When he's engaged in the fight and keeping his feet moving, there's a lot to like about his ability to impact a shift (both by ramping up the pace with his skating or slowing the game down to play a little more calculating) in a variety of ways. But I've also come away from some viewings feeling like he wasn't nearly as active or present as he needed to be. He's a bit of an enigma. A strong performance at U18 worlds definitely helped him solidify his stock as a first-rounder, though.","Chibrikov is a highly-skilled playmaking winger with a drive for the centre-lane and sound defensive details
Chibrikov loves to drive to net-front. He will consistently look to drive to net-front with or without the puck. It doesn't matter if it's mid-cycle or off the rush, Chibrikov skates hard to the net. When it comes to getting to the net, Chibrikov has shown at all three Russian hockey levels (KHL, VHL and MHL) that he is more than capable of pushing off attackers, standing his ground and driving to the net without possession of the puck. When doing so, he keeps his stick blade facing parallel to the puck carrier incase the puck carrier passes to him as he charging the net. 
don't forget that Chibrikov is strong in the defensive zone as well.

Chibrikov loves playing tight man-on-man defense and will start to exert dominance in the neutral zone
","An elite skater with exceptional puck-possession skills, Chibrikov is a natural threat to carry and drive the play in the offensive zone. Already stronger than he appears -- and he's got a way to grow in that sense -- the 18-year-old established himself as a potential top-20 draft pick with his strong 13-point showing (in seven games) at the under-18 championship. Scoring a goal and adding an assist in his first season in the KHL also turned heads.

His defensive effort needs work, but such improvement will come with time. A bit of an agitator, Chibrikov will fill a top-six role in the NHL eventually.","Nikita Chibrikov just keeps on putting up points at every level of Russian hockey, all the way from the MHL to the VHL and even 12 games of KHL action. I spoke to one scout who likened Chibrikov's game to that of Rodion Amirov. It's a pretty apt comparison, too. Chibrikov is a highly-skilled playmaking winger with a drive for the centre-lane and sound defensive details. He needs to be a little more careful with the puck, though.","The superstars of tomorrow -- Matvei Mickov, Shane Wright, and Connor Bedard -- occupied the top three spots on the scoring leaderboard at the U18 World Hockey Championships. The fourth-highest scorer? Nikita Chibrikov, eligible for the 2021 NHL Entry Draft. He is the most skilled Russian prospect this year. 
Most opponents might tower over the young forward, but it doesn't matter. If you give him space, a runway through the neutral zone, or a pocket in the offensive end, he will cut around the opposition with a combination of rapid handling and crossovers moves. His skating posture is one of the better in the draft -- his knees bend to 90 degrees and advance past his toes -- and there is creativity in the way he uses that superior tool, changes of speeds and lanes to make defenders hesitate. When there isn't obvious play to make, the forward defaults to cutting through trafﬁc with handling moves. It rarely works against better competition. 
“Chibrikov was great at corralling the poor passes he received and quickly getting the puck back off of his stick.” Elite Prospects Russian regional scout Dylan Grifﬁn said of his performance against the Czech Republic.
“He was attempting a lot of low-percentage passes and dump-ins rather than carrying the puck himself at the beginning of the game, but slowly started to convert to using his strong skating ability to move it. His decision-making was still questionable, though, as he wasn't surveying his options well at all and turning the puck over as a result.” His vision narrows along the boards. He loses track of defenders, imagines them on his back, and struggles to ﬁnd productive outlets. His game lacks a puck protection element, one that isn't based on rapid elusive maneuvers, but shielding abilities that would allow him to make plays inside contact. Chibrikov's lack of off-puck abilities also limits his chances of displaying his skills. Getting open for a pass isn't a strength of his, contrary to his teammate at the U18s, Fyodor Svechkov, whose game is based on attacking space and connecting plays -- abilities we tend to value more than pure skill in our rankings. 
When not directly involved in the play, when not F1 on the forecheck or backcheck or the puck-carrier -- situations in which Chibrikov does show a high motor and some physicality -- he wanders more than he supports teammates, forcing them to do the heavy lifting to get the puck back and up to him. 
The more structured KHL game and its more physical demands could certainly speed up Chibrikov's development of hard skills and supporting abilities, but we don't anticipate such a development. The forward's realistic upside is probably one of a skilled middle-six winger, one who will score more in transition than off the cycle. He will likely need skilled retrievers to maximize his open-ice skill-set.","If there is a player who could be a first-round sleeper, it's Nikita Chibrokov. One of the few 18 year-olds in the KHL, Chibrikov didn't look out of place, though he did struggle to put up points. However, his coming-out party was the Under-18's, where he managed 13 points in 7 games and his skillset stood out.

Chibrikov is a modern-style skilled offensive forward. He is creative, has excellent hands, and is quick. Chibrikov also plays with pace and isn't afraid to dig in the corners or difficult areas on the ice. He has an excellent shot and can play in all situations. Chibrikov's ability makes him a difficult player to handle one-on-one. He also has a deceptive shot and an extra quick release that frequently catches goalies by surprise. Chibrikov's willingness to engage physically and dig for loose pucks in the corners makes him a well-rounded offensive player. Even with his small size, Chibrikov isn't afraid to take on larger forwards to cause turn-overs, a trait that will serve him well at the NHL level.

There are some questions surrounding Chibrikov's ceiling. Some scouts have him pegged as more of a third-line NHL winger. However, with his combination of quickness and overall offensive skill, I believe Chibrikov has the potential to be a top-six scoring winger at the NHL level. He is a few years away from NHL duty.","Chibrikov is a fantastic skater who often displays very good top speed while carrying the puck on his stick, using fluid crossovers to generate speed through the neutral zone and find space in the offensive zone. With lightning acceleration and sublime hands, he is a real threat in transition. Give him too much time and space in open ice and you've got a huge problem on your hands. He as the wheels to beat opponents wide and gain that all-important separation. He's also quite an elusive player, able to slow the pace down, shift his weight seamlessly from side to side, and deceive defenders with his hands, feet or head movement. He shows poise with the puck on his stick and calmness under pressure. He finds his teammates with passes in motion and can maneuver the puck into better shooting lanes. He does a good job of spotting opportunities on offense, finding teammates with crisp cross-ice passes while skating on the perimeter in the offensive zone. He also shows a willingness to go to the front of the net to make himself available for deflections and attempt to screen the opposing goaltender. At both ends of the ice, Chibrikov's compete level is impressive for the most part, keeping his legs churning and playing aggressively on the forecheck in order to make life difficult on opposing defenders on the breakout. But his effort level and intensity can cut in and out, as some shifts he can dominate the play, but others where he blends into the scenery. His defensive game can be quite inconsistent. Though Chibrikov can appear to be engaged with the puck in his own zone and shows a willingness to keep his feet moving, there's something left to be desired in regards to his defensive positioning and awareness. There is a disconnect with his ability to read and react to the play in his own zone, which leads to him running around in his own zone a bit too often and prolonging defensive zone time at times where proper positioning could have potentially broken up passing plays. In addition to inconsistent defensive reads, there are also times where Chibrikov is guilty of flying his own zone too early in an attempt to stretch the ice, making breakouts more difficult for his defensemen."
2021,C,74,185,52,NYI,19,Aatu Raty,"Raty is one of the biggest mysteries I can recall of the last few years watching prospects. He was a go-to player for Finland coming up, as the No. 1 center for a solid U18 age group last season and making Finland's U20 team a year before his draft, while also playing well versus men. He looked like a high-skill playmaking center with good athletic tools. Then this season came and the offense disappeared. Raty's game looked so simple between the junior and Liiga levels and he was cut from the U20 team. Various scouts have varying theories. Some think he lacks speed. Some think he lacks hockey sense. I've seen enough over the years to still believe in the player, but it's fair to say I approach him with a large degree of caution. He has skill in his game. He has quick-twitch hands and is great at handling the puck in small areas. He's a fine, albeit awkward, skater who makes skilled plays on the move but needs to add more pace to his game. His playmaking and shot are both solid quality, but neither are spectacular. He has some physicality to his game and brings energy to shifts. That's the Raty I think is there, and may show up in future years, but he didn't this season. In a sentence, Raty projects as an NHL second-line center after being one of my top-ranked prospects coming into the draft season.","There's a lot to unpack in terms of the how and why of Raty's rollercoaster progression to this point (which I delve into in the story hyperlinked below). A lot of his tools are assets that should serve him well within the North American game if/when he comes over, which helps with some of the challenges of projecting him forward today. He's got a pro frame, quick hands, and a hard wrist shot (though he does tend to rattle a few too many of them off of the boards). His skating continues to be a focus for him as he works to build a little more agility into his power, which is already decent. When he's engaged and active, he can be an effective forechecker who wins back possession and then makes plays off of the wall to the interior. When he's playing with confidence with the puck, he's also got the tools needed to create high-danger attempts for himself. I do worry about his decision-making, though, and there will continue to be ceiling and floor questions if his trajectory doesn't begin to follow a steeper incline sooner rather than later. The parts are there, though, and I expect a big showing at next year's world juniors could help him rebuild some of the confidence he's lost. When he's on his game, he's still fun to watch.","Raty is a menace in the offensive zone. He controls the cycle quite well. If there is a decent amount of traffic in front of Raty, he will opt to make tight turns/pivots to fool his opponents and give himself some more space. When Raty is completing a turn, you can expect his turn radius to be pretty tight. This allows him to dance around his opponent without error.
Aside from his crossovers, when you watch Raty's game tape closely, you will see that he has a bit of a heavy foot. Due to his heavy foot, Raty's speed and edges are not always sound. ","Previously held in higher regard as a prospect, Raty hasn't had the best time of it these past few months. Excluded from Finland's squad for the IIHF world junior championship, he collected only six points in 35 games for Karpat. At his best, Raty is a dynamic presence on the ice, with a strong, heavy shot, and exceptional stickhandling skills.

But while he needs to learn to use his size and strength to greater advantage, the bigger issue might lie with whether he can get his head together after such a disappointing stretch. Still, the 18-year-old forward boasts so much potential.","Aatu Raty entered the year as the prohibitive favourite for the No. 1 overall spot, and what a fall from grace it's been for the Finnish pivot since. The World Juniors would've been a nice opportunity for Raty to correct course, but the Finnish coaching staff had other plans. The good news? Raty's really come on in recent weeks playing against men in the Finnish Liiga. 

Raty's a slick puckhandler, and he couples that with crossover-heavy rush patterns to throw opposing defenders in a blender. His skating needs a fair bit of work. The output is greater than the inputs suggest it should be, but there's no getting around his flared knees and a lack of ankle flexion.","Aatu Raty was the prohibitive favourite for the No. 1 overall spot in the 2021 NHL Entry Draft this time last year. There wasn't even any debate about it two seasons ago; it was Raty, and then everyone else.
It's been all downhill since, and now it wouldn't come as any surprise to our staff to see Raty fall from the ﬁrst round period.
The thing is, Raty just hasn't played all that well. He will have earned every draft spot that goes by before he eventually hears his name called.
You could've guessed that much looking at his Elite Prospects page. Raty scored only six points in 35 Liiga games with Karpat, a drastic fall in points per game output from the four points he amassed in 12 contests just a year prior.
Jeremy Davis' pGPS (prospect Graduation Probabilities System) captures that statistical stagnation aptly. Raty's three-year regressed pGPS XLS% (Expected Likelihood of Success) is 26 percent, but his work in the Liiga this season only carries a 12 percent mark. That three-year regressed XLS% is among the higher outputs in the group, but his draft-year mark is more ﬁtting of a mid-round pick than a top-10 talent.
There's still hope for Raty, and much of it traces back to his shot. He generates so much power on every release by sacriﬁcing a quick drawback, instead taking his sweet time loading downforce into his lever-action wrister. It's a hard, accurate shot when he has the time and space to send it on net. It's not enough to just have an NHL calibre shot, though. The best goal-scorers know how to increase the odds by taking the puck to the sensitive spots in the offensive zone, whether it's driving the centre lane as a puck-carrier or hounding the net-front for loose pucks.
There's no need to tell Raty that twice. He'll drive the centre lane with the puck on nearly every entry, and he isn't shy about setting up shop at the net-front even if it means paying a physical toll on every shift. He's physical, able to play off of contact and absorb shock, and those qualities serve him well just outside of the blue paint. The same is true of his off-the-puck timing; every goal-scorer needs that killer instinct to consistently produce at the NHL level.
The problem is that Raty is a little bit too focused on playing the net-front and driving the centre lane than is perhaps necessary. He always wants to take on opposing defencemen in space -- he suffers from a nasty bit of tunnel vision -- and tends to do so from a glide. He's a crafty handler, but this approach isn't sustainable.
“There were sequences that left me wondering about Raty's adaptability and problem-solving,” Elite Prospects Dir. of European Scouting Lassi Alanen remarked in a September game report. 
“He tried to brute-force his way through the middle a couple of times and simply didn't have the speed to do so when he instead could have gone for a drop pass play or tried to get his linemates involved in other ways.”
Certainly, Raty's propensity to engage opposing defenders in space isn't projectable with his handling base and skating form. He keeps the puck in front of him as a carrier, exposing it to unnecessary risk in space. And he's a heavy skater, with a wide recovery and a lack of ankle ﬂexion in his forward stride.
In a year where so much of Raty's game either plateaued or took a nosedive, we have to spare a little print for his growth as a defensive contributor. His work rate took a turn for the better, and he was a hound for loose puck retrievals. His defensive reads got better, too. The sum of all these parts leaves you with a pretty interesting player. Raty is a north-south, shoot-ﬁrst winger with a shot that barely registers as above-average and poor skating form. The contradictions in his game are obvious, but so too is the talent that once made him a candidate for the top spot in this year's draft.
Recalibrate your expectations, and Raty is still an interesting player from about the middle of the ﬁrst round onward. He could credibly hang in an NHL middle-six at the height of his career, but it's far from a certainty. He needs to bounce back in a big way next season.","Heading into the season, Raty was the consensus number one pick in this draft.  He made the World Junior Championship as a 16-year-old and didn't look out of place. He looked like a sure-fire, play-driving top-six forward. However, his game took a massive dip this past season. Raty failed to make Finland's World Junior team and struggled offensively all season long.  

However, even with a difficult season, there are some strong pieces and tools here. Raty has elite skating ability and hands. In the past and in moments this season, he has shown that he may be able to drive play at the NHL level. When at his best, he is tenacious in the offensive zone and picks up speed with the puck on his stick. He isn't afraid to attack the net and dive into high danger scoring areas to create opportunities.

Raty's biggest question mark is his ceiling. Before this season, it looked like he could be a first-line center with a high offensive ceiling. Now this has come into question. With only six points in Finland this season, Raty may be more of support offensively in the NHL and a middle-six forward instead of a top-six. Consistency was an issue last season, and he struggled with the transition from Finland's junior league to its top league.  

That being said, Raty has the tools to be a top-six forward at the NHL level. His development next season will be huge and will give us a better gauge of his overall ceiling. He is likely two to three years away from NHL duty.","Raty is one of the more interesting prospects in this class. His vision is excellent, finding the lanes very well and processing how the game is evolving around him and reacting. He's a premier playmaker with a big bag of tricks. He can pass effortlessly on his backhand, including no-look and behind his back. His puck control is very good, with hands that are deceptive and fast. He can maneuver the puck through small gaps in sticks and skates, which helps him a lot in 50-50 puck battles. He displays good effort offensively, pushing the pace, forcing turnovers and making a consistent effort to leave his mark. He's not particularly big, but there are some power elements to his game. He's hard to slow down when he gets the puck with a head of steam. He knows how to cut players off, with or without the puck, cutting through player's hands to create space, and protect the puck. His shot can be a weapon at times, but he can revert to a sweeping shot from the perimeter often as well. After gaining the zone at times, he can tend to lose his dynamic posture, resorting to the “A” stance and losing his mobility. Battles very hard for the puck in the corners and along the boards. On one occasion, he wasn't giving his all when defending the rush, coasting on the way back and skating by the open man in front of the net, who shortly after scored, undefended. What really holds him back is his hockey sense. He's a very single-track-minded player, as he'll pick something that he wants to try and then get blinders on about doing it, failing to adjust if necessary or to spot better options. He often tries to force the play he wants, and that makes him easier to defend. Without the puck he doesn't do enough checking over his shoulder or keeping his head on a swivel, which causes him to lose his defensive coverage or skate away from the action at others. His skating mechanics are a little choppy as well, almost like he's stomping around the ice at times. Raty has a bit of trouble turning and changing direction. His movement just isn't smooth overall, forcing him to rely on his leg power and balance instead."
2021,LW,71,170,15,NYR,20,Brennan Othmann,"Othmann went to Switzerland's second-tier pro league without an OHL season, where he was up and down during that stint. At the U18 worlds, he was excellent, though, as one of the better wingers in the tournament, which looked more like his strong underage season. Othmann is a skilled goal-scorer. He has very quick hands to make plays in small areas and beat defenders. He sees the ice well, showing the ability to create offense with his vision. His shot can beat goalies from range and is his main weapon. He competes well enough to win pucks versus men and is quite physical, although he can be a little perimeter. He lacks the ability to separate with his skating, which is his main drawback. In a sentence, Othmann projects as a second-line NHL winger who will be able to score on and irritate opponents.","A year ago, Othmann was good in Flint (good enough to be first-team all-rookie in the OHL) without really living up to his — or most scouts' — expectations. And this year has felt like more of the same. He played well in Switzerland, contributing in a top-nine role in the country's second-tier pro league and helping to turn around a struggling team. He had his moments at U18 worlds, too (including a between-the-legs goal at the crease). But for a player with his offensive gifts, he still often leaves me wanting more. There's legitimate high-end skill to his game, including impressive touch with the puck, a goal scorer's touch in the way he masks his release with his footwork (it's an accurate, deceptive shot more than a hard one), and heady spatial awareness inside the offensive zone.","When it comes to puck control and stick-handling, Othmann has some development to do. Othmann will sometimes struggle to gain possession of the puck off of a pass. He tends to lose control of the puck immediately. This situation tends to arise when Othmann is not being presented with a traditional tape-to-tape feed.
As I mentioned above, Othmann does an excellent job at finding open ice to exploit. It's not just open ice down low in the slot. Othmann has shown that he can find open ice in low danger situations as well. But, he will also go down low when teammates are beyond the red line in low danger and identify spots in high and medium danger for them to thread passes to.
Othmann's skating needs further development.
In the defensive zone, Othmann has shown that he can be an efficient defender. In low danger situations, he will play the body of the puck carrier and looks to exert dominance/upper body strength to force the carrier to lose possession of the puck at the moment of impact.","Fleeing the idle Flint Firebirds (OHL) for second-tier professional pastures in Switzerland, Othmann held his own just fine against fully grown men, scoring seven goals and nine assists in 34 regular-season games. His ability to quickly adjust to the pro game overseas is testament to his maturity and impressive hockey IQ. A near point-per-game showing at the under-18 championship tourney pads what was a relatively successful pandemic-riddled season all around.

Not yet the strongest skater, the winger makes up for that minor shortcoming with a hard, accurate shot and admirable puck-moving abilities. He doesn't shy away from grinding out front of the net and in other dirty areas. The 64 penalty minutes earned with Olten in the Swiss League also speaks to Othmann's willingness to lay it on the line physically.","Brennan Othmann plays a simple, effective brand of hockey. He's a high-pace sniper with a mechanically refined wrist and the knack for getting it off mid-stride. Our staff share some concerns about Othmann's skating stride. He covers enough ground for now, but a wide recovery and inefficiencies elsewhere could prove prohibitive to NHL success. It'd be nice to see Othmann find a little more consistency with his work rate, too.","Brennan Othmann plays with an attacking mindset every time he steps onto the ice. There's no ambiguity in his game.
You put the puck on his stick, and he's full steam ahead. It's just that simple. And you don't want to get in his way if you're an opposing defenceman. He'll run you right over if you get between him and the offensive blue line.
It seems like he's most comfortable in those situations. Othmann loves nothing more than to collect the puck on the breakout, lead the charge into the offensive zone, and turn the corner on opposing defenders. He's almost a little too enthusiastic about those sorts of plays, often ﬂying the zone early to make them happen.
It's easy to understand Othmann's afﬁnity for those rush chances, though. His wrist shot -- one he can ﬁre off in-stride and off of either foot -- is a legitimate weapon. He's not a particularly graceful skater from a mechanical perspective, but he's got enough pop to get by in each of the competitive settings that have been presented to him at this point in his career.
He always attacks at full speed, playing a high-pace style, and pressuring with that same level of intensity. Couple that with the ability to ward off backpressure and strong puck protection mechanics more broadly, and you're looking at the makings of consistent rush threat.
There is some nice diversity to Othmann's game, too. He doesn't need to carry the puck into the offensive zone to be effective. He pressures on the forecheck, plays the body, and takes good routes to cut off the opposition's attempts at a breakout.
“Othmann's life motto has got to be no stats, just vibes (despite the goal and assist performance in this game),” Elite Prospects OHL scout Lauren Kelly remarked in a game report from the U18s. “Othmann was just a menace on the forecheck, putting in the work down low in the offensive zone, and laying big hits whenever he felt he had the chance to.”
Perhaps most promising of all is that we saw some real growth during sustained offensive zone possessions from Othmann at the U18 World Hockey Championships. He evolved from a mostly one-and-done rush threat in the Swiss second-tier men's league to a consistent off-the-puck scoring option, ﬁnding soft-ice with which to wield his shot. It's not like Othmann forgot to play the hits, either. He still scored one of if not the best goal in the entire tournament with a seeing-eye, top-corner wrist shot from just above the goal line on a rush play in preliminary action. He was still an absolute wrecking ball on the forecheck.
We'll need to see Othmann continue to show growth during sustained offensive possessions to conﬁdently project him as much of a scorer at the next level.
As Othmann's skating advantage dissipates at higher levels of hockey, so too will the opportunities to put defenders on their heels or beat them wide for chances. He recovers wide, lacks depth, has an arched posture, and suffers limited ankle ﬂexion. It's going to seriously limit his capacity to create rush offence at the next level.
Likewise, Othmann will need to show a much better commitment to the defensive side of the game. He has the mental makeup and the skills to play a solid 200-foot game, but the inclination hasn't always been there. It's an easy enough ﬁx, and we think he'll eventually sort that out.
We're conﬁdent that Othmann brings enough skill, versatility, and scoring touch to hang in an NHL bottom-six at the height of his career. He'll make life miserable for the opposition and score the odd goal. It ain't much, but it's honest work.","Like many players on this list, Othmann lost a place to play when the OHL fully canceled its season. So, Othmann headed over to Switzerland to play against men. Overall, he didn't look out of place and managed to create some offense and rack up some high penalty-minute totals. He also managed just less than a point-per-game for Canada at the Under-18's.

Othmann is a well-rounded winger who can play up and down a line-up with ease. He plays an agitating style of game and he can drive opponents crazy. He has excellent offensive instincts and awareness. At the Under-18's, Othmann showed some high-level creativity as well. He is especially dangerous when in-tight, close to the net in the offensive zone.  

If there is a question about Othmann's game, it's his ceiling. Due to having to play up against steeper, older competition, some questions surround his offensive ceiling. Some scouts are concerned he may not be more than a support level bottom-six forward. However, his flashes of creativity show he has at the very least second-line scoring ability. His combination of skill and tenacity make him a forward that will likely go in the mid to late first round. Othmann will need two to three years of development before he is NHL ready.

","Othmann is a speedy winger with a full toolbox of offensive skill and burgeoning abilities to make creative and shifty plays in transition. He possesses a great shot, with deceptive power and a quick one-timer that he sets his feet for very well.  He shows off great shot mechanics, pointing his toe towards the net and showing good downward force into his stick. He has the ability to fire shots off both legs, a very transferrable trait with the ability to get shots off from anywhere on the ice quickly. He's a strong puck carrier who displays some fancy moves but keeps it simple with quick puck movement more frequently. Shows good puck control at high speed, including great vision off the rush and fearlessness cutting to the middle of the ice. He makes a habit of surveying his options in the offensive end, excelling at creating quick passing plays and working off the cycle. He possesses really impressive poise and puck protection, taking the time when called for to make an extra move and open up a better passing option. He shows a sound instinct for finding space to release his shot in the offensive end, but should be more aggressive firing pucks on net when given a decent chance rather than waiting for the perfect opportunity. Othmann is an above-average skater who shows good agility and the ability to stop and change directions on a dime, but doesn't get great extension on his stride and it limits his acceleration despite solid foot speed and great conditioning.  Improved lower-body strength would be huge for Othmann, as currently he struggles with his acceleration and he's pushed off the puck a little too easily. He has decent defensive smarts from the wing, with solid body positioning and aggressive pursuit on opposing defenders. He can put forth inconsistent effort on the backcheck but shows a nice active stick and defensive reads when he's locked in. He doesn't initiate physically enough but isn't afraid to support the play in dirty areas of the ice. He can play a very gritty game, making him incredibly difficult to play against, although this will need to be more consistent. Othmann was one of the early movers to play professionally in Europe this year, where he took strides forward in his all-around game."
2021,RW,71,156,14,BUF,21,Isak Rosen,"Rosen hasn't popped yet at the pro level, but as a junior, between the J20 and international level, he looks like a dangerous scorer at wing. Rosen is very creative with his one-on-one play, showing the ability to beat defenders clean with consistency. Rosen has impressive speed and is able to make a lot of his skilled plays through defenders and to teammates while on the move. His game has a lot of pace to it, which should translate to higher levels. Rosen didn't get a shot grade but he shows flashes of an above-average shot. He's OK off the puck, but he doesn't shy from making plays to the net. In a sentence, Rosen projects as a middle-six NHL winger.","Rosén's a slippery goal-scoring winger who just looks talented in possession. On the attack, he's a crafty handler who sneaks through traffic to navigate in and out of space in control, drawing attention as he goes. A lot of the tools he hones are also the ones required of smaller players in today's game. He's inventive. He's a light, fluid skater who changes directions in an instant and beats defenders off of cuts. And his ability as a marksman really can't be overstated. His shot is pinpoint accurate (both his one-timer and especially his wrister) and he makes a ton of quick adjustments before he releases the puck to catch goalies and defenders off guard. Though his mentality is to look to attack the slot to score, he's also got great touch with the puck when play breaks down and he has to improvise or make a play to a linemate. He's going to have to learn to play a little differently to build towards a scoring role at pro levels and there were times this season in the SHL where he looked a little overwhelmed and timid (which differs starkly from what he's like against his peers), but if the right team is willing to be patient with him, the payoff could be worth it.","Relentless two-way play combined with IQ are the foundations, but game-breaking speed and skill are what stand out. Both transition the puck at an elite level, and have the vision and shooting ability to be a real threat in the offensive zone.","While he isn't at all big, Rosén is extraordinarily fast, which serves as the winger's most alluring attribute. He's also an intuitive and creative playmaker with a good shot, but it's his speed that truly sets him apart. A standout at the at the under-18 championship in which he scored seven goals and two assists, Rosén was held to one lone helper in 22 games with his pro team in Sweden this season. It will be interesting to see how he progresses in his second full campaign (he played a single game in 2019-20) in the SHL.",Isak Rosén really started to win our staff over with some of his games in December. There are just so many NHL translateable parts of his game. He's a heady distributor with a great sense for timing and space and blends that skill with some really dazzling flashes as a puckhandler.,"Isak Rosén is pure skill and ﬁnesse personiﬁed. The only real question is whether he's skilled enough to make that work for him at the NHL level.
The last thing you want to see is Rosén in space. He collects most pucks mid-stride. His handling and skating forms are nearly impeccable. He'll send false signals between the blue lines to move the feet of opposing defenders, cutting east-west and using the dotted line. He'll fake weight shifts, shoulder-shimmy, and just overpower hapless defenders.
So you don't just have to contend with Rosén's skill. You also have to contend with the NHL-level habits that act as a force multiplier on his ever manoeuvre.
That's the sort of thing we look for in players with Rosén's proﬁle -- highly skilled, frail, a little undersized. That's the difference between a good junior player and someone with legitimate NHL aspirations in a supporting scoring role. “Another creative winger who can drive play and do numbers,” Elite Prospects Swedish regional scout Jimmy Hamrin wrote in pre-U18 proﬁle. “Rosén had a tough time protecting the puck in the SHL but is highly skilled with strong skating, a strong shot, and elite puck skills.”
The problem is that Rosén struggled to leverage those skills at the SHL level, where he played for Leksands last season. It was just far too easy for opposing defenders to keep Rosén and his 5-foot-11, 161-pound frame to the outside.
To his credit, it wasn't for a lack of trying. He would make every effort to get to the centre lane on the rush or off of the puck in many of our viewings; it's just that he couldn't seem to crack the code.
The same is true of Rosén along the boards, where he was a pushover in puck battles against professional competition. Defencemen overpowered him with a stern look. He could make life easier for himself by keeping his feet moving along the wall and not telegraphing his every step, but I don't suspect either of those ﬁxes will make a substantial difference.
It's really this simple: Rosén needs to bulk up. His meagre build is already limiting him at the SHL level, and it's not going to get any easier for him in the NHL. There's going to be less space, and defenders are going to be even faster and more physical.
Likewise, Rosén already has a sound defensive foundation in place. He's a high-radius defender, covering large swaths of his zone with explosiveness as a skater, agility, and second efforts. He shows up to work defensively, even if he's not physically equipped to leave many of those puck battles with possession. You add a little muscle, and the equation changes.","Unlike his Swedish counterpart, Rosen has the potential for more explosiveness in his game. Yet, there is a significantly higher risk to his overall game. Like Robertsson, Rosen struggled offensively in Sweden's top league. However, he excelled at the Under-18's, averaging a goal-per-game.  

Rosen's biggest strength is his explosive speed. Rosen uses his speed to break away from defenders and cut around the outside of opposing defenders. His speed also gives him space in the neutral zone to make plays. Overall, he has excellent offensive vision and has the ability to make a play dynamically out of nothing. Even though he failed to score in 22 games against men, there was a fearless element to Rosen's game that was evident. Even after making a mistake or turning over the puck, Rosen consistently fights to make up for his errors and regain possession.  

The biggest question mark surrounding Rosen is his strength and offensive consistency. Next year will be huge in determining his potential offensive ceiling. His tools, compete level, and tenacity makes for an intriguing prospect for teams late in the first round of the draft.","Rosen is s a quick and energetic player, able to accelerate in the blink of an eye and burst into open space, despite the fact that he's not the most agile and doesn't get the best extension in his stride. Instead, he gets to where he needs to go due to his reaction time, determination, and understanding of routes than his skating technique. Rosen always moves his feet and has the ability to create space in the offensive zone for himself or his teammates thanks to his skating. What makes Rosen so dangerous, even at the SHL level, is how well he can handle the puck and take advantage of the speed he has to create scoring chances. His overall puck control is good, but not high-end and not the smoothest. He displays an above-average nose for the net, getting himself open in high-danger areas and driving hard to the net. He has a hard and well-aimed shot with a quick and unexpected release. He also shows off a strong one-time shot, getting a great deal of force behind it. He plays with a lot of pace in all three zones, applying the right amount of pressure on the forecheck while also hustling back hard to help out defensively. Rosen thinks the game quickly and plays on high alert, including lots of shoulder checks to keep track of what's going on around him. He has a great, accurate pass and a great vision which makes him hard to defend against. That being said, his pass receptions could be cleaner and more consistent. Rosen also need to improve on his poise, as there are times where he can try to force things and turn the puck over. Especially under pressure, Rosen can rush his decisions, which indicates that his processing will need to improve. His physical play is definitely an area for improvement, as he has a smaller frame and gets muscled off the puck quite easily. He struggles when he is engaged by stronger opponents and he has issues when battling for the puck along the boards at times. Despite getting outmuscled though, Rosen never backs down, consistently jumping into these battles and fighting hard for the puck. He's a highly competitive player with high-end offensive instincts."
2021,C,72,184,42,LAK,22,Francesco Pinelli,"Without an OHL season, Pinelli went to Slovenia and was also one of the top scorers at the U18 worlds, despite limited minutes at times. Pinelli is a highly intelligent player who can make tough plays consistently. He has the small-area skills to make checkers miss and the vision to make plays off the flank and under pressure. He competes well enough to win puck battles even if he's not overly physical. His skating is elusive, with a decent first step and ability to 10-2 around defenders, but he lacks separation speed. His toolkit doesn't scream “first-round pick” and he's listed higher than where my eyes think he should be due to just how much he's shown he can score at various levels. In a sentence, Pinelli projects as a middle-six NHL forward who may frustrate a coach if he doesn't score.","Pinelli's game is archetypal of the way the game is trending. He's a slick, creative puckhandler and facilitator who manipulates set structures to create lanes for himself, slicing pucks through and around feet and sticks. He's also light and airy on his blades, with skating mechanics around quick cuts and adjustable edges more than straight-line power. He's an entertaining, puck-dominant east-west player who thrives when he gets a lot of touches. And while his decision-making with the puck can be a little suspect at times (and resulted in a brief benching during his otherwise impressive U18 worlds), he's diligent without the puck and projects as a centre long-term.","If you like fun and flashy hockey players, you will appreciate Francesco Pinelli. Pinelli has shown throughout his time with the Kitchener Rangers and HDD Jesenice that he can be a dominant force in all three zones. He is a defensively responsible forward with a quality shot in medium danger.","On loan from the Kitchener Rangers to HDD Jesenice in the Slovenian pro league, Pinelli collected 11 points through 13 games in an altogether light competitive season. A more notable tour with Canada's under-18 group resulted in an additional four goals and seven assists in seven contests. A play-driving center and innovative puck-handler, Pinelli thrives in the offensive zone. But he's only a so-so skater who needs to work on his explosiveness and acceleration.

Still, with further development and improvement, the tools and on-ice smarts are in place for Pinelli to serve as a top-six center at the NHL level.","We're sticking our necks out a little bit with Francesco Pinelli, but in a year like this one, why not? Rachel Doerrie, who scouts the OHL for us, gave a rousing endorsement for Pinelli, and that's good enough for me. However one defines hockey sense, Pinelli's got the stuff in spades. He works with a great understanding of timing and spacing in the neutral and offensive zones alike, and always makes the right play with the puck. It sometimes seems as if Pinelli has everything mapped two or three plays ahead of the competition. He needs to play with more pace, but Pinelli has all the trappings of a playmaking centre.","Francesco Pinelli was one of the most difﬁcult evaluations for our group this season, and that's really saying something considering the circumstances of the 2021 NHL Entry Draft.
We started the year with Pinelli at No. 6 overall, placing a bet that his pace would catch up to his well-above-average offensive instincts and tools. That just didn't happen, which changed our calculus.
The Kitchener Rangers product ﬂew from the uncertainty of the OHL for the guarantee of playing time in a professional setting with the Slovenian-based HCC Jesenice of the AlpsHL. His skill level was ever-present, and he used it to amass 11 points in 13 games, but his pace remained sluggish.
“Pinelli was trying to force plays or do it all himself,” Elite Prospects OHL scout Lauren Kelly wrote in a March game report. “His style of play, the habits that worked well in the OHL, haven't seemed to translate overseas -- and I did ﬁnd it odd that his teammates rarely wanted to give him the puck on the power play. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot to like about Pinelli's skill set -- it just seems like there's a bit of a mismatch here.”
So, we had to drop Pinelli pretty drastically in time for the U18 World Hockey Championships.
Pinelli must've noticed. He went to Frisco and Plano, Texas, and played perhaps the best hockey of his budding career. His work rate soared to new heights. He picked up the pace. He even battled through a little bit of adversity, overcoming a third period benching early in the tournament to play a critical role in helping Canada secure the gold medal.
We've more or less split the difference between the two rankings, and that suits us just ﬁne. You just can't drop a player as skilled as Pinelli any further than this. Certainly not in this draft. He's a dual-threat scorer in a class with few prospects who conﬁdently project as much of a singular scoring or shooting threat at the NHL level.
The foundation of Pinelli's potency is his hockey sense. He supports his teammates, takes optimal routes to prepare one or two plays in advance, always ﬁnds soft ice in the offensive zone, and times his movements perfectly into those pockets of space to strike. With a no-drawback push release, he's sending the puck home as a capable one- and two-touch ﬁnisher. A gifted setup man, Pinelli has a wide array of playmaking arrows in his quiver. He'll attract defenders to within his orbit to create space for his linemates, work the give-and-go, and conceal his intentions until the puck ﬂies from his stick. He'll use weight transfers, fakes, freezes -- anything to keep the opposition guessing.
Some of those same qualities make Pinelli a pretty serviceable defensive contributor when 
he wants to put in the work. He tracks well through the neutral zone, makes well-timed interventions in the defensive zone, and takes good lines on loose pucks.
The problem is, Pinelli's effort level comes and goes at his leisure. All of those strong defensive habits don't count for much when he's not loading his stride off the puck and making half-assed attempts at collecting loose pucks or contributing in board battles.
It's not like Pinelli has the physical tool kit to be an overwhelming force in any of those scenarios anyway. He's not particularly strong on his skates and pretty easy to keep at bay along the boards. His rounded posture, and a lack of ankle ﬂexion limit his explosiveness as a skater to such a degree that he's never really going to be the ﬁrst to a loose puck either.
At this point, I hope you understand why we'd keep a player with such dynamic offensive qualities so relatively low on our board. There are quirks to Pinelli's game that could keep him from playing regular NHL minutes period, much less skating in a team's top-six.
He would hardly be the ﬁrst skilled, heady, dual-threat scorer to ﬁnd his prospects of an NHL career undone by a poor work rate and a lack of pace.
You just don't pass on players with Pinelli's offensive bona ﬁdes at this point in the draft, though. Because if everything works out, that's a top-six scoring winger with power play upside.","Pinelli is a bit of a puzzle, but I firmly believe he will be a solid NHL prospect and player. A victim of the canceled OHL season, Pinelli excelled at the Under-18's, putting up 11 points in 7 games, and looked dominant at times playing in Europe this season.

Pinelli is a versatile, offensive forward. He can play all three forward positions and can easily move up and down a line-up. More of a playmaker than a goal-scorer, Pinelli is extremely aware of his time and space in the offensive zone, making him a constant threat. He is an excellent passer and while he isn't a shoot-first player, his shot is also above average for his age.  

Some scouts question whether or not he has an extra gear offensively, or if he will be a perpetual support-type middle-six forward. If all the pieces come together, Pinelli could be a middle-six forward at the NHL with some offensive upside.","Pinelli is an incredibly and dynamic offensively gifted forward. An electric puck possessor, it's nearly impossible to tell what Pinelli is going to do next when the puck is on his stick. Highly deceptive with his use of his edges, twisting and winding through traffic and finding open ice where there seemingly is none. Pinelli also does a good job of keeping his head up and scanning his options while carrying the puck. He can make sharp passes through tight seems and is incredible at finding those passing and skating lanes. Pinelli's edgework and overall skating abilities are fantastic. He's dynamic and deceptive, and he showed an ability to be able to effectively utilize the 10 and 2 skating style to deceive opponents in different areas of the ice. He makes really tight turns and can change direction on a dime. He utilizes weight shifts to move quickly around defenders, bursting with some speed as he adjusts his pace on the fly. The fearlessness he shows is impressive. He constantly tries to push through traffic, sometimes it pays off, other times he puckhandles himself into a turnover. He has no problem bringing the puck into small-spaces, but getting out is a little hit and miss at times. He has a nose for open space in the offensive zone, using quick edges and light feet to quickly drive the net after sliding behind a defender. His hands move so quick with the puck, matching his feet, however he can get stuck with his head down when in a tight spot. He seems to always be looking for the lanes to the net, quite often finding them. He shows his commitment to the defensive side of the puck as well, often the first forward back and getting deep to help his defenders. He'll also hang back when his defender has jumped up in the rush. There are cases where he needs to speed up his processing as he can hold onto the puck for a little longer when trying to evade an attacker. Pinelli often shows a willingness to support pucks low in the defensive zone, but can get caught skating with his stick in the air, limiting his ability to stop and disrupt plays and allowing easy passing lanes around him. Playing in Slovenia, Pinelli had a strong season playing in a professional men's league."
2021,RW,73,177,28,COL,23,Oskar Olausson,"Olausson bounced around between multiple pro levels and Sweden's junior level and mostly had success everywhere he went offensively. He has NHL-caliber speed and skill to go with good size, which can easily let you envision him generating clean zone entries with control. Inside the offensive zone, he's more of a shooter than a passer. He can make good plays and does so with pace, but the main offensive threat he has is his shot and ability to finish from range. Olausson works fine off the puck, he'll get back defensively but he's not overly physical and can play on the perimeter too much. In a sentence, Olausson projects as a middle-six NHL winger due to his speed, skill and shot but may frustrate coaches too.","Olausson's an athletic, fast-in-straight-lines winger with hands like a much smaller player and an NHL wrist shot. He's also a very confident player, so he'll go right through a defender on one sequence and burn them to the perimeter on the next. He was overwhelmingly good against his peers when he played at the junior level this year but I was also impressed with his comfort level on the attack professionally in both the SHL and HockeyAllsvenskan. His ability to hang onto the puck under pressure for a rangier player, or split through traffic to handle underneath sticks really is impressive.","The four S's of scouting are the foundations that virtually every prospect either needs, or needs to have the potential to develop, to one day become a good NHLer. Skating, speed, skill and smarts. Olausson ticks all of those boxes already. And if on a true alliterative bent his shot and strength are also abnormally well developed for his age.
Olausson, as one would imagine with his skill-set, is a serious power-play threat. Not only is he great at helping his team set-up, but once established in his favoured spot on the right boards he is extremely dangerous either walking in for a wrister, or sneaking over towards the circle for a one-timer. Like his skating, his shot technique is a thing of beauty, an efficiency of energy.

So where are the downsides here? While strong for his age he will – naturally – need to fill out his frame more. Also, he will have to utilize his team-mates better and not try as many home-run plays as he progresses. Olausson, however, is very well-rounded for his age.

Defensively he is not what I would call the “instinctive” type. But he plays the game at a high tempo and works hard inside his own half of ice. He is good at turning pucks over and forcing mistakes, and has also proven to be a solid penalty-killer. In his brief SHL career so far he has had some lapses in his own end, and I doubt he will ever be a high-end defensive player, but he will likely never be considered a liability.

Olausson is the type of player that it seems likely NHL scouts will fall in love with. In turn could end up going a lot earlier in the draft than many have pegged him to. If he continues to develop he has the potential to be a 30 goal, first line winger.

Comparison","Olausson moves exceptionally well -- quick and shifty -- for a big guy, and is particularly dangerous at full tilt. His heavy shot, excellent hands, and penchant for finding space adds to what appears to be the full package. Eager to use his body to fend off defenders, Olausson has a good head on his shoulders and anticipates the game well.

The four points collected in 16 SHL games proves he can already produce at a high professional level. No one should be overly surprised if he's selected in the top 20.","Oskar Olausson has speed to burn, and he's using it to put up nice numbers for HV71 in the SHL as a first-time draft-eligible forward. He does a great job of sneaking into soft ice and setting up shop for easy one-time finishes. The World Juniors didn't help Olausson's stock, but I'm not sure it hurt it much either; that was a weird tournament almost across the board for the Swedes. He needs to play with more pace to advance further up our board.","The name of the game for Oskar Olausson is pure skill. He leveraged it across three different levels of competition in Sweden last year to do some serious offensive damage, too.
Olausson's work in the SHL was particularly impressive. He may have only collected four points (three goals and one assist) in his 16 games with HV71's men's team, but that number is so much more impressive than it seems when it's placed in the appropriate context. It's the eighth-most points by a U19 skater in the SHL and in a tie for the ﬁfth-highest points per game rate in that same age group.
You really start to appreciate Olausson's output when Jeremy Davis' pGPS model places that production in the context of players who proﬁled similarly to Olausson to determine his likelihood of NHL success. His 51 percent bXLS% (base Expected Likelihood of Success) and 26 percent iXLS% (impact Likelihood of Success) both check out as top-three numbers among ﬁrst-year draft-eligible forwards in the 2021 NHL Entry Draft.
The ﬁrst thing one has to account for with Olausson is his blistering speed. The HV71 product is one of the draft's best, most mechanically reﬁned skaters, owing to a perfect posture and great depth through each stride. He's an absolute menace with the puck in space.
“It is not just the skating ability -- his perfect form -- but also how he uses that ability, the habits and patterns,” Elite Prospects lead scout  remarked in an early-season game report. “Olausson skates with crossovers most of the time, and he weaves against defenders, changing lanes, weight shifting to fake them out; he can pierce through neutral-zone defenders at this level super easily.”
It may look at times like Olausson is straight-up overpowering defenders, but there's so much more than meets the eye going into every one of those rushes.
He takes that skating foundation and just scaffolds one skill on top of the other on top of it. Olausson's skating posture allows him to effortless manoeuvre through opponents with his top hand in full control, pushed out from his body. You'll rarely see Olausson attempt the same neutral zone rush twice in the same game. He'll cross the dotted line, change lanes and speed, and work well-timed weight shifts as a puck-carrier to get past the defender opposite him.
The data that Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting Mitchell  manually tracked from the World Juniors showed just how effective Olausson is as a puck-carrier. He may have left the tournament without a single point to his credit, but he was one of the more effective transition forwards to wear their country's colours in Edmonton last winter. All of this isn't to say that Olausson is without his warts as a puck-carrier. It's a distinctly positive quality to his game, but it could use a little polishing, too.
The way that Olausson handles the puck exposes it to constant risk; he keeps it well in front of him rather than at his side. He's more of a problem-solver than a planner and often skates directly into pressure or numbers as a result. He's also pretty low pace with the puck.
His proﬁle changes considerably when his team has established sustained possession in the offensive zone. Rather than dominating opponents in space, Olausson takes the puck from the boards and creates in the small area game. He'll draw defenders in, court contact, spin away from pressure, and explode off of the wall for scoring chances.
Every one of Olausson's tools projects as comfortably above NHL average, and that sets an unusually high ﬂoor for a player at this point in the draft. Olausson has the potential to take those individual skills and build them into a top-six scoring winger's proﬁle at the NHL level. At the very least, he comfortably projects to a team's middle-six.","Another Swede likely to be taken in the second half of the first-round, Olausson may be selected before both Robertsson and Rosen. At 6'2, Olausson is the largest of the bunch and is the most physically mature. Olausson played for Sweden at the World Juniors and didn't look out of place.

While there are dynamic elements to Olausson's game, he is still relatively a safe pick for teams. Overall, he is an excellent skater with a well-rounded offensive game. He is okay defensively and has excellent vision in all three zones. Olausson's overall package is highly intriguing, and he could find himself taken anywhere between the middle of the first round to the middle of the second round in this year's draft.

Some scouts would have liked to see more offense from him this season, hence the questions surrounding his upside. While he shows flashes of potential dynamic play, he lacks overall offensive consistency in this area. However, his overall tool kit leads most to believe he will be a middle-six NHL forward.  ","Olausson is a fluid skater with strong puck skills, able to move about the ice with a good deal of elusiveness and carry the puck with relative ease. He's particularly effective while playing in transition, displaying very strong poise and awareness while carrying the puck. This allows him to secure controlled zone entries on a consistent basis. Olausson is a patient puck carrier who is willing to curl back into his own zone in order to maintain possession and has the slick skating ability to turn away from pressure and find open ice. More agile than he is fast, Olausson finds most of his success at creating space for himself while using his edgework to quickly turn away from checkers. He has a nice frame to work with, moves around the ice easily and can create some separation with his higher gears. He's a very potent shooter when he has the puck in a dangerous area. In his own zone, he's often well positioned while away from the puck, but at times was caught puck watching and in turn lost his man in coverage. A concern with Olausson is that he's not a player who leaves a positive impact on a shift-by-shift basis. His awareness and hockey sense can be an issue, as there are some shifts where he loses sight of his defensive check or skates himself into bad places offensively. There are shifts in both ends where he'll make a nice read or a creative play, but they need to happen consistently. There are many times when he skates to where the puck is, not where it's going. Olausson seems to lack spatial awareness, getting caught up in bad traffic and needs to shoulder check more often. He also floats a bit and doesn't show a whole lot of urgency or play consistently with a high pace. The Swedish winger does very little to win pucks from opponents. He doesn't use the power elements to his game nearly as much as he should, and can get pushed around versus stronger opponents. He could stand to be more balanced on his feet. Strength is a regular issue for Olausson, who largely carries the puck on the perimeter and can have a difficult time penetrating the defense down low in the offensive zone. Adding muscle should help this moving forward."
2021,C,68,170,47,DAL,24,Logan Stankoven,"Stankoven has been successful between the WHL and international levels the last two seasons. Stankoven's game has a high level of pace due to his compete. He creates chances by pressuring turnovers and winning puck battles, despite being 5-foot-8. His skating is more elusive than fast and while he's a good skater he doesn't have a great top gear for a small player. He has very quick hands, showing the ability to beat defenders one-on-one, and control pucks in tight at a high level. Stankoven has a great wrist shot and projects to be able to beat NHL goalies from range. He can make some plays, but his game is more direct as opposed to being a cerebral playmaker. In a sentence, Stankoven projects as a middle-six forward, likely on the wing in the NHL.","I had one source describe Stankoven as “superhuman” inside the offensive zone and when you hear that again and again in different ways from different people, and then you watch him fill the net on the ice, the size thing of him being 5-foot-8 begins to dissipate. From the top of the faceoff circles in, Stankoven's a threatening creator who can crack a game open in a split second and who is even more dangerous the closer he gets to the hashmarks. He's got a lethal release, he's strong on his feet for his size, which helps him keep a surprising number of plays alive. He can break down defenders in traffic, he's a sneaky-good facilitator, and he plays with a ton of energy. It's not hard to imagine him building towards a career as a top-six winger in the NHL.","Stankoven's skating is an area of his game where it's solid, but is still being worked on.
Last but not least, let's talk about Stankoven's shot. He has a quick release and will occasionally attempt to dangle with the puck right before he shoots from range.
Stankoven plays a high-tempo game and is a menace in the offensive zone. He rushes towards the puck and plays the puck hard. Stankoven has elite forechecking ability and if his opponent has the puck along the boards in their own zone, he applies pressure to limit open lanes and capture possession of the puck. ","Diminutive stature notwithstanding, Stankoven has the makings of a star at the NHL level. Strong on his skates, the Kamloops Blazer plays much bigger than his 5-foot-8 frame, and doesn't shy away from the rough stuff. At his finest when driving the play, Stankoven scored four goals and four assists at this year's under-18 championship. He's fast, he never stops moving, and he's equipped with a booming shot. It's all there, just in a slightly smaller package.",,"Don't let Logan Stankoven's modest 5-foot-8 frame fool you. He's a scrappy winger, and he doesn't back down. There's no intimidating him out of playing his game.
That reckless playing style earned him fan favourite status for Canada at the U18 World Hockey Championships, and it made him one of the tournament's most effective forwards period. Stankoven seemed to develop instant chemistry with Mason McTavish and Connor Bedard on a top-six matchup line, and they outscored the opposition 8-1 at 5-on-5 as a trio in their time together, according to our partners at InStat Hockey.
You really got a sense for his game watching that tournament. It was the raw, uncut version of Stankoven, driving offence and working his tail off in the defensive zone. You see that play out almost perfectly in the data set that our Dir. of North American Scouting Mitchell  and Dir. of European Scouting Lassi Alanen collected from the U18s. Stankoven is at his best below the hashmarks. It doesn't matter whether it's the offensive or defensive zone -- that's where he's most comfortable.
He's a fearless puck-carrier, always driving the inside, and never shy about setting up shop near the net-front off of the puck. He plays a north-south game and always attacks at an unrelentingly high pace.
The only real problem is that he's not a particularly quick skater; he earned average or slightly above average skating grades from each of our scouts. His posture is far too upright, and he recovers well outside of his frame, resulting in short, inefﬁcient forward strides.
Stankoven makes up for that with a high activity rate in his feet and excellent skating habits, but it's still a pressing concern among our group.
You know how the saying goes: You can be short, and you can be a below-average skater, 
but you can't be both. We're not beholden to that line of thinking, by any means, but there's something to it. It's much more difﬁcult for players with that proﬁle to hang in the NHL.
There are exceptions to every rule, and Stankoven is nothing if not exceptional with the puck on his stick. He's a dual-threat scorer, more sniper than playmaker. Let's start with his shot. , who is our lead WHL regional scout, rates it as one of the standout qualities in the entire draft.
“He showed off an advanced support game, identifying the best position while giving himself an offensive option,”  wrote in a mid-season game report. “Pre-scanned, too. He used his curl-and-drag wrister, which he pulls across his body and ﬁres off his outside edge for a goal and another scoring chance. He sealed off backpressure before ﬁring; showed an ability to shoot through pressure. The mechanics behind his shot are so clean, exerting downward force while pushing his top hand off his body.”","One of my personal favorites on this list, Logan Stankoven had an excellent season in the WHL and at the Under-18's. Listed at only 5'8, Stankoven stands out quickly on the ice for his diminutive stature. Yet, this didn't hold him back as he averaged over a point-per-game at every level he played this season.

A highly intelligent player, Stankoven makes up for his lack of size with his awareness offensively and defensively. He competes at an elite level and doesn't give up on plays or pucks, making him an annoying attacking forward. He draws penalties and frequently wins puck battles against larger opponents. More of a goal-scorer than a playmaker, Stankoven has a quick release and can create offense from anywhere. There are aspects of his game that are Brendan Gallagher-esque, and others that are closer to a Cam Atkinson or Kyle Palmieri.  

Stankoven's biggest question mark is his size. However, it has yet to hold him back and it is unlikely to do so in the near future.  Stankoven projects as a top-six forward at the NHL level. He will need three to four years of development before he is NHL ready.","Stankoven is effective in all three zones, but his best offensive skill is his ability to transition the puck with speed and push the puck deep into the offensive zone. Stankoven also does an incredible job of reading the play and anticipating where the puck is going to be. He attacks space with blistering pace from the moment he steps on the ice and his buzzsaw game-style is noticeable in all three zones. He has an electric shot and generates a ton of torque through his hands. He is also very detailed in his shot placement and has an excellent sense of where the goalie is weakest. While his shot is a major weapon, Stankoven's goal scoring prowess is also aided by his willingness to go to the greasy areas on the ice. His skating abilities are generally a strength however his stride is not picture perfect. He cuts his stride a bit short on the follow through and combined with initial length shortcomings due to his size, he's often at a deficit in efficiency when it comes to a straight-line race. He makes up for this however with scorching foot-speed and a seemingly endless acceleration curve. He is continuously driving his feet and his edgework and balance over his blades is top notch. His ability to reload and shift weight between each quick stride allows him to dart in any direction at the drop of a dime. He uses this to great effect both in creating space along the wall but also in his pursuit of the defender on the forecheck. He is so difficult to shake loose as he can match every stutter, feign, or spin that an opposition puck carrier might throw at him. He is currently a much stronger off-the-puck player, where he can catch and release, than he is carrying the puck for extended durations. There are occasions when he seems to struggle a bit identifying options and he is very quick to dump and chase. He has the abilities with his hands and feet to create the time and space necessary for himself to make a smart play however he currently lacks a consistent commitment to do so. Defensively, he shows a good mix of positioning and aggressiveness however his lack of size is noticeable below the goal line when dealing with the cycle."
2021,C,72,172,21,EDM,25,Xavier Bourgault,"Bourgault is a very skilled forward who has put up huge numbers in the QMJHL the last two seasons with 111 points in 92 games. He scored 20 goals in 29 games in 2020-21. Bourgault stands out with the puck on his stick. He's confident, attempting to make difficult dekes and passes and executing at a solid frequency. At higher levels he projects to play on a power play. He's not an exceptional skater, but he will be able to skate at an NHL level, and has shown he can make skilled plays on the move and play with pace. I wouldn't describe Bourgault as a physical player or the first guy over the boards on the penalty kill, but he backchecks well enough and creates turnovers with his hustle. In a sentence, Bourgault projects as a middle-six NHL forward, likely on the wing.","Due to his October 2002 birthday, Bourgault has the rare advantage of having just completed his third QMJHL season. In the last two of those seasons, he's had an impressive run, with a combined 53 goals and 115 points in 97 regular-season and playoff games. He was Shawinigan's second-most productive player in both of those seasons behind Stars first-round pick Mavrik Bourque. Bourgault's game doesn't leap off the ice at you but he's dangerous in a variety of ways, with a deceptive release that comes off of his blade early in his shooting motion and stance to surprise goalies (off of either foot or from awkward postures, too) and good playmaking instincts inside the offensive zone. He's also an able carrier who adjusts to pressure and plays through contact consistently thanks in part to good core balance over a wide skating stance — a stance which can create a bit of an A-frame and limit his speed, though I'd still qualify him as an above-average skater. He's also a serviceable defensive player — though I wouldn't say it's a focal point of his game — who does a good job staying above pucks and working to win back possession. I like the overall package as a late first-round pick with a legitimate middle-six projection.","When it comes to Bourgault's skating, he is a straight line skater with wide skate placement. His wide skate placement hurts his mobility, but when in full stride, you don't notice his wide skate placement.
Aside from Bourgault's skating, I want to touch on his shot next. Bourgault has solid range on his shot and is a threat in high and medium danger. 
One of Bourgault's weaknesses is his reachability. There are times where he positions the puck way too far in front of him and he can't hold onto the puck.
Bourgault does a tremendous job at finding open ice. 
While Bourgault is outstanding when he is in control of the puck, there are some challenges when he does not possess the puck.","This young man can score. After finding his feet in his rookie campaign, the versatile forward erupted for 53 goals and 58 assists in 92 games with Shawinigan these past two seasons (he was a bit quiet in the playoffs). Exceptionally mobile and adept in tight spaces, Bourgault makes and executes on-ice decisions quickly. Armed with a sneaky-good wrist shot, his passing is crisp and precise. He's also competitive and smart.

Whichever team drafts Bourgault should benefit from his offensive abilities -- perhaps as a third-line center or top-six winger -- for years to come.",,"Xavier Bourgault put up gaudy numbers with the QMJHL's Shawinigan Cataractes this season, scoring 20 goals in 29 games next to Mavrik Bourque, and Olivier Nadeau. Those two took advantage of Bourgault's scoring ability in a big way.
Bourgault can ﬁre off the pass with a variety of short-draw wrist shots to manipulate goalies. He can score by spotting lapses in their coverage from a distance, creating those holes by adding deception to his release -- look-offs and angle changes -- and, near the net, like an expert thief picking a lock, opens up the ﬁve-hole of net-minders with rapid stickhandling motions.
We came to appreciate Bourgault's offensive instincts through the past season. Not unlike Chaz Lucius, the Cataractes forward searches for space in the offensive end. He likes to set up in the high slot and hunt passes coming from below the goal line.
Due to Bourgault's shooter mentality, Bourque and Nadeau were often the ones retrieving pucks and beating opponents 1-on-1 along the boards. Not that Bourgault shies away from such battles, but his puck protection and physical techniques lag behind those of his teammates. His skating form alternates between overly upright and hunched over, which affects his balance and strength in 1-on-1 battles. Bourgault relies mostly on his above-average hands to solve defenders and get out of trafﬁc and he tends to rush some of his plays against back pressure.
“I like the handling, problem-solving skills, and release of Bourgault more than what Zachary Bolduc brings.” our lead scout  wrote in a March game report.
There isn't one big problem with Bourgault's game, but many smaller ones ranging from 
his processing ability to tools. They conspired to drag him down our board as the season progressed.
Our evaluators are split in their evaluation of his playmaking ability. The data points to it being a strong point of his game, but some see issues of translatability in his tunnel vision 
and predictability. We also share concerns about Bourgault's ability to use his main attribute, his release, as often in the NHL. Top scorers manage to ﬁre inside heavy trafﬁc and from compromised body positions, something Bourgault can't do as easily, partly due to his inconsistent skating form. His wavering energy and tendencies to overcommit to attackers and take on them straight on also raise some questions about his defensive capability. Bourgault created among the fewest defensive plays per Corsi against in Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting Mitchell 's data set.
Overall, there wasn't a tonne of progression in Bourgault's game this year, which is fairly concerning considering his late-birthday status. 
In the next few years, we anticipate that he will build enough strength to stabilize his upper-body as he skates, which will improve his wall-play, and that he will leverage his handling skills and the threat of his shot to become a more manipulative playmaker. If both of those things happen, Bourgault could become at least a top-nine NHL winger, one who scores on the power play and off the rush.","This is a strong draft year for the QMJHL (it also helps that they played half a season, unlike the OHL and WHL). Enter another from the league, in Xavier Bourgault. After posting 71 points in the 2019-2020 season, Bourgault put up an excellent 40 points in 29 games.

A creative, playmaking winger, Bourgault is elusive and agile in the offensive zone. He has excellent hands and he maneuvers well with the puck on his stick. Bourgault finds teammates with ease and excels at quick outlet passes to already moving forwards. He is a constant powerplay threat and possesses an above-average shot.  

A question some scouts have is if Bourgault can drive play on his own. His overall play suffered once his higher-skilled teammates left for the World Junior Championship. He may be more of a support-type offensive forward. His defensive game could also use some work. Bourgault is also one of the oldest players in the draft, meaning there are times scouts would have liked to see some more dominant play at times considering this development advantage.

While there are some question marks in his game, Bourgault looks like a solid middle-six forward option for NHL teams in the mid-to-late first round.","Bourgault is a skilled and intelligent attacker who showcases creativity and high-end offensive tools. The winger is an incredible puckhandler with the ability to beat any defender, or even split the defense right through the middle lane. His puck control allows him to play through traffic and escape traps with ease. Adding his tremendous footwork and lateral agility to the mix, Bourgault becomes a highly dangerous threat in tight spaces. He's skilled in puck protection, keeping the puck out of reach with his slick hands and using his body as a shield along the boards. His high-end puck skills can also be seen through his smooth pass reception abilities, which allow for clean, efficient transition. Bourgault is a splendid skater who has developed a liking towards using crossovers to build up speed on the outbreak and attack defenses with different angles and deceptive cuts. His quick feet are evident on these accelerations, but he could add even more power and explosiveness on his inside foot pushes to generate additional speed. Despite the ability to create space for himself, Bourgault is a generous passer, willing and looking to get his teammates involved in the play at all time. He will make the simple pass every time he has the occasion. Bourgault's play without the puck is an indicator of his advanced situational awareness. He's able to be a pass option for teammates where his approach to puck support is less about simply getting open and more about speed and timing. He is regularly able to support his linemates by moving toward the puck carrier to be a high percentage pass option. His play can seem underwhelming at times through his simplicity but he is extremely effective at driving the play up the ice and establishing the offensive cycle. Bourgault can create his own scoring chance in a highlight-reel fashion, but he often trades those riskier solo carries for fluid counterattacks. Bourgault's positioning translates fairly well to the defensive side of the puck as well, though it is a bit more inconsistent in this area and sometimes misses his assignment in hopes of an early zone exit. He needs to learn to adapt to the situation and ensure that he covers up for his teammates when there is a misread on anyone's part."
2021,D,74,192,24,CBJ,26,Corson Ceulemans,"Ceulemans' season was cut short due to the AJHL's pause. He was up and down during that season, but his U18 worlds was promising and his underage profile is encouraging. Ceulemans is a complete defenseman as a 6-foot-2, right-shot blueliner who is mobile, hard to play against and has offensive ability. At the AJHL level, he showed great one-on-one skill and the ability to move the puck. He kills a lot of rushes with his skating and physicality and picks off a lot of passes. At the higher levels of play I've watched him over the years I've questioned if the offense will translate at a top level, particularly the playmaking. But I see enough good things in his puck moving to think he can be a good NHL player. In a sentence, Ceulemans projects as a quality top-four NHL defenseman who could possibly be on a second power-play unit with the potential to play higher in a lineup.","There's a lot to like about Ceulemans' package. He's right-handed. He's big, and sturdy, and athletic and he uses his heaviness to play a rugged style against the rush and in his own zone along the wall (though he can also settle into lackadaisical defensive posture a little too often and get caught puck-watching). He's also capable offensively, with an attacking style which is complemented by a hard point shot (off of his snap shot and his low slap shot) and quick offensive-zone instincts through holes as they open. I do have some reservations about his game, though, including a propensity for mistakes and turnovers and some trouble with his gaps getting caught flatfooted. A strong performance at U18 worlds did help to massage some of those worries because he did a really good job playing within himself while remaining aggressive, but a bet on Ceulemans is a bet on his raw pro tools. If he can put it all together, he'll be a very good pro defenceman.",,"This towering right-handed shot is a staunch defender who also pitches in offensively. Using his size to advantage, Ceulemans is especially tough on opposing forwards along the boards. Perennially eager to join the rush, he skates well and carries the puck out of his own zone with confidence. His shot is widely admired.

In the 14 games divvied up between the Bandits and Canada's under-18 squad, Ceulemans contributed five goals and 14 assists. Destined for the University of Wisconsin in the short term, this 18-year-old is one to watch as a potential NHL power-play quarterback of the future.",,"It's a given: Corson Ceulemans will be drafted much higher than his position on the Elite Prospects ﬁnal ranking for the 2021 NHL Entry Draft.
Unfortunately, we haven't seen enough from the Brooks Bandits defender to match with his top-20 billing in this draft. We thought maybe those would show at the U18s -- that maybe he would come in, raise the level of his game, and ﬁnally live up to his reputation -- but it didn't happen. It was just more of the same from Ceulemans; he continued to raise more questions than he answered.
We see the skill in Ceulemans' game. His tools are imperfect -- he skates hunched over with his rear-end raised and his weight on his toes, and he handles with his top-hand stuck to his hip, limiting his range of motion -- but, even considering the mechanical ﬂaws, his skating and handling could become above NHL average in a few years. And we can't forget his in-stride wrist-shot from the point -- one of the better weapons in the draft, when he gets it through.
And therein lies the problem with Ceulemans's game. The tools are there, but their expression leaves a lot to be desired.
Take his release for example. Too many times, Ceulemans ﬁres it at shin pads. He fails to properly read his gap with defenders, their positioning, and doesn't move when he receives the puck. He catches and ﬁres from the same point on the ice, making it easy for defenders to ﬁnd the shooting lane and block it. 
“Even in the AJHL, he isn't all that effective at the offensive blue-line,” Elite Prospects lead scout  wrote in a November game report. “He shoots at shin pads, doesn't create any separation with the puck because he lacks explosiveness (poor skating stance) and his moves feel pre-planned, as if he is executing drills in a practice”
“He is not reading the defence in front of him and breaking it, but simply trying stuff until something evident opens up (like a perfect seam through the slot). (...). His projection is based on tools, mostly his handling skills. His skating is better than he wants to show. ”
The defenceman rarely thinks ahead on the ice. This ﬂaw was especially evident in transition at the U18s. Due to a lack of scanning before and after getting the puck, his decisions were either slow or rushed. He went glass-and-out when the pressure mounted. These tendencies led him to ﬁnish with one of the lowest controlled zone exits percentage in the entire tournament. His puck-carrying is another element of his game that lacks projectability. Ceulemans can move around defenders by freezing them with handling moves, but his hands will only carry him so far at the next levels. To beat set pro defences, he will need to involve teammates in his rushes a lot more, which means carrying the puck in his hip-pocket, in a pass-ready position, instead of handling it in front, which exposes it to poke-check and forces him into constant dangles to keep it on his stick. 
At the U18 tournament, Ceulemans shined more defensively than offensively, which suggests that, when the competition tightens up, this is the type of game he will play at higher levels. 
His shutdown abilities still need reﬁnement -- better threat identiﬁcation, tighter gaps 
through the neutral zone, more controlled and deceptive poke-checking motions -- but his aggressiveness and physicality are very projectable to the NHL. Ceulemans can pinch, engage opponents, box them out, control them on the boards, and shove them away from the puck. He ﬁnished with one of the better in-zone defence scores in the tournament's tracking data, which was surprising after seeing some of his lapses in the AJHL.
The NCAA competition will do a lot of good to Ceulemans. A more structured game should alleviate some of the issues with his reads and help him develop better on-ice planning. Teammates will be in more predictable positions and that predictability will help his passing game. The extra time in the gym will also help him hone his tools and those give him a lot of different pathways to develop his offensive skills
Still, because of the number of improvements needed for Ceulemans to turn into top-four calibre defencemen, we felt more comfortable having him further down our board. ","Ceulemans is an offensive-minded defenseman, though with a much lower ceiling. Ceulemans has a plethora of raw tools and talent. He is still growing into his frame, and yet he already uses it well. Ceulemans ability to create offense, currently, is more of a result of his raw skill than positioning. Part of this is a result of the league he plays in (lower skill level than others on this list), and his ability to use his overall skill set to his advantage. However, there are questions about how his overall game will translate to a higher league.  

Ceulemans's biggest weakest is his defensive play and awareness. Next year may be a bit of a difficult year for him in an NCAA transition to Wisconsin, as he will be asked to play with more structure and will be relied on less to drive play. When playing against his peers at the Under-18's, Ceulemans excelled, averaging over a point-per-game and showing his game may at least translate quickly on the offensive side of things.

Ceulemans projects as a top-four offensive-minded defender at the NHL level. He will likely need three to four years of development before he is NHL ready.","Ceulemans is a dynamic, deceptive skater who has the ability and creativity to manufacture all sorts of advantageous scenarios with speed and angle changes via pivots or living on his edges. He can make so many subtle adjustments in motion to catch and contain or deliver pucks via the pass to teammates. He can make elite level plays while shifting his weight and when he's carrying the puck, even though he's not a small guy or the fastest player on the ice, he feeds false information consistently with his head, hands and feet which creates hesitation that allows for a new opening to be created. Habitually he's a player who will be a consistent threat to activate or lead the rush and often funnels down middle lanes to get below the tops of the circles where he can either set up a deke or get a quick, hard shot off. In zone offensive scenarios he's consistently rotating and never sticking in one place for long and gains the middle of the ice as soon as possible where he can feed teammates off of his forehand or backhand or shift to play between checks and present himself as a shot option in threatening areas. His skating mechanics are quite translatable to the next level with strong use of his outer edge and positive shin angle which allows superior versatility in terms of his mobility and power generation. He's got great offensive impulses. His skating is a big strength to keeping him matched with opponents and even though he has to work on check attachment, Ceulemans approach to angling, body position and stick detail doused opportunity and allowed him to retain inside position. The biggest issue with Ceulemans is that there is a distinct lack of consistency when it comes to that effort level, especially on the defensive end. He can come off as lazy or reckless with pucks on his stick and limit himself to few options when he's calling his own number to attack, showing an advantage in creative thought processes but limited in his capacity to solve problems. He plays a very aggressive, risky game with his puck rushes, pinches and gap control, so turnovers and offensive breaks against are common. Ceulemans has a ton of raw upside and could easily become one of the very best players from this draft class if his development goes according to plan."
2021,RW,72,190,71,STL,27,Simon Robertsson,"Robertsson impressed at the Swedish junior level before their season was canceled. His pro and U18 worlds had good flashes but not consistency. Robertsson has very good stick skills, is able to deke through checks frequently and create a lot of chances with his skill. He can create off the perimeter with his playmaking, finding seams and making creative passes, but his shot is more dangerous as a legit mid-range weapon to pick corners. Robertsson works off the puck and creates turnovers with his effort. His main flaw for the NHL is the lack of NHL speed and ability to pull away from opponents. In a sentence, Robertsson projects as a bottom-six NHL winger.","Robertsson is a play-driving, versatile winger with a standout wrist shot, who pushes tempo through neutral ice with a compact stride. He makes a lot of smart, aggressive plays inside the offensive zone, and can process the game at speed. When he gets the puck, he's looking to take it at defenders and attack the inside. But there's also variety to his game and when the play to the middle isn't there, he has demonstrated a knack for being unpredictable, so there is a creative flair to his game. Recent viewings (both before and into U18s) did leave me feeling like he was missing the defining skill needed to turn a B-plus prospect you take in the 20s-40s into the A-minus one you'd consider in the teens, though.","So we have a young player with a booming shot, a good two-way game, plus skating and good hockey IQ… but what are the issues?

The main aspect of his game that needs improvement to reach his potential is his decision making when on the puck. He has a tendency to take to much time to make a play
For a player with a seemingly good hockey IQ who both understands seams on ice as well as defensive coverages and opposition goalies it is also slightly concerning that Robertsson often misses clear high-danger passes.","A skilled puck-handler and effective physical presence, Robertsson is most admired for his vicious and accurate shot. Strong on the puck, he doesn't shy away from confrontation in the dirty areas. The imposing winger scored nine goals and 11 assists in 15 games with Skellefteå's junior team, and earned a 22-game run at the pro level. Another round in the SHL will help further season Robertsson's game. His skating could use some refining.","Simon Robertsson has a wide array of shots in his arsenal and isn't shy about pulling the trigger either. They're the weapons around which Robertsson might build an NHL career. He wants to play a high-paced, rush-style of offence, but a propensity to drop his head when pressured could limit how far that takes him at the next level. There's a nice collection of tools here, as Robertsson checks out with average or better tools grades almost across the board.","Our group was optimistic about Simon Robertsson coming into this season, but we left most of our viewings wanting to see more from this Swedish winger. Robertsson is your typical jack-of-all-trades winger. When he was on his game last season, there was a lot to like. He just wasn't on his game all that often. Even so, some distinctly positive qualities revealed themselves in the good and the bad viewings alike.
His shot, in particular, is an NHL-calibre tool that he isn't shy about leveraging against unsuspecting goaltenders. He's got the full array of weapons at his disposal: Snapshots, slap shots, one-timers, wrist shots, one-touch ﬁnishes. It's all there.
He pushes his top hand from his body and fully engages the lever-motion downforce on 
his stick for a mechanically clean shot with plenty of zip and accuracy. It's easily the most projectable tool in his toolbox.
Robertsson couples that shot with savvy off-the-puck timing to make him a consistent scoring threat in the offensive zone. And he's really great at using the threat of his plus-level shot to open up passing options; it's one of those instances where his strength in one area opens up possibilities in another. Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting Mitchell  said it best in a mid-season game report, “he's more dangerous without the puck than with it.”
Whether that's a compliment of Robertsson's play off-the-puck or an indictment of his play without it is the big question. We'd call it a little bit of Column A and a little bit of Column B.
The problem is that Robertsson doesn't really plan many of his touches or register the position of opposition defenders before the puck lands on his stick. If he's not immediately collecting the puck for a shot, then the game starts to move a little too fast for him to keep up, and he's soon out of options and without possession.
It's not necessarily a pace issue so much as a vision one. Robertsson just doesn't seem to catch most opportunities to create through his linemates with give-and-goes or one-touch passes unless they're blatantly obvious or directly in front of him.
“He needs to reﬁne his offensive habits, pre-scanning, his awareness of his space, of defenders, and increase his pace,” Elite Prospects lead scout  wrote in a February game report. “But when he has his options in front of him, he uses them, give-and-gos, cross-ice passes, and changes the point of attack to reposition inside space. He plays more like a scorer than a playmaker, more at ease hunting those openings than creating passing seams.”
Robertsson may not project as a dual-threat scorer, but he's going to ﬁt right into the NHL as a two-way forward. He's probably one of the better defensive wingers in the entire draft.
Our partners at InStat Hockey tracked Robertsson's time with Skellefteå in the SHL last season, and the results were pretty staggering. Robertsson ﬁnished with a minus-seven shot attempt differential at 5-on-5, but he ﬁnished with a plus-18 unblocked shot attempt differential.
The takeaway? Skellefteå may have suffered a slight deﬁcit in overall possession when Robertsson was on the ice, but they didn't give up much in the way of threatening looks.
The hope for whichever team drafts Robertsson is that some of the skills he ﬂashed in his draft-minus-one season will become a permanent facet of his game. You couple that with an NHL-level shot, strong defensive habits, and a high-level work rate, and you're cooking with ﬁre.
The top of an NHL lineup might be out of the question, but Robertsson has all of the tools and gumption to hang in a checking depth role. That seems like the baseline for Robertsson, and anything extra is found money.","Robertsson is an excellent two-way forward who has middle-six NHL potential. An elite skater with a high compete level, Robertsson is constantly aware of his surrounding in all three zones. He plays a simple game that scouts love. There is a low-risk element to his game, which some teams will love. 

He is a player without a ton of flash, but he can play anywhere in the line-up and make those around him better in all situations. There are portions of his game similar to the likes of Mattias Janmark and Calle Jarnkrok, though he is potentially a better skater than both players.

Some scouts have questions surrounding Robertsson's ability to produce offensively at the NHL level. He struggled in Sweden's top league on the offensive side. However, this is an area that will likely come with time and increased opportunity. Robertsson projects as a middle-six forward at the NHL level. He will need a few years of development before he is NHL-ready.
","Robertsson is a big and heavy winger who plays with a lot of power. As a typical power forward, he is not afraid to play physical and get into dirty areas. He is also very strong along the boards and uses his strength and size to protect the puck when carrying it in both acceleration and high speed. Robertsson has a high-end motor and three-zone awareness, helping him to be effective all over the ice and on every shift. He applies tons of pressure on opponents with his pace and focus, and with great routes and positioning, whether that's deep in the offensive zone or high in the defensive zone. He contributes consistently, from stealing and winning pucks to killing penalties. Robertsson handles the puck very well in stride and likes to challenge opponents and he is a threat in every shift when he moves over the offensive blue line. Robertsson has a high hockey-IQ and knows where he has his teammates and when to pass the puck or when to hold on to it. He often makes quick decisions and opens up the game with diagonal passes through the zone. He shows great creativity and offensive awareness in attacking the middle on first touches, which create openings for himself and his teammates. He plays inside the dots on offense and looks for deflections. Robertsson has powerful strides, which helps him reach his impressive top speed. His agility really helps him to change skating directions quickly, which makes him especially hard to defend against when entering offensive zone. He has a fantastic flow in his feet and shows great balance. His shot and his ability to always be around goal scoring opportunities make him a constant threat. He has a quick release, it's very hard and he shoots the puck with accuracy. He can make some dangerous shots and passes, but isn't particularly elite at either. His passes are accurate and hard, without being a trait that truly stands out. He throws his body around from time to time, though he doesn't have the muscle mass to be a physical difference-maker. Robertsson could improve his defensive game by showing more urgency when defending. The Swede is a very well-rounded prospect that will likely be carried to the next level by his competitive nature and ability to contribute in all three zones."
2021,LW,71,196,26,NSH,28,Zachary L'Heureux,"L'Heureux is hard to miss when he's on the ice. He's a little fireball who is full of skill. He is a very imaginative puckhandler, with some of the best hands in the draft who can beat most defenders with his dekes. If he can't get through someone with his skill, he shows no fear to lower his shoulder and barrel towards the net. He's also quite physical off the puck and competes at a high level. For a 5-foot-11 player, he lacks the skating ability you'd like to see to separate from checks. The talent and production is great, but he was suspended several times this season, including for spitting on a player. In a sentence, L'Heureux projects as a middle-six NHL winger who will need to control his aggression.","L'Heureux's a lot to handle. He's difficult to knock off balance. When he leans into his shot (which he does often), it whips off of his stick. When he's ramped up and engaged, he's a pesky, physical, powerful winger who can barrel at, or through, opponents to the middle-third of the ice. He can really impose himself on the game. But I've also seen him play games where he has a negative impact on play. I've been warned by two sources about his attitude — he was suspended this year for spitting on an opponent — and he's got a short temper that puts him in the penalty box too much for my liking. He's going to need to learn to play within himself and stay on the right side of a fine line. And while he possesses a lot of the tools teams look for in “hard to play against” middle-six scorers with skill, buyer beware. He's going to be picked higher than this but I can't seem to wrap my head around some of his actions.","But, let's move away from the statistics and hone in on his playing style. What I love about L'Heureux is his transitional play. In the neutral zone, L'Heureux is constantly finding open lanes and gaps that he can exploit. He will find open lanes to provide his teammates with a low trafficked avenue to pass the puck through. Given how dangerous L'Heureux is at driving to the net and pilling up high danger scoring chances, his transitional play allows him to start his magic from the blueline.

From a defensive and forechecking perspective, L'Heureux's game has evolved quite a bit from his midget and bantam days.
When it comes to his hands, L'Heureux is an efficient stickhandler, especially when he is driving to the net. 
In the offensive zone, L'Heureux thrives in the low slot/doorstep. Most of his primary assists and goals come down low. 
The only other attribute that needs further development is his puck control. 
While L'Heureux has some attributes that needs to be ironed out, I want to talk about how lethal his wrist shot is. He has solid range with his wrist shot and will use it quite a bit in the mid to high slot. ","Four suspensions in a condensed season is four too many. Tempestuous, nonsensical behaviour aside though, the talent is there. Strong on the puck, L'Heureux is an aggressive handful with a great shot. The versatile forward is also an excellent passer and agitating presence with a gift for getting under an opponent's skin. If L'Heureux can figure out how to keep himself in check, some NHL team will benefit from getting one of the better power forwards available in this draft.","Zachary L'Heureux may not have top-six skill, but the path to a full-time role on an NHL checking line seems pretty straight forward. He's violent, mean, and sometimes struggles to walk the line as an agitator, but there's also some nice skill in his game.","Zachary L'Heureux has a mean streak that's already NHL calibre, and he has some skill to go alongside it. That's going to make him a hot commodity at the 2021 NHL Entry Draft.
The question for most scouts is whether L'Heureux is skilled enough to play the part of a power forward or if he'll take on more of a grinder's role at the professional level. The NHL has a lot of time for either player type, but they can't help themselves with the former.
So much of L'Heureux's game is deﬁned by his physicality. He's an enthusiastic hitter, one who's put more than his fair share of poor opponents into the boards or onto their asses. He'll get under his opponent's skin after the whistles. He'll ﬁght. He'll mix it up.
To borrow a line from one of my scout friends, he's the type of player who makes your lizard brain happy.
Sometimes, though, he steps over the line. The physicality that makes him such an unwieldy force becomes a hindrance that puts his team in bad spots. You can see that just by gleaning his 47 penalty minutes, good for the ﬁfth-most in the ‘Q last season and third-most on a per-game basis. The QMJHL website has him down for four (4!) suspensions in last year's shortened season, including one served for spitting on an opponent.
The obvious challenge for L'Heureux is to walk the line a little bit better without taking too much off of his fastball. That's easier said than done, and some players never ﬁgure it out, but that's the task ahead.
The thing is, L'Heureux doesn't need to maim his opponents to be effective. He's got plenty to offer with the rest of his game to generate value.
He plays at pace, takes the inside lane, and drives the net with the puck. If his skating stride was a little bit cleaner, we might even be able to conﬁdently project his rush offence to the next level.
“His skating is absolutely a problem, from his lack of depth to wide stride recovery,” Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting Mitchell  wrote in an October game report. 
“Sometimes, he's not bending his knees at all. A failure to extend his strides (almost zero toe-snap) results in a huge waste of energy.” We've no suh doubts about L'Heureux's playmaking. He's a decent puck-handler, with a decent shot that he can get off in stride, but his playmaking is on an entirely different level. He knows his options, shows the patience to let lanes open, changes angles to create other passing lanes, and shows some real creativity as a distributor in pressure situations. His problem-solving ability through secondary and tertiary defensive variables lets him make plays where others would struggle to retain possession.
Granted, L'Heureux's lack of planning often puts him in positions where he has to problem-solve his way through trouble. His inability to separate from opponents and a lack of outside edge use to manoeuvre away from crunchy spots turn what should be a luxury skill into a necessity on almost a shift-to-shift basis. The same is true of his inability to alternate through different rush patterns and the absence of an east-west game in space. He's just plain predictable with the puck sometimes.
There's also the unfortunate fact that L'Heureux, perhaps ﬁttingly, picked up a lot of his points by bullying the Cape Breton Eagles (one of the ‘Q's weaker teams), and struggled to score against the Charlottetown Islanders (one of the ‘Q's stronger teams).
You take with the good with the bad and even the uncertainty of it all with L'Heureux. That's just the nature of his game. It might be enough to send him to the NHL in a middle-six scoring role with some upside in both phases of special teams.","L'Heureux wasn't released for the Under-18's, which was probably a detriment for what has been a somewhat up and down season for the center. However, he still managed to put up well over a point-per-game in the QMJHL. L'Heureux will be a hot commodity heading into the 2021 draft due to his combination of grit, tenacity, and skill. There's a mean streak to his game, which has also gotten him in trouble a few times this season. However, when he is playing under control, L'Heureux is an absolute handful in the offensive zone.

Though not overly large, L'Heureux is incredibly strong. He protects the puck well and excels down-low in the cycle game. He crashes the net with regularity and loves to mix it up with opposing defenders. As the NHL continues to transition to more of a skill-based game, players like L'Heureux are highly sought after because of what they can bring to the table overall.  

That being said, L'Heuruex will need to learn how to better control the tenacious part of his game. His skating could also use some work and he could be more consistent offensively. Whoever drafts L'Heureux is getting a bit of a project, but he has top-six forward potential. He is a few years away from NHL duty.","L'Heureux is a hard-hitting power forward who uses his incredible strength and tremendous puck protection to work the puck through dirty areas. His impressive physical presence allows him to dominate corners, winning a good portion of his puck battles and making opponents pay with heavy checks. His great balance and core-strength makes him extremely tough to knock off the puck, which is, in part, why he's able to control the disc in traffic so effortlessly. The prospect owns some outstanding goalscoring abilities as well. His wrist shot release is quick and his great power forces swift adjustment from goaltenders. He also displayed great finishing instincts to get into dangerous areas and find the puck with excellent stick-work. His playmaking can be inconsistent, as he shows great vision at times, but does not always have great accuracy, especially on his backhand. He's sound and smart in possession of the puck and will often have his head up to read plays. L'Heureux has a wonderful skating form, as he perfectly leans over to generate more power, extends his leg fully, and makes big push on each stride. The same can be said about his crossovers, where he makes tremendous pushes with his inside leg, allowing him to gain more speed. However, he lacks explosion and consistency in his skating. His first few steps can be particularly slow, which creates difficulties in separating himself from opponents in foot races and prevent him from arriving first on loose pucks. He rarely uses his full-skating abilities too and only does so when he's got an open lane to the offensive zone with the puck. L'Heureux seems disinterested to put effort on the backcheck or in his own zone at times, frequently gliding back without much intentions other than watch the play develop. Finally, L'Heureux physical presence and grit, while a strength in some cases, has raised concerns this season. He was suspended four times this season, bringing his discipline up as cause for concern. There are times where he makes reckless and dangerous decisions on the ice. If he can reign this in moving forward and utilize the sandpaper-style of gameplay into a positive, he could develop into a star player at the next level."
2021,RW,71,189,23,FLA,29,Mackie Samoskevich,"Samoskevich had a good season in the USHL. Slightly more was expected of him coming into the year, but he still was one of the more dangerous forwards in the league offensively. Samoskevich is a talented offensive player who stands out when he has the puck on his stick. He's very skilled, showing the ability to beat opponents often with his stick skills and can do so on the move. He skates well enough to play at higher levels. Samoskevich can create offense with his skill, but also makes plays to his teammates very well and has a shot that can finish from mid-range. He's an undersized player who is just OK off the puck and physically. In a sentence, Samoskevich projects as an NHL bottom-six forward.","A year ago, after the Chicago Steel's record-breaking 2019-20 season was abruptly ended by the COVID-19 pandemic, the team's general manager, Ryan Hardy, told me Samoskevich — who was only his team's eighth-leading scorer — was his most purely-gifted player. This year, in a more prominent role, Samoskevich's season was marked by some highs and lows as he tried to put it all together and take over. His ability with the puck and the speed with which he's able to execute both rank among the very best in this draft. His feet and hands can both keep up with one another, turning defenders on their heels (and sometimes inside out). There's a genius to his game that allows him to see plays through layers that others don't, and then he's got the finesse needed to feather saucer passes off of his forehand and backhand and execute them. I love the way he moves inside the offensive zone and the high tempo he plays with. And while he's not a big player, I wouldn't categorize him as small or weak, with decent strength through the base of his stride that allows him to keep sequences alive. I'd like to see him look to attack underneath to the inside a little more and his numbers don't pop as much as his skill level does, but he's still a first-round talent. Samoskevich will join Michigan in the fall.","Samoskevich is an offensive minded forward who can certainly rack up the points, all while making his game a spectacular sight to see. He's been on Chicago's top two lines for pretty much the entire 2020/21 season, usually paired up with Matthew Coronato and Erik Middendorf. When those three are on the ice, it's practically an offensive clinic for fans to watch.

Samoskevich is amazingly patient with the puck on his stick, and can wait out almost any defender or goaltender in the USHL. Aside from his patience, he also has one wicked wrist shot, which he can utilize from pretty much anywhere in the offensive zone. He's played mainly on the right wing since returning from injury in late February, but he's scored pretty much all his goals from the left-side slot.

As Samoskevich is mainly utilized in the offensive zone (48% of game action), he isn't used much in defensive zone setups or on the penalty kill. However, he is more than capable of being relied upon in his own zone. Samoskevich has such poise picking out a teammate for a breakout pass, or can simply turn on the jets and create a scoring opportunity off the rush.","This skilled speedster averaged more than a point per game for the Steel when healthy this season, and another 10 points in eight playoff contests. A member of the Samoskevich hockey family -- siblings Madison and Melissa are forces in the game -- the future Michigan Wolverine is admired for his creative use of the ice and great anticipation, thinking a step or two ahead of the play. He sets up teammates with regularity and can score himself.

One of the more gifted skaters available, Samoskevich remains a threat to squeak into the top-20 come draft day. At this stage, an absence of grit serves as a minor turnoff.",,"Mackie Samoskevich is an offensive buzzsaw, cutting through opposing defenders and stringing together highlight-reel plays with relative ease. You don't want to miss Samoskevich when he's feeling it.
You give Samoskevich the puck in space, and he makes everything look effortless. He'll blend pass receptions into highly creative dangles around defenders, with top-hand control of his stick pushed out from his body, and quick-twitch wrists to string it all together. He's agile enough to chain together and combine moves and dextrous enough to repair handling mistakes.
He manages space exceptionally well, constantly scanning for the positions of his teammates and opponents alike. And he uses that mental map of the ice to plan his every manoeuvre one or two plays ahead of the competition.
So many of his best plays start in the neutral zone. Samoskevich shouldered much of the transition burden for the Steel regardless of the line on which he played. Even if the skating base isn't quite there, he manages to get by just ﬁne with his advanced habits. He uses linear and non-linear crossovers to accelerate between the blue lines, changes of tempos and speeds, hesitations, and a wide array of rush patterns to create space.
Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting Mitchell  tracked a wide sample of USHL and CHL games from the 2020-21 season, and Samoskevich created more controlled zone entries at 5-on-5 than any other player in that sample.
Just imagine what Samoskevich could do with a cleaner skating stride. His posture is poor, hunched right over, leaving him top-heavy, pressing against the centre of his mass rather than engaging his core through each stride. There isn't any ankle ﬂexion, and his upper body is wholly unrestrained at points.
He's hardly crawling out there. Many of his skating habits cover ground where his stride is otherwise inefﬁcient and limiting. It's still only about an NHL average tool, though. And it's a tool that is vitally important to his offensive approach. There are tools in his toolkit, though. Samoskevich's knack for ﬁnding soft-ice off the puck coupled with his top-ﬂight puck skills make for a pretty lethal combination in-tight. If his teammates can get him the puck, then Samoskevich is going to do damage.
He's also a pretty crafty playmaker. He carefully plans his passes, creating passing lanes with subtle movements and acts of deception. There's also his touch as a playmaker; Mackie, as he's known by his teammates, always puts the right weight on his passes for the right situations.
Just don't expect much board work from Samoskevich. Frankly, he's a bit of a pushover. His feet stop moving and most USHL defenders can shove him off the puck with a stern look. It's not like he's much more sturdy off of the wall, but it's a real issue along the boards.
“The same weaknesses were there,” our lead scout  said of Samoskevich in a March game report. “Balance and anything that resembles close-quarter hockey on the boards. He simply can't protect the puck along the walls against backpressure -- too weak, too unstable, and not elusive enough.”
The same principle applies in the defensive zone. Samoskevich isn't a particularly high work rate player in the defensive zone to begin with. It's not like it would make much of a difference if he showed up anyway. He just isn't strong enough to separate anyone from the puck, short of with a poke-check.
His development path is pretty straightforward. He'll need to bulk up -- that's the starting point. You put a bit of muscle on Samoskevich, and one has to imagine that his wall play takes a big step in the right direction. He'll need to integrate some give-and-go offence to complement his possession game.
Those are pretty minor obstacles for a player in Samoskevich who has the potential to hang as a low-end top-six scoring winger. He's committed to the University of Michigan for the 2021-22 season.","Another Chicago Steal gem, Samoskovich may have a higher ceiling than his teammate Matthew Coronato. However, there are still some overall significant strides that need to be taken for him to be in that category, though there is a rather small margin between them.  

Samoskevich is a player that creates space well for his teammates. His overall high-end offensive skill, including elite hands, allow for him to drive offense and maintain offensive zone possession. He has above-average speed and there is the potential for there to be a dynamic element to his game. Samoskevich showed this in flashes last season and will be given loads of opportunities at Michigan next season.

Samoskevich's biggest area of improvement is consistency, both in his offense and from game to game. There are games when he shows “flashes” of high-end skill, but is otherwise quiet. At other times, he could have a quiet game or two in a row as well. He averaged a point-per-game at the USHL, significantly less than some of his other teammates who are considered to potentially have higher skill than. However, scouts aren't overly concerned and believe positive consistency will come with continued age and maturity.

Overall, Samoskevich only has room to grow and whatever team drafts him will need to give him the time and space. He will need a good three years of development before he is NHL ready. Samoskevich projects as a potential top-six forward at the NHL level.

","While a smaller player, Samoskevich plays a big game. He excels in the offensive zone, reading the play well and driving the net with or without the puck. His offensive awareness is excellent, knowing how to find the open ice and finding the lanes to the net. He's fearless in his drives to the net and in jumping into puck battles. With the puck in the offensive zone, his best trait might be his playmaking. He does this with a mixture of good puck movement, a level of deception, and that awareness of where everyone is on the ice. He does have a good shot as well, although he doesn't utilize this as much. He has a quick release that can fool netminders. His skating is very good, showing fast and explosive movement with the puck through the neutral zone. He also has strong edges, utilizing them to create separation from opponents. His hands are so quick and strong, he can weave in and out of traffic without missing a beat. He positions the puck well in his hip pocket and knows how to best position it away from opponents. He has the hockey sense and poise with the puck to hold onto it a bit longer to allow the opposition to break down and allow lanes to open up. He plays with a great deal of composure and determination, while maintaining a high-tempo pace. Samoskevich is extremely dangerous in all situations, with the ability to play on both special teams. In the defensive zone, he has the ability and awareness to pick off passes, get in lanes, and disrupt plays. He can have shifts that are very strong in his own end, tying up opponents, battling hard, boxing players out, and regularly being in the right place. At the same time, he has a tendency to leave the zone early at even strength, looking to create offense. This can get him caught at times, leaving his team shorthanded in their own zone. Samoskevich's biggest area of opportunity is to continue to build strength. He has the intelligence and skill to be a contributing player at the next level, adding more strength will be an important piece of the puzzle for him."
2021,C,73,175,17,STL,30,Zachary Bolduc,"Bolduc's numbers were good (29 points in 27 games), not as great as expected but he got better as the season went on to build off his strong underage season. Bolduc is a talented forward who has a lot of elements that will translate to the pro game. He can skate well and make highly skilled plays on the move. Bolduc has very good hand-eye coordination, showing the ability to make unique plays in small areas and around the net. He doesn't have the hard, long-range shot, but Bolduc has shown he can score goals and do so by capitalizing on his chances in the slot and net areas. He can see the ice well enough, making creative plays and moving the puck where he needs to even if that's not his top asset. His compete is good enough. Bolduc won't run guys over or be your top competitor but he wins enough battles. In a sentence, Bolduc projects as a middle-six forward, at either center or the wing in the NHL.","After thriving on a stacked Rimouski team a year ago, where he scored 30 goals and won the QMJHL's rookie of the year award, Bolduc faced completely different circumstances this year on a rebuilding Rimouski team that won just 13 of 39 games. From an evaluation standpoint, I actually find it helps to see a player in both of those situations. This year, as the team's primary offensive creator, Bolduc had to make things happen for himself — and did so successfully. A year ago, there were more cookies but he also showcased his ability to play off of his linemates as more of a give-and-go shooter than an individual creator. Both of those experiences have made him a better hockey player and should serve him well into next season with the Québec Remparts, who've acquired him via trade. Mix in an appendectomy, which caused him to miss a month of hockey during a pivotal development period, and there's a lot to consider with how Bolduc's career has played out to this point before you even get to the skill set. As far as the skill set goes, though, I think Bolduc has been a little miscast as a scorer. He's confident attacking off the flank to the slot, and he gets his wrister off in a hurry (though it's not overpowering), but I think he sees the ice at an advanced level and plays with good speed as well. Without the puck, he's also a responsible, no-cheat player who understands his role within a system. He has also played all three forward positions in his young career. I expect he'll be picked in the first round. My only reservation in ranking him there is about his ceiling, which I think tops out as a second-line player if all goes well.","In general, Bolduc has proven to be a threat in the offensive zone and in transition when moving the puck into the offensive zone. If he can work on shot selection, puck security and adopting a power stride, you are looking at a prospect fully capable of being a second/third line asset in the NHL.","Most at home in the offensive zone, Bolduc likes to shoot the puck a lot. An above-average stickhandler, he has good hockey sense, particularly on offense. But while he skates well, Bolduc is prone to coast at times, and needs to bring more grit to his game. Putting forth an inconsistent effort is another concern. After scoring 52 points in his 55-game rookie campaign, 2020-21 was an injury-shortened letdown. Still, there's a lot of raw upside to the young talent from Trois-Rivieres.",,"Our staff was left wanting so much more from Zachary Bolduc this season. It wasn't that he lacked tools. Bolduc is well-equipped to put up points. It's that we didn't see the tactics and habits necessary to leverage these tools for dominant NHL skills.
Bolduc's skating form is far from textbook perfect -- he hunches over slightly -- but it's among the better strides in the class. His knees bend to 90 degrees, advance over his toes, and his hips tilt forward. His form stays relatively consistent as he changes from manoeuvre to manoeuvre. He also shows similarly strong handling and shooting techniques; hands pushed out from his body, ready to launch a shot or a pass at any moment.
Bolduc's tools give him the upper hand in downhill battles. When defenders stand ﬂatfooted or rush him, he dangles through them with rapid stickhandling motions. And when given an open shooting lane, he can take a couple of steps, kick a leg back, and sling pucks past the goalie. But the Rimouski forward generally lacked answers to structured defensive pressure this season. His feet and hands seldom worked together to take on defenders 1-on-1 or escape them; he attacked the opposition's formation in glides, tried to pierce through it on hand-speed alone, and rarely deceived or manipulated to create passing or shooting lanes.
Part of Bolduc's decision-making problems seems to stem from a lack of awareness or infrequent scanning of the ice. This can be encouraging, as shoulder checking habits are easier to ﬁx than deﬁcient reads -- although there are moments this season where we did question Bolduc's ability to use the information he gathers. 
“With his options under him, and the developing play easy to read, clear, he can use the right techniques to reach teammates, slip and hook passes,” Elite Prospects lead scout  wrote in a mid-season game report. “But when he has his back turned, the play usually dies 
on his stick. It seems like an awareness issue or a lack of understanding of how to manipulate defenders to get out of tight situations. He resorts to a lot of blind passes.” Many of Bolduc's tendencies -- as well as the contrast between his shooting and passing metrics -- suggest that he is more of an off-puck threat, more of a complementary goal-scorer than a driver or primary puck carrier -- what he was tasked to be in a Rimouski team that was devoid of offensive talent before the arrival of Xavier Cormier. Next season, players like Theo Rochette and Viljami Marjala in Québec could complement Bolduc quite well -- if the forward does indeed land in that spot. 
With improvements in his awareness, offensive pace, and tactical play, Bolduc could potentially reach a middle-six role in the NHL, but we would sooner bet on other players from the ‘Q' like Zach Dean and Zachary L'Heureux, who, despite also lacking support at times, seem to solve defensive pressure much better. ","A player that has been up and down my list all season, Bolduc had a pretty decent offensive season in a shortened QMJHL season.  However, even after averaging over a point-per-game, there seems to be another offensive level to Bolduc's game that has yet to be seen.

At 6'1, Bolduc possesses decent size and uses it to his advantage. He protects the puck well and has an excellent shot. His release is quick and he is willing to shoot from anywhere. Bolduc also never gives up on a play or shift. In moments of offensive frustration last season, Bolduc leaned into playing a well-rounded two-way game. This mindset will go a long way as a pro and insuring he stays in a line-up, even if he isn't producing.

Some scouts are concerned Bolduc's game is missing a dynamic factor, though he is unlikely to be a big-time NHL scorer based upon his skillset. Bolduc needs to work on his overall offensive consistency and work on developing some explosiveness to some portions of his offensive game if he is to be a threat at the NHL level.

However, thanks to his compete level, shot, and size, he looks like a potential middle-six NHL forward.","Bolduc can really dictate the pace of the play and dissect defenses thanks to his incredible hockey mind. This all starts with his tremendous poise, which allows him to see plays develop with confidence and keeps his cool in pressured situations. He never seems to be in a rush and maintains fluidity despite facing pressure. In spite of his reputation as a sniper, Bolduc loves to break down defenses to find ways to setup teammates. In odd man situations, he enjoys getting creative and stays patient for that passing lane to open up. Overall however, his offensive tools are still raw and fairly clunky. Bolduc doesn't possess highlight reel puck skills, but he does show an ability to get on pucks quickly. In his skating, his stance is excellent, perfectly leaned over to generate speed, and his arms are more focused on north-south movement rather than creating havoc with east-west motion. He makes big, powerful pushes on his strides, but does take a bit more time to pass from his outside to inside edge. This means that between each stride, there's a few milliseconds lost before he can propel himself, which could be fixed with a slightly wider stride. Bolduc still shows above average top-end speed overall. He possesses a great presence of mind to read and process developing plays as a defender. He'll often get on the backcheck to neutralize what could have been odd man rushes and keeps splendid positioning in his own zone. Bolduc owns a fantastic skillset as well to battle off in corner plays. He uses his skates, stick and upper-body strength to his advantage, outsmarting stronger opponents. His play along the boards leads to considerable puck battle wins and defensive recovery for him or his partners. In addition, he displays an outstanding compete level on the puck pursuit. He can be pretty relentless on the puck hunt, shadowing the puck carrier with constant stick-lift and bumps. The main thing Bolduc will need to work on, is consistency throughout the game. He can sometimes become very passive at the end of shifts, gliding without much intentions. He might be trying to pace himself, since he does play big minutes, but if he could keep his high tempo all game, we're looking at a constant offensive and defensive dynamo."
2021,RW,72,175,66,ANA,31,Sasha Pastujov,"Pastujov has been a very productive player with the U.S. NTDP for the last two seasons. He stands out with the puck on his stick because of his very quick hands, great vision and ability to finish plays. He scores wherever he goes and shows the ability to run a power play at a high level. The concern with Pastujov is whether his game translates to the NHL at a high level given he's not a great skater. There are times he looks sleepy on the ice due to the skating and subpar compete level. In a sentence, Pastujov projects as a middle-six winger who will be a big part of a power play but may have issues driving at even strength in the NHL.","I think Pastujov's a little misunderstood. Some scouts see mediocre acceleration and top speed and worry about his ceiling. I see an inventive playmaker who can do a lot with the puck and produced at an extremely high rate as the program's most dangerous offensive player when Lucius was out. He's got excellent touch, regularly pulling pucks through feet and sticks and into space. But he also mixes in fakes and stutter-steps to create transition separation or go inside-out on defenders. You seldom see players who did what Pastujov did this year run into any trouble becoming top college players. He can run a power play, he's dangerous around the net because of his ability in tight spaces, and he's a superb passer through bodies who can slow the play down and dictate with his poise or speed it up with his ability to quickly react to openings in coverage.","Pastujov is an elite passer of the puck, and is a driving force in the offensive zone. He plays with a glowing sense of confidence, and has given coaches/scouts many highlight reel goals during his time at the USNTDP. Aside from his talented skills in the offensive zone, Pastjuov possesses a ridiculously high hockey IQ. The way he can pick out a teammate streaking down towards the slot and deliver a crisp pass on the tape from the opposite circle is mind-blowing.","A smart, creative competitor, Pastujov puts up points with relative ease. Heralded for his playmaking and passing abilities, the winger scored 30 goals and 35 assists in 41 games for his under-18 squad, and registered another eight points in five contests at the under-18 championship. If not for his skating speed and comparative lack of explosiveness -- considered his weakest asset -- Pastujov would be considered a top-20 draft prospect by most in the scouting community. He attacks the game with relentless energy.","There's no such thing as an industry-standard in a year like this one, but even in that context, the range of opinions on Sasha Pastujov runs the gambit. That was certainly the case in our meetings, too. Pastujov doesn't play with pace, and his skating stride is some kind of ugly, but his off-the-puck offence, plus shot, and technical passing skills are all high-end tools.","If the game of hockey was played like its table version, if players could only move in short corridors and were limited to passing and shooting to score, Sasha Pastujov would reign supreme. Not only would this structure level the playing ﬁeld for him -- everyone would have to play his short-range game -- but his abilities would shine even more. No more puck transportation; only slip passes and one-timers.
Unfortunately for Pastujov, the game won't evolve to suit his style. It will have to be the other way around.
To compete in the fast-paced, rush-heavy, and defensively demanding professional circuit, Pastujov's motor will need a serious upgrade. Its three current gears slow, glide, and park will leave him behind the play. Adding a couple of extra speeds would enable Pastujov to catch up and make use of his multiple skills at the next level -- as he has many. The winger's small area play, the way he uses his body to keep defenders away from the puck and stickhandles through opposing sticks along the walls projects well to the next levels. And so does his passing ability, his quick deceptive feeds under pressure to advance the play. There is also his shot, his best ability by far. He can ﬁre off passes, good and bad ones, off either foot, in different ways, wristers, snaps, and one-timers, and do so very quickly by dropping his weight on his stick to activate the ﬂex mechanic and spring the puck on net. 
He can also set up that above-average with clever choices of routes.
As one would expect, Pastujov loves to trail the play. He lets it develop in front of him, picks his spot, and then slides into the area to strike on an incoming pass.
“Solid with his body in-tight, establishing distance and controlling contact to create a bit of breathing room,” Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting Mitchell  wrote in 
a February report. “There's some creativity, too. But there's so much standing around doing nothing. He's not even trying to support the play or get open around the slot. He's there, relaxing. He missed opportunities to use his teammates, and missed opportunities to allow his teammates to use him.” Pastujov can solve the opposition in multiple different ways. He just can't do it with his skating. He leaves most if not all puck carrying duties to his teammate, partly due to his off-puck shooter identity, but more so because he lacks the speed to push back defenders and create zone entries. His slow stride rate, poor propulsion mechanics, and low energy reduces his defensive impact, be it on the forecheck, backcheck, or in his end. 
Of course, some players with similar issues improved their skating over the years to reach 
the NHL, but despite those past examples of improvements, Pastujov's low drive remains a signiﬁcant ﬂaw. We expected him to increase the tempo under the watchful eyes of hundreds of NHL scouts at the U18s, but we saw no such change.",Offensive-minded forward likes to slow down play and excels on the powerplay.,"Pastujov makes the game look so simple as he maneuvers traffic and makes plays. He plays an effortless-looking game. Through this, he really excels in his deception on the ice, using his head, eyes, feet, change of direction, and change of pace – everything at his disposal – to throw defenders off his path. He carries the puck really well, holding it in his pocket away from the defender and using his body to create further separation. His patience under pressure is so impressive, still scanning the ice even with multiple attackers on him. He is a decent but not outstanding skater, showing good edgework and balance but lacking high-end power in his strides and displaying somewhat heavy feet. Pastujov struggles somewhat in defensive transition, as his acceleration leaves him behind the play more often than not. While he isn't the most explosive skater on the rush, his vision and puckhandling skill allow him to dictate the pace of play and make defenders miss off the rush with a quick deke. His hands are so strong, carrying the puck well, having the ability to handle the puck in a phonebook, jumping into traffic and showing a strong ability to pull the puck out of those battles. He is a very creative and confident player with the puck, showing great patience and vision to open up passing lanes and create scoring chances. Pastujov has great offensive awareness, staying above the puck most times and showing an ability to draw pressure towards him before making a play to a nearby teammate. He has a knack for flashy passing and can thread small lanes through the slot when he's given time to curl off the boards into open ice. He has a quick release on his wrist shot and is a threat on his off-wing, showing an accurate one-timer that makes him a threat on the rush or on the power play. His awareness makes him a reliable defensive player most of the time, getting some looks on the penalty kill and displaying decent body positioning when playing in his zone. He can struggle in his finishing at times, getting a lot of high-danger chances in close and shooting it wide or just not getting the right shot off. Other times, when down a goal especially, he can come up clutch when the pressure is on."
2021,RW,70,174,46,PHI,32,Samu Tuomaala,"Tuomaala didn't have a great club season with Karpat's junior team, but his excellent U18 worlds was a reminder of how good he looked as an underager. Tuomaala is an excellent skater and his shifts have a lot of energy to them because of how quickly he can transition pucks and dart around the offensive zone. He has very good skill and can make plays, but his offense comes through his shot and how he can score from range. For an undersized forward he stays on the perimeter too much, though, and isn't hard to play against. In a sentence, Tuomaala projects as a second-line winger who can be on an NHL power-play unit but may also frustrate a coach.","I really don't love using comparables but Tuomaala gives me another player vibes, for good and bad reasons. I was too high on him in his draft year and beyond and I've tried to re-evaluate why ever since. They're different players, but Tuomaala is a 5-foot-10 shooter who doesn't score as much as he should. Both are players blessed with natural gifts who've always seemed to produce at rates lower than they ought to. He's a better skater than he was at the same age, which should help him run into fewer obstacles as he progresses up levels, but he was also more dynamic with the puck. Tuomaala's a plus-level skater who has good hands and a dangerous mid-range shot that allows him to score some pretty goals, but there are times when I think he forces his looks and takes too many low-percentage shots from the outside. When he plays an up-tempo, energizing game, he's very effective. His skill makes him a lot of fun to watch when he's surrounded by talented players, too (as was the case at U18s). But I do have concerns about his ability to make things happen himself and his processing power (ie. his choices with the puck under duress).","Tuomaala loves to drive the rush and be active in the neutral zone offensively.
In the defensive zone, Tuomaala does a great job of psychologically trapping you.
I would like to see better decision making from Tuomaala. 
Tuomaala has excellent shooting range especially on one-timers and looks to be physical down low in the corners.
Tuomaala's defensive transitional play is solid.
As mentioned earlier, Tuomaala struggles with speed and it's quite evident on the forecheck. 
But, in most cases, we see Tuomaala struggle to move the puck around the last defender when on the rush. He isn't a deceptive stick-handler. ","Scoring goals is what this Finnish winger does, and does very well. A sniper by nature with an outstanding wrist shot, Tuomaala turned heads by potting five goals in seven games for Finland at the under-18 championship. But he also contributed six assists, proving to a world audience there's more dimension to his offensive game than putting the puck in the net himself. High hockey IQ and superior skating aside, Tuomaala is projected as a late-first/early-second round draft selection because he marks up the scoresheet where it matters most.",,"There's something to be said for the straightforward nature of Samu Tuomaala's game. You know what you're going to get from him every time he touches the puck.
Some players just go. They don't ask for permission. They don't play within any structure. They don't need a regimented plan of attack. They just get the puck, and they make a beeline for the opposition goal.
Tuomaala is one such player in the 2021 NHL Entry Draft. He reloads to swing wide on his team's breakout, collects the puck in stride, accelerates through knee-over-knee crossovers, and drives play across the offensive blue line. Blink, and you just might miss him. You can see how Tuomaala leverages that skill in transition captured well in Elite Prospects Dir. of European Scouting Lassi Alanen's data set. He's creating zone entries at 5-on-5 at among the highest rates in Alanen's manually tracked data set from the 2020-21 U20 SM-Sarja season. “Tuomaala's skating is high-end for this level of play, and he can beat defenders outside consistently, which might not be that projectable in the long run but is deﬁnitely fun to watch,” Alanen, who is based in Finland, noted in a January game report.
Any concerns about the projectability of Tuomaala's approach are easy enough to understand. He's not a particularly inventive or creative handler. His habits aren't great either. Tuomaala attacks in a straight line, with the puck out in front of him, and always tries to turn the corner on opposing defenders. He gets serious tunnel vision, misses passing options, and just winds up circling the zone on many occasions, failing to ever register as a scoring threat. He's managed to overpower the defenders at the SM-Sarja just ﬁne, but it's not something our staff would bank on translating at the NHL level. Maybe Tuomaala can leverage his speed to create zone entries, but rush offence in the big leagues might be easier said than done. It won't happen with signiﬁcant skills reﬁnement anyway. That's a shame. Tuomaala has a wicked wrist shot, and he can get it off in-stride from either foot. It's easily an NHL-level tool. It's not like he's particularly adept at ﬁnding soft ice or creating shooting lanes off of the puck in the offensive zone, either.
“I saw the same problems that were present in the U20 league: Slow decisions, tunnel vision 
(missing teammates and opportunities for give-and-gos), late off-puck timing,” Elite Prospects lead scout  wrote in a November game report. “Some of that could improve, but Tuomaala is not incredibly skilled either. The release stands out, but the rest is slightly above-average only. It won't make up for the lack of scanning and processing.”
There are two separating skills in Tuomaala's toolkit: His shot, and his foot speed. He's just lacking the craftsmanship to form them into a cohesive package, and we have concerns about whether he'll ever process the game well enough to change that.
The play for Tuomaala long-term is to probably leverage that work rate, skating, and shot into a bottom-six checking role with some secondary scoring upside.","Another player who excelled at the Under-18 championship, Tuomaala is a small-skilled forward who managed 11 points in 7 games.

Tuomaala has a lot of raw tools and untapped potential. He has elite hands, shot, and skating ability.  Tuomaala can create offense easily off the rush and he is quick and elusive with the puck on his stick. His lack of size is less of an issue because of his explosive skating, agility, and ability to use his edges well.

The biggest question mark surrounding Tuomaala is his ability to read the play and adapt to it. There are times when he struggles with overall on-ice awareness and instead relies on his speed and quickness to create offense. This works well against his peers but may be an issue at a higher level.  

If development goes according to plan, Tuomaala may be one of the better offensive players in this draft. That being said, there are still quite a few question marks and he will likely need extra development time (3-4 years) before being NHL ready.","Tuomaala is sharpshooter with one of the best shots in the class. He has a strong wrist shot, mixed with a quick release and excellent accuracy. He's a quick and agile skater who generates good speed and acceleration with tight crossovers but struggles to beat defenders with speed consistently due to a lack of consistent power and extension in his strides. While this limits his impact as a puck carrier in transition, he has good vision with the puck and he is able to find open space off the rush to get into a good shooting position. He's an advanced playmaker who sees lanes open up and can be deceptive with his intentions. He can make hard, accurate one-touch passes. He can receive and handle the puck in full flight and has the skill to undress defenders or shoot from the rush. He displays a shoot-first mentality, showing the confidence to fire from outside the dot lanes. He has a lightning-quick release and he is able to get heavy shots off without having to take time to transfer his weight. While his proclivity for shooting can make him a bit single-minded off the rush, his creativity and quick feet allow him to be deceptive in the offensive end, creating dangerous passing lanes and open pockets of ice for his linemates. He is more involved from the wing in the defensive end and transition than most of his junior peers, showing some shifts where he's a real difference maker and putting himself into good spots for loose pucks and pass breakups. He's not as engaged physically as he could be, particularly on the forecheck and along the boards in his own end, but Tuomaala is an opportunistic player who shows good awareness and the ability to create scoring chances by himself. There are times when if effort level is lacking, as he hangs back and waits for his teammates to do all the work for him. On occasion, he doesn't dig in for puck battles, is slow on the backcheck, and flies his defensive zone too early. He also doesn't move his feet enough to get open on the power play at times, which wastes his shooting skill much of the time. There are also times where his reads are off, almost like he's not thinking hard enough about the play unfolding in front of him."
2021,C,72,176,30,VGK,33,Zach Dean,"Dean didn't put up as big numbers (20 points in 23 games) as you would have thought he could after his big 16-year-old season, but he did a lot of the things that make you like him as a prospect. Dean is a well-rounded hockey player. He brings NHL-caliber skill to the table to go along with quality skating ability and a high work level. He can beat opponents not only with his hands, but also by taking the puck wide and making a hard play to the net. He wins a fair number of battles and creates turnovers with his hustle. I wouldn't call him a dynamic playmaker. He can make plays with pace and has the vision to create at even strength at the NHL level but doesn't do so consistently. In a sentence, Dean projects to be a middle-six NHL forward at center or the wing who can bring speed, grit and some scoring.","It's impossible to dislike the way Dean plays hockey. He works his tail off, he's always applying pressure without the puck defensively, he's always in motion with or without the puck offensively, he plays on the inside of the ice, and he can be trusted in all situations. That's his foundation. Then on top of that, he's got fast hands, he's one of the better puck transporters through the neutral zone in the draft, he's a fluid skater, and he likes to drive a line. I'm not sure how high his ceiling is but he makes things happen and there are a lot of people in the sport who think he's going to be a good NHLer.","Dean is a playmaker with strong stick-handling skills, a good power stride and a solid backhand shot.

When you watch Dean's game-tape, you will notice immediately that he is a quality stick-handler and can complete windmill stick-handling with ease. He will often utilize his stick-handling each and every shift. In the offensive zone, Dean will use his stick-handling in anticipation of complete a tape-to-tape pass, in medium danger situations where he is trying to cut past the last defender to get into a high danger situation and to frustrate the opposing goaltender and catch him off guard. With that being said, his reach when stick-handling is limited and if he tries to push the puck further out he will have puck security issues. Also, if Dean tries to get a little fancy and flashy with his stick-handling, he will cough up the puck. There have been instances where Dean will attempt to dangle through his legs, but will fail to recapture the puck afterwards due to his limitations with his reach.

Given his affinity for stick-handling, it makes a lot of sense that Dean tends to favor backhand shooting and backhand passing. In fact, most of his shots from down low are backhand shots. Dean has range on his backhand and he can get backhands shots from medium danger on net. Prior to shooting, you will see Dean complete a windmill, get the puck on his backhand and then try his luck. Earlier on in the 2020-2021 season, we saw Dean use multiple windmills against the Shawinigan Cataractes to throw the goaltender off and the find the five hole for a backhand shot goal. While he does take a lot of backhand shots from the perimeter towards the low slot, he does opt to take plenty of wrist and snap shots from low danger. At low danger, he will take plenty of wrist and snap shots, but his selection is far from perfect. He often will choose moments in which he is facing tough pressure and should pivot out or button hook, but instead he will take an ill-advised shot. The majority of his low danger shots don't get a ton of elevation and the goaltender can make a clean stop.

One of the areas that needs further development is his decision-making. Sometimes Dean will see three teammates battling in the corner of the defensive zone for the puck and instead of planting himself at center ice to eliminate a potential open lane, he will join the party which could lead to his opposition scoring should they win the puck battle and find a teammate in the slot. Dean also faces challenges with quick thinking. If a defenseman slides in front of him, he stumbles and carries the puck towards low danger instead of using his stick-handling skills to evade the defender and skate towards the doorstep.

When it comes to his transitional game, it's pretty solid. Given Dean's power stride and crossovers, it typically takes three lengthy extensions for him to generate top speed. So, if Dean is not facing a tremendous amount of pressure in the neutral zone, he can navigate through with ease. But, when facing tighter pressure, he will struggle. He will test his reach and motion the puck further out to stick-handle around traffic, but due to puck security he has challenges with keeping possession. Dean will also have challenges with his edges, especially when using his inside edge to make a quick pivot and turn. Aside from his edges, Dean does struggle on the rush when facing pressure from a defender who is bigger than him. He will struggle to out-muscle the defender and lose possession of the puck along the boards. The goal should be for Dean to work on his upper body strength and further develop his reach. If he does, his stick-handling skill-set will only lead to plenty of successful rushes.

His defensive game is another area that needs further development. He will struggle at executing pressure and often will give up too much room for his opposition to take advantage. Dean needs to exert more pressure in the neutral zone and defensive zone. If not, it will only lead to many scoring chances for his opponents.

From a passing perspective, as I noted above, he will use his stick-handling as part of his wind-up in tape-to-tape passes. But, on occasion, you will see Dean approach a pass as if he is completing a snap shot. He will extend the leg and gather power, but will over-shoot the intended target. But for the most past, his passing is pretty crisp and will sometimes look to utilize his backhand in transition. He will look to make quick backhand zone exit passes.

In the offensive zone, he is quick to puck battles and can hold his own in battles against players with a similar frame. But, when in control of the puck, he likes to carry the puck around the back of the net, go to the right ride, drop a well-timed pass and shift back to the left side of the offensive zone. Given Dean's stick-handling ability and speed, once he gains some upper-body strength and adds to his reach, he could be a handful on the cycle.",,"Some of the slickest mitts in the class, Dean is a creative, puck-pursuing pivot who has strong defensive acumen to go along with his offensive instincts. The box scores haven't always painted an adequate picture of his skill level. There's a lot to work with here. Watch his number explode next season.","Don't let Zach Dean's modest counting stats fool you. He's one of the most skilled players in the
2021 NHL Entry Draft.
Almost every one of Dean's tools grades is comfortably above average. His skating, passing,
puck-handling -- everything but his shot, which isn't all that far off either. It's a great foundation.
The natural place to start with Dean is his skating. His skating posture is nearly perfect, pushing
his knees over his toes to load each stride, and recovering under his torso. When he adds a little
bit of lower-body strength over the next few years -- watch out! He'll be flying out there.
Nobody moves faster than the puck, though. That's why pace is so critical to us when we're
evaluating these players.
Dean plays at a breakneck pace, stacking his skill as a handler and a passer on top of his skating
ability to make plays without a moment's hesitation. His hands work independent of his feet,
with his top arm free from his side, pushed out well in front of him to grant him as much
manoeuvrability as possible. He'll blend pass receptions into dekes, collect difficult passes, and
place the puck in space to outrace opponents if necessary.
“Dean's skill stacking potential and ability to string together different skills are among the best
in the class,” Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting Mitchell Brown remarked in a
March 23rd game report. “Strong, consistent skating posture met with plenty of skating tricks
and in-tight maneuvering. The hands work independently, giving him some inherent deception
to go along with his intentional manipulations. Drives play to the inside, built off pressuring
the middle early in transition and crossing the dotted line. The direction of pressure -- front,
side, back -- doesn't seem to impact his ability to manipulate, looking off plays and maintaining
composure.”
The data Brown tracked from the Olympiques centre's season shows just how effective those
skills were in transition. Dean was a 90th percentile generator of controlled entries at 5-on-5
among Brown's sample of CHL/USHL forwards. Even during sustained offensive zone sequences -- Dean's pace is electric. He'll make strong
off-the-puck reads to determine where he's sending the puck before it's even landed on his stick,
making for lethal one- and two-touch passes.
Dean just doesn't miss playmaking options. He'll find players in his peripheries, pick up the
trailer, and somehow find linemates through layers in the offensive zone. If you get open, he'll
get you the puck. It's just that simple.
The question on the tip of everyone's tongues this season was why Dean's obvious physical
gifts and high-level sense didn't translate to the scoresheet. His 20 points in 23 QMJHL contests
represent an uncharacteristically low number for a first-round pick, much less a player we
tagged with the No 15 overall spot on our board.
When we place those numbers in the context of Jeremy Davis' pGPS (prospect Graduation
Probabilities System), the outlook is pretty bleak. Only seven percent of the players who profiled
similarly to Dean went on to a full-time role in the NHL. Only three of them went on to produce
at a top-six level.
We can explain some of that away with luck. Brown's data set has Dean creating expected
primary assists in the 70th percentile among CHL and USHL forwards. That should net far more
than 10 helpers in 23 games. It speaks to just how many of Dean's fantastic setups died on his
teammates' sticks. On a related note, the Olympiques were the QMJHL's third-lowest scoring
team last season.
It's pretty easy to imagine a scenario where Dean's scoring skyrockets next season. All it would
take is a better supporting cast, and we're talking about a 1.5 point per game player in the ‘Q next
season.
Dean is going to need to bulk up. He's far too easy to push off of the puck presently. Settling for
release plays (going low-to-high or rimming the puck along the boards) rather than sending the
puck into a sea of bodies with a hope pass would be a worthwhile advancement in his game, too. The raw skill that Dean brings to the table is hard to find. He's going to need to land with a team
that has a strong track record of player development to leverage it at the NHL level to productive
ends, but it's undeniably there. He can be a two-way, top-six centre if his development goes well.",Talented center struggles with consistency at times. Could be a steal in the second-round.,"Dean's creativity with the puck on his stick is immediately evident and his puck skills really enable him to create some great offensive chances for his team. He's able to see the play well and can anticipate his opponents that it opens ups some good opportunities to showcase his high-end passing abilities. Those passing abilities in combination with some solid deception with his toes, agile skating and good, speedy directional changes make it difficult for his opponents to pin him down. Dean is an excellent skater on the offensive side of the puck. He has quick feet and his fast recovery time allows him to get a high number of pushes which helps him accelerate to his top speed in short order, launching himself through the neutral zone and attack the defender quickly at the blue line. This also makes him agile and his starts and stops can help him maneuver fairly well through traffic. Dean is a fierce competitor along the wall, combining the mobility in his quick feet and hands to either protect his puck or challenge a rival. He utilizes his edges to create separation by stopping on a dime or cutting a different direction. He enjoys getting his body involved and working with intensity in corners, flashing excellent competitivness. Although lacking a bit of consistency, Dean is willing to put the defensive effort in too, getting on the backcheck with an active stick or supporting his defensemen down low. He doesn't need to lay any hits, or even improve his physicality, but he could engage in more board battles, use his quick hands to dig that puck out and make a smart outlet pass. He does need to continue to build strength though, as he can get outworked in faceoffs and struggle to gain entry to the center lanes of the ice, consistently kept to the edges of the ice when in possession of the puck. He can tend to take the path of least resistance through the neutral zone and into the offensive zone, sticking to the perimeter of the ice. Ensuring that he continues to drive the center of the ice in the offensive zone will also be very important for Dean. While Dean missed a large portion of the season due to injury, he impressed more and more with each game played, earning first-round consideration."
2021,D,73,182,69,CBJ,34,Stanislav Svozil,"Svozil had an up-and-down season, and his ranking is more based on his toolkit than his performance. He is a 6-foot-1 defenseman who can skate and make plays at both ends of the rink. He has enough speed and skill to lead a rush and create offense. He can make creative offensive plays on his outlets and inside the offensive blue line. His gaps are solid, he takes the body and is reliable to play against better players. Some NHL scouts think he lacks enough quickness to play in the league but I think it's just good enough. Svozil has shown the ability to play well versus men and playing ahead of his age group, which are typical indicators of future success. In a sentence, Svozil projects as a third-pair NHL defenseman with enough offense to play higher in a lineup crunch.","I have mixed feelings about Svozil, who helped his stock at U20s only to disappoint me at U18s (with stagnant progression domestically in the Czech Republic in between). When he attacks and plays with confidence, he can look like an entry machine who dictates play when he's on the ice. I really enjoy watching him play when he's activating to join the rush into the high slot and looking to involve himself in the offensive zone. He's got good hands and mobility, particularly moving forward (I think he can struggle with his gaps at times when he's on his heels). But there have been too many times where I've watched him play and he has looked like he's either forcing the issue or he's sitting back much too much. And when a player's games exist at those two polar ends of the spectrum all the time, it's a sign to me that he doesn't yet know who he is or how he can be most effective. That worries me for a kid who may be selected in the first round. There are some tools to like there and he's got a pro frame to grow into but I'm just not convinced his defensive game or his offensive game are strong enough to become more than a third-pairing guy.","So why is there not more hype? What does Stanislav Svozil do well? And where does he need to improve?

Svozil's game is built around his fantastic passing ability and his high-end hockey IQ. In the defensive zone he uses this ability to produce mesmeric outlets that freeze neutral zone defenses and send his forwards into the offensive zone with speed. He attempts passes that others don't even see. Offensively he utilises his vision and touch well to pick out seams in coverages and thread passes cross-ice, onto tape, regardless of how narrow the gap is. As a result he can make what appears a “nothing” situation on the cycle into a scoring chance.

When off of his game he can be prone to feeling pressure, and give-ways when heading up ice due to his predilection for attempting to hit long passes with a high degree of technical difficulty. This is not a major issue, and the positives massively outweigh the negatives, but he still needs to gain poise under pressure. While his passing ability helps him exit his zone regularly, it is complemented by good skating ability as well. Therefore, if there are no passes available Svozil can simply skate his way up ice. Once he gets into the neutral zone his naturally aggressive nature also comes into play. He never seems happy just to make the red-line, but wants to get the puck even closer to danger. His ability to enter the offensive zone with the puck on his stick is just as impressive as his ability to exit his own zone. This is a skill that marks out so many of the best defensemen in the NHL. Svozil is already exceptionally good in this area versus men.

Breaking down his skating further, his agility, acceleration and edge-work are good, but he does have room to improve on his stride and top speed. His stride is slightly shorter than it could be, and is not overly powerful in terms of transferring his energy effectively and building speed. At times he will burst past a man going up ice, only for them to then stay with him or catch him. This may well come with maturity, as he is not quite as physically developed as many of the 2021 draft crop.

Looking more at his offensive zone play, while Stanislav Svozil is extremely dangerous and aggressive on the rush, and creates great opportunities with his passing on the cycle, he can be a bit “safe” in the offensive zone when set-up. Despite not having the biggest shot he can get a bit trigger happy near the blue-line. This is less of an issue when he plays at the junior level. In turn this may simply be due to fear of making a mistake and sending play the other way at the pro level. However, to best utilise his fantastic vision and passing going forward he will need to trust his ability and, in-turn, walk the line more, try and freeze opposition forwards, and do what he does so well on the rush in terms of getting to dangerous positions. Coming back to positives in relation to the offensive zone, Svozil is already fantastic at protecting the puck on the cycle. He has great body position, and his plus hands mean that he can fend off players with only one hand before finding space and dishing the puck. While on the topic of hands, Stanislav Svozil has some silky mitts for a blue-liner. He can beat opponents with a deke or dangle, even at high-speed.

As can be imagined with this skill-set, Svozil is a dangerous power-play quarter-back. He is less trigger happy when he has more time and less pressure in a man-up situation. In turn he has more confidence to quickly move pucks and step-up into a play, or make an opponent bite on a move and walk round them. He is very good at making himself available in man-up situations. With his high IQ he pops up all over the ice in order to find a seam. On the defensive side of things, Stanislav Svozil is solid for his age. One real stand-out ability here is directly related to his high IQ. He anticipates what is going to happen next extremely well. Especially in terms of pucks being turned over, or what passing options opponents will take through the neutral zone. The result of this is that he intercepts passes and gets his stick in lanes with great prevalence. This applies both when defending the rush, and when set-up defensively. The man from Přerov is also very aggressive at his own blue-line and has a good gap for his age, and breaks up a lot of entries with his extremely active stick alongside great back-wards and lateral mobility.

Once set-up in the defensive zone he does have some issues. One is simply strength related, he loses one-vs-one battles in the danger areas to opponents who are more mature than him. But Svozil is not small, and he is also naturally aggressive, so going forward this is not something that should be overly worried about. His aggression can get him into trouble in his own zone though. At times he loses his position puck-chasing, trying to “make” something happen.",,"The Czech product is silky smooth out there. He engages quickly and decisively with the puck, can break out with smart passes, and is always assessing the ice. Took home the Rookie of the Year in the top league last season. Looked very good at the WJC, but quite poor at the U18s. Needs strength more than most. ","Stanislav Svozil may not possess the same offensive upside of some of the defencemen we've
profiled to this point in the draft guide, but few among them can boast his poise with the puck
and sturdy defensive form.
That build has helped Svozil string together two largely successful seasons of professional
hockey in HC Kometa Brno's system by the ripe age of 18. Though he played sparingly in a bit
role for the Czech Extraliga side, averaging a meagre 11:56 of all-situations ice-time a night, it's a
testament to his mature, detailed game that he featured in their lineup at all.
The icing on the cake? Svozil left those minutes with a 51 percent Corsi and 66 percent Fenwick,
according to our partners at InStat Hockey. Prescribed role or not, those are excellent numbers
for an 18-year-old to post in one of Europe's top professional settings.
His success in the Czech Extraliga is the ultimate testament to Svozil's defensive diligence,
habits, and details. He works hard to attach himself to his check, with mirroring footwork and
great body-on-body positioning, driving them into the boards when the moment is right. He's
physical but always with a purpose. You won't see Svozil out there chasing hits for the sake of it.
Good luck getting past Svozil in the neutral zone. He takes away the middle of the ice with
his stick, skates with risk-mitigating footwork, and closes with aggression at just the right
moments.
Svozil suited up for the Czech Republic at the World Juniors and then again at the U18s a few
months later. Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting Mitchell Brown and Lassi Alanen
manually tracked data from those two tournaments, and his work in the latter really shows his
exemplary form as a transition stopper. As an aside, the stark contrast between Svozil's numbers at the World Juniors and the U18s
caught our staff by surprise. To the naked eye, Svozil looked far more effective playing for
Czechia's U20 team than their U18 roster. You can see that reflected in our game reports, too.
The one area where Svozil excelled in both tournaments was as a puck-mover. It was the same
story in the Extraliga, too.
Svozil isn't the greatest handler, but he's a high-pace player, evasive enough as a skater to avoid
crunchy situations where that's a necessity to get past forecheckers. Besides, he mostly breaks
the puck out with well-placed, high-pace passes. He finds the best option rather than settling for
the first player available to him for an outlet pass. If nothing's there, he'll safely deposit the puck
off of the glass and out of harm's way.
The only real downside with Svozil is that there just isn't much going on for the Czech defender
offensively. All of his offensive tools grade out as about average, and he's just not particularly
skilled.
We saw some growth from Svozil over the course of the season. He seemed far more inclined to
jump into the rush or set up in soft-ice in the offensive zone in the back-half of the season than
he did through the front-half. Perhaps that sort of growth augurs something bigger and better
at the next level, but all that newfound confidence won't make up for a general lack of skill or
offensive punch.
That lack of skill may keep Svozil from our first tier of defenders in this draft, but his defensive
details and grace as a puck-mover have him right at the top of the second group. It's just so easy
to project this player to a No. 4 or 5 defenceman's role and a first-unit penalty kill at the NHL
level. That counts for a lot.",Two-way defender starred for the Czech's at the World Junior Championship and against men in the Czech's top league. Could be a second-pairing defender at the NHL level.,"An agile skater, Svozil does an excellent job utilizing his edges and timing to shut down attacks, keep a good gap, and completely take away space from oncoming attackers. Svozil is a strong skater that shows off great speed and an ability to find skating lanes while moving from outside lanes to the inside lane and entering the zone with control. He shows impressive instincts at both ends of the ice. He can read a play and know exactly when to attack the puck carrier, taking the puck and starting the play back the other way. He knows when to attack the offensive zone with a quick rush. Picking up the puck, he reads pressure well, quickly turning one way and make a nice stretch pass to get the puck out of danger. He can do this with his feet too, utilizing crossovers to explode in transition. His feet are incredibly fast. He only uses them fully when he needs to, saving energy where he can. This quick acceleration and power comes from his stance, holding his knees over his toes, while keeping his head and chest square. His constant scanning of the ice results in quick cuts and fast decisions to really spread out the ice. He thinks the game so quickly, you can see both his team and the opposition take a second to register what he's doing at times due to his quick processing and attacks. When moving up ice, he's often able to create plays by making smart, safe passing plays. His ability to defend the rush can be concerning, as his backwards skating doesn't match his forward speed and skill. He can get caught not moving his feet and losing his gap, taking too long to pivot around, at which point he's just trying to keep up to the attacker. Luckily, he's good with his stick which can save him on some occasions. He times his stick checks well, getting in the lane when players are about to pass him or just after they've passed him. However, there are at times when he completes a poke check and stops moving his feet, rather than racing to get the puck or supporting his teammates in puck pursuit via a passing option. He can also struggle physically in forcing himself into areas but that should come as he builds strength."
2021,D,75,187,38,VGK,35,Daniil Chayka,"Chayka has played limited minutes versus men this season and was up and down for Russia's U20 team over the course of the season. His very good stretches showed the promise of what you saw in the OHL. He's a big defenseman who can skate like an NHLer and make a good first pass, which has a lot of value. The offense in his game will never be flashy other than his hard point shot, and while I think he's smart and quick enough to play well at faster paces, his subpar world juniors wasn't inspiring. With his size and feet, he'll make enough stops to justify not having a ton of offense. In a sentence, Chayka has top-pair athletic tools but projects as a second-pair NHL defenseman due to a lack of offense.","I was impressed by Chayka in several viewings this year in the MHL, KHL and at the Karjala Cup, but I also watched him play some ugly games in the VHL and at the world juniors, where he struggled early on with the big role he was given and was eventually scratched. He's a long defender whose active stick breaks up a lot of plays in the neutral zone and is comfortable enough with the puck at the offensive-zone blue line that the Russians have used him on power-play units when he has played with his age group (though that's not saying a lot given the state of the 2002 and 2003 birth years of Russian defencemen). I do find that his long stick can hinder him at the point, where his wrist shots come off of his stick softly because of a high grip and a stilted posture, but he's decently mobile side-to-side, he gets his shots through consistently, and he takes away a lot of space inside his own zone as well as defending the rush (though I have seen speedier players burn him wide and his pivots still need some work). While I understand the appeal of a long defenceman who possesses a mature defensive game and isn't devoid of talent, and he'll definitely be gone before the 47th pick, I don't think there's quite enough skill to the package to warrant a first-round selection.","One of the most impressive attributes about Chayka's play is his reach. But, his reach isn't just good without the puck, it is good with the puck as well. With Chayka's long frame, he uses his reach to his advantage. His reach allows him to take up more space, which gives him more room when possessing the puck. When Chayka does not have the puck and is playing in his own zone, his reach allows him to stand tall and intercept passes that are not coming to his immediate vicinity. If you have quality reach, you do not always have to hover around an attacker to shut down the play. Tight man to man defense isn't always needed.

In the defensive zone, his play is quite similar to University of Michigan defenseman Owen Power. His defensive strategy is to play a more relaxed game until the puck crosses the perimeter. At that point, Chayka plays a bit tighter along the half-wall to eliminate lanes for the attacker to shift towards center ice. But, if the attacker is entering the zone on a quick rush and swings the puck around Chayka towards the boards, he tights up a lot earlier on. When the attack enters the zone through the middle of the ice, Chayka makes eye contact with the forward furthest along in the zone and he knows the trajectory of where that forward is headed. He quickly studies him and will find the best time to sneak in, which can lead to interceptions if the forward furthest along is waiting for one of his teammates to feed him a pass.

While he does play close to the vest, he is not a physical specimen. But, with his frame, it only behooves Chayka to develop a more physical playing style especially when looking to stop the cycle. The goal for Chayka should be to resemble the physical play that Kaiden Guhle (Montréal Canadiens prospect, Prince Albert Raiders defenseman) embodies. But, we do see some aggression, especially when net-front. When Chayka is net-front and battling against attackers who are looking to screen his goaltender, he takes an aggressive tone and pushes the attackers away from the crease.

Aside from his lack of physical play, I have enjoyed Chayka's response to loose pucks and puck movement in general. Chayka is quick on his feet. He will quickly put on the jets to hunt down loose pucks and he will keep his foot on the gas when attackers make sudden changes in direction.

When it comes to transitional play, like most defensemen of his frame, he does not opt to go from zone-to-zone very often. Instead, he will look to make a breakout pass in the defensive zone. Unfortunately, sometimes Chayka is too quick with his breakout passing and does not complete an accurate assessment of the situation at hand. So, he will complete passes to the opposition or fail to get the puck to his teammate. On a lot of Chayka's stretch passes, he seems to miss his target, which will sometimes lead to an icing.

In the offensive zone, I have noticed a difference between his play in the OHL versus his play in Russia. When playing in Russia, his offensive play is more laid back. He will pinch to go after loose pucks along the boards. He will distribute quality passes from the point and will take an occasional shot. But, his shots seem to go the goaltender's pads for an easy stop. With the wider ice surface, I had wondered if he would struggle with his shot when moving back to Russia. It seems that he doesn't have the ability to target a higher spot on the wider ice in Russia. During his play in the OHL, we have seen Chayka rip one-timer shots from the beyond perimeter and elevate a quality slap shot. In addition, Chayka was more inclined in Canada to jump into the slot and find open ice or look for a rebound to pick up and that is something that seems to be missing in his play in Russia.

Last, but not least, let's talk about his skating. His stride reminds me a lot of Boston Bruins defenseman Zdeno Chara. For a bigger defenseman, Chayka has a quality stride. The extension is not too long. It seems to be at the perfect range. His stride allows him to pick up solid speed and he uses that speed to bolt after loose pucks. When on the blue-line, he has great length on his crossovers, which allow Chayka to move faster laterally than most because he doesn't have to take as many crossovers to get him moving. Plus, he knows how to stutter step when completing crossovers. So, picture Tyreek Hill or Alvin Kamara stutter stepping to confuse the defender, Chayka can stutter step just like that and then fire a dart of a shot.",,,"The scouting community has been tracking Daniil Chayka's progress for some time now,
holding him in high esteem for many years. He didn't do himself any favours with his form last
season, though.
His play with the Guelph Storm offered cause for optimism. His lack of physical strength
impacted all areas of his game, but he attempted more plays with the puck on his stick, tried
to support the offence by activating, and his tools seemed to project as above-average for the
NHL in a few years. The defensive mistakes and puck management issues were present then,
but could be chalked up to his age. He was a 17-year-old 6-foot-3 defenceman with a lot of
development ahead. Growing pains were expected. With more experience and strength, you
could picture him playing tough minutes in the NHL.
Some scouts probably fell in love with his tools all
over again this season. Who doesn't want a lengthy
skater with a physical side on their back-end? But
to us, Chayka barely took steps toward becoming
that defensive threat with some complementary
offence. Apart from better footwork and balance,
the defenceman showed the same heavy flaws.
Chayka didn't try to elevate himself above his
setting. He looked disinterested in the MHL, passive
and reactionary. Rarely did he try to push the pace
or use his superior tools to move the puck up-ice
and contribute to the attack in any meaningful
fashion. The points came to him, but not in an
NHL projectable way. He forfeited movement and
passing opportunities constantly to blast pucks on
net. Defensively, Chayka was content defending
the front of the net, something his large stick and
frame allowed him to do relatively well. However,
his stationary approach to the shutdown game
allowed quick attackers to swirl around the zone
and find passing plays higher in the slot. “No pre-scanning with the puck and the thought process behind the plays he makes just isn't
there,” Elite Prospects Russian regional scout Dylan Griffing wrote after watching one of his VHL
games. “He is retrieving the puck with no fortitude or deception. The only redeeming factor in
this game was his skating ability.”
In the KHL, Chayka raised his tempo, showing adequate footwork to close on and contain
attackers on the boards, but he remained puck-absorbed most of the time -- which again made
for a very reactionary playstyle. The rangy defenceman simply refuses to scan the ice enough
to anticipate the position of opponents and the next play. This flaw is especially evident on
retrievals where he is often forced into poor decisions by the forecheck. Chayka's puck play in
the NHL could remain fairly limited, if he gets there at all.
In the end, Chayka is still a player worthy of a draft pick. His tools remain impressive and fit the
NHL game. That said, his late-birthday and flattened development curve should make teams
wary of using a high pick on him. ","Tall, rangy blue-liner struggled against his peers. Has all the tools to be a two-way defender, needs work on overall consistency and gap control.","Chayka is an incredibly rangy defensive defenseman with a real knack for breaking up opposing plays. He is agile and athletic with long, smooth skating strides, and when you combine it with his size and his reach it gives him an excellent range of territory when he's out on the ice. Not only is he great at stepping up to close gaps and take away space, he is also very aggressive and calculated about when he does it, applying pressure at the right times without making himself vulnerable. He's a hard defender to get the puck through or around, showing a lot of proficiency for breaking up opposing possession by stealing pucks or winning it through stick battles. Chayka has the quickness and puckhandling abilities necessary to escape pressure by himself in his own zone, though he doesn't have the hands or the attacker mentality to be a true puck rusher. He's much happier to pass the puck up to one of his forwards while he hangs back, which will be an area of focus in his future development. He displays good instincts from the offensive blue line and gets a lot of power behind his shots, though they're a little wild and he could be more assertive about making that a key part of his game. While his skating is overall pretty good for a defenseman his size, he will need to sharpen his edgework and improve the quickness and fluidity of his pivots to help deal with faster opponents at the next level. His passes are surprisingly slow and weak as well, as he applys too soft of a touch and not enough urgency. Chayka doesn't flash a lot of creativity with his puck movement. You'd like to see him have more bite in the gritty areas of the ice, he seems like a guy who could get outworked at higher levels by hungry opponents who are smaller than he is. Chayka stood out in the 2019-20 season in the OHL, but heading back to Russia for the 2020-21 campaign has proven to be a challenge. His development seems to have stagnated with could be a red flag for NHL teams."
2021,D,69,175,61,COL,36,Sean Behrens,"Behrens is one of the most skilled puck-moving defensemen in the draft who was a big part of the U.S. NTDP and its offense. With the puck on his stick, he's always making a play. He makes great outlets, and his seam-pass percentage rate is very high in the offensive zone. He displays quick hands and can make tough, skilled plays under pressure. The knocks on Behrens are his 5-foot-10 frame and his lack of great quickness for a player that size. He defends well at the junior level due to his great IQ and also his not being shy to play physically, but there are questions on how his game translates to higher levels with his skating. In a sentence, Behrens projects as a third-pair NHL defenseman with enough skill to be on a power play.","Behrens was one of USA Hockey's most consistent players from start to finish this season — and one of the lone bright spots at U18s when the program was hit by injuries and tournament COVID-19 protocols. He's a mobile, active-in-all-three-zones defender who can control a game with his ability to exit his own zone, navigate through the neutral zone, lead entries, and then manage offensive-zone sequences with his calculated aggression and quick reads. He's also got a silky first touch and does a great job identifying his next play before the puck has arrived on his stick. And though his ability to create time and space and then attack is the hallmark of his game, he's also a sound defender for his size who is always engaged, plays a tight gap, and rarely has bad night. I love how fearless he is attacking with his feet off of the line because he can break down structure.","Sean Behrens is your modern-day offensive defenseman. Although he's undersized in some scouts eyes (5'9″), he certainly makes up for it with his amazing on-ice awareness, his hockey IQ, and willingness to play a much larger role physically than his frame shows. On top of that, Behrens is also really good in transition. He uses an impressive combination of speed, skill, and intelligence to elude defenders and set up teammates with scoring chances several times each game.

Defensively, Behrens is right on par with his other draft eligible NDTP teammates. He's more than capable making excellent stretch passes to split the opposing team's defense, and can separate attackers from the puck along the boards with ease.

Like many of the players that rise through the ranks for the USNTDP, Behrens has a well-rounded game. That being said, there isn't really any prospects in this draft that don't have things to work on in their game. Behrens is no exception to that.

In watching film on Behrens, it's noticeable he has a powerful, somewhat-accurate shot. He could definitely look to work on his shooting accuracy, especially when it comes to close-range shooting and one-timers. Behrens could also benefit from working on his puck control a little, but it's still a net positive aspect of his game. He sometimes struggles with having the puck roll off his stick as he's about to shoot, which could also be drawn up to bad luck.

All in all, if Behrens can fine tune some aspects of his game, there's real promise for the player to develop into an everyday NHL defenseman.

Behrens is also quite talented at quarterbacking the power-play for the U18's, as he's shown all season. He has little issue taking a shot from just about any location in the offensive zone, but is more inclined to seek out one of his teammates with a perfectly placed pass. Behrens is without a doubt a solid offensive defenseman prospect. There's countless things to like about his game, both offensively and defensively. Behrens may benefit the best from landing with a team who views him as the perfect fit for a larger, more defensive minded partner. That potential pairing will allow Behrens to utilize his offensive abilities without hesitation. However, there are of course a few areas of his game which could use some work, if he's to develop into a top-4 NHL defenseman at some point down the road.",,,"Sean Behrens is one of if not the 2021 NHL Entry Draft's premier playmaking blueliner. His
position on our final ranking may not seem reflective of that -- nor will actual draft position,
which could be a full round or two out -- but that doesn't make it any less true.
The hallmark of Behrens passing game is its duplicity. He's twisting opponents into a pretzel
with false signals, then sending the puck through their openings with a perfectly weighted pass
that lands right on his teammates' sticks.
He'll posture as a skating threat, only to draw as many opposition defenders into his orbit as
possible, and that creates a tonne of space for his running mates elsewhere. With the puck in his
hip pocket, and the full arsenal of reach-adjusted passes at his disposal, there's little opposing
defenders can do to stop him.
If they pressure Behrens, then he just dispatches of the puck to an open teammate. If they take
a more restrained approach, then Behrens will skate the puck to soft-ice himself. It's a typical
damned if you do, damned if you don't situation, and he makes them happen nearly every time
he steps into the offensive zone.
“Those details make Behrens' playmaking projectable, but skill and vision vault his playmaking
near the very top of the draft class,” Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting Mitchell
Brown remarked in a mid-season profile. “He's not merely deceptive; he's manipulative. He keeps
the puck across his hips, threatening a shot. The release of his shot and passes are identical,
and given that all that pre-puck preparation to beat defenders into space, he's often positioned
to shoot the puck himself. No wonder defenders adjust to the shot instead of the pass, which
Behrens exploits every game.”
That's how Behrens strung together a 28 assist season in 46 games with the USNTDP U18
squad in his first year of draft eligibility. And as good as that number is, we suspect it sells his
contributions short. The data that Brown collected from Behrens season places him in the 100th
percentile generating xA1 (Expected Primary Assists) per hour, and in the 94th percentile for
shot assists, both at 5-on-5. Taking things in the opposite direction, Behrens is also one of the draft's best rush defenders.
He pivots early and surfs across to defend the rush skating forwards, perfectly angling out the
attack before spinning the puck back up ice. In more traditional face-to-face situations, he uses
a nice blend of risk-mitigating footwork and graceful crossunders on the backwards stride,
completed with a good sense of when to close.
It's the same story for Behrens during in-zone defensive situations, where his plus-level habits
make up for his average 5-foot-10 build. He scans regularly off of the puck. He cuts opponents off
at the hands, always from a low centre of gravity. He ties up loose sticks. He mitigates risk with
his positioning. His motor never stops running. His mirroring footwork below the hashmarks
is top-notch. Everything on the checklist gets an emphatic mark in the affirmative.
We even saw Behrens play the body with a little more enthusiasm than usual at the U18 World
Hockey Championships. He sent some poor Czech forward into the shadow realm with one such
bone-crushing hit in the preliminary round.
Truthfully, we haven't many qualms with Behrens' game. There's a lot to like and few holes to
poke in his form. He's a skilled, manipulative playmaker with more than enough in-zone and
transition defensive value to keep his head comfortably above water at evens.
The question is whether Behrens has enough runway to leverage these admirable qualities to
much success at the NHL level. He's about an average skater who lacks much depth through his
stride and has a nasty heel kick on his forward steps. This, in particular, concerns our staff.
You can be a small defender, and you can be a below-average skater. The combination of those
two qualities is a no-go for even some of the most progressive minds in the sport, though. That's
why we anticipate Behrens will fall considerably from the 23rd overall position on our board
and into the second or third round when the picks come in on Day 2.
That makes Behrens one of the draft's foremost market inefficiencies, as far as we're concerned.
You place Behrens in the right situation, with a team that can develop his skating stride, and
you're looking at a player with No. 4 or 5 defenceman's potential who can contribute in both
phases of special teams.","There's a bit of drop in defensive prospects between the likes of Ceulemons and Lambos to Behrens, but he is still a very solid defensive prospect.

Scouts love all aspects of Behrens' game. He is quick, plays in all situations, possesses an excellent first-pass, and excels in transition. Behrens starred for the U.S. at the World Under-18's and showed a high level compete and the ability to create offense from the back-end. Some have compared Behrens game to Nate Schmidt, making him a skilled defender who may rarely put up 40 points, but will help a team maintain high levels of puck possession and can both quarterback a powerplay and kill a penalty.

At only 5'10, 175, some scouts are concerned about his size. However, thanks to his skating and hockey sense, it shouldn't be an issue for Behrens, and he can easily increase his strength in the years to come. He is a potential second-pairing defender at the NHL level.","Behrens is a solid two-way defender who shows some promising defensive shutdown and puck-moving abilities. He's quick, smart and agile. A lot of what Behrens does on the ice is subtle but he's fairly effective on both sides of the puck. He has quick feet that allow him to close gaps on pucks with excellent speed. His strides are incredibly fast and his short recovery time allows him to get his feet underneath him for his next push off with incredible speed. His four-way mobility is also above average and fairly high-end for a defenseman. He's tough to pin down and is able to cover a ton of ground laterally when backpedalling in the neutral zone. Behrens also displays a great ability to anticipate the play and reacts quickly to changing scenarios as they happen in front of him. His mobility and speed definitely help this, but it's his play anticipation and problem solving that really add to his game. He quickly assesses the play in front of him and routinely picks the best possible play he has. This helps him advance the puck in transition. Offensively, he has all the tools to be a really dangerous playmaker from the blue line and while he does a good job of getting the puck to the offensive zone, he doesn't properly utilize his playmaking vision and hands to create opportunities. Behrens seems to be limited in his physical tools. While he is able to work his way into the zone from the point, he still struggles to break through from the perimeter and can be reduced to a nominal threat at best with his shot. There are many times where he should be trying to make more passing attempts to the slot area. Also, while his skating can be arguably the biggest strength in his game, it can also be very inconsistent. When his brain and feet work together he can activate onto pucks quickly and win races to give his team the advantage. At times though, he stops moving his feet when stickhandling the puck or trying to defend the rush and it allowed his opponents to gain positional advantage on him. This gap in his processing and his tendency to puck watch can lead to Behrens becoming a liability in the defensive zone."
2021,D,74,198,40,CAR,37,Scott Morrow,"Morrow played most of the year at Shattuck's U18 team — for a third season — but did get some time with Fargo in the USHL to end 2020-21. It's been tough to get a read on him due to the caliber of opponent he's played, but he has a clear NHL toolkit. He's 6-foot-2, highly skilled, and can skate with NHL players. His skating has progressed over time into a strength, showing the ability to lead an attack and walk the line. He is very confident with the puck and attacks with his skill. He can make plays, but he overcomplicates the game and makes some questionable decisions. Defensively he's just OK. He can be a bit soft on his checks and lack physicality. In a sentence, Morrow has some NHL qualities that give him a chance, but has to add elements to his game to allow him to play.","This season, Morrow dominated the prep school circuit more than just about any player I've watched and tracked in recent years. He's an excellent transition defender who transports pucks confidently, plays boldly inside the offensive zone, and possesses impressive handling skill for a defenceman. At Shattuck, he was an exit/entry machine who carved teams up through the neutral zone with head fakes, side-steps and cuts (his skating really impresses on its edges, even if he's not explosive). When he's on the ice, he wants to take over and direct play in possession and does so by guiding opposing players out of his way. I didn't think he looked quite like himself in his six games with the USHL's Fargo Force but he was jumping into a new team (which already had three established top defenders) and a new league during the playoffs. With some fine-tuning defensively, where he can be a little wayward at times (though some of that has to do with some bad habits creeping in at a level that was beneath him, I think), there's serious upside to Morrow's game.","When it comes to his playing style, he can be handful to skate around. When Morrow moves from the offensive zone to the neutral zone, he tends to play close to the vest and will opt to utilize his stick to push attackers away from his blue-line. Once he gets across his blue-line, he lowers his body and widens his stance. By doing so, he eliminates lanes for attackers. The attackers end up along the half-wall. With that being said, the goal to prevent high danger scoring chances and Morrow does that with his preventive defense specialties. When Morrow is patrolling the boards in his zone, he alters his gap control. Sometimes, Morrow will be right in your face and apply a quality backcheck. He tends to tighten up more so around the red line. Morrow doesn't just stick to his own side. He owns the ice. At a moments notice, he will deviate and switch to the left side if he feels that his defensive partner is struggling at neutralizing the attack.

With his defensive style, you can expect Morrow to be the last defenseman to re-enter the defensive zone and that is due to his aggressive defensive measures in the neutral zone. Morrow thrives in the neutral zone and it would be a mistake to force him to adjust his style. Instead, coaches should expect to pair him with a defenseman who drops back to the net consistently.

From a puck movement perspective, there is a lot to cover with Morrow. His puck movement is quite similar to Barrie Colts defenseman Brandt Clarke. Morrow uses well-timed crossovers in the defensive zone to help drive his acceleration. He will not drive the play through dangerous situations. If there is an attacker bearing down on him, he adjusts on the fly, drops back and tries a different lane. But, he doesn't just drop back in the neutral and defensive zones, he also plays it safe in the offensive zone when traffic is in front of him. When controlling the puck in the neutral zone, like Clarke, he will zig-zag around to avoid confrontations with his opponents.

While he is effective at controlled transitions, there are instances in uncontrolled transitions where Morrow runs into some problems. Sometimes Morrow's decision-making on his first pass is off the mark and his passes lead to turnovers in front of his net. In addition, when he is finding the right teammate to pass the puck to and shifting around traffic in his own zone, there are instances where Morrow struggles to keep the puck on his stick and that leads to cough ups without much contact from opponents.

Morrow's skating is quite strong. His foot extension is long, which allows him to take fewer strides when in transition. The recovery is not too wide, which is critical for strong mobility. His edges and crossovers are the main drivers for his acceleration and come in handy when navigating/stick-handling in the offensive zone.

In the offensive zone, Morrow loves to pinch, skate up the boards and complete centered passes to the slot. While you would expect Morrow mostly to pinch and control the cycle on the right side of the ice, that is not always the case. As mentioned above, Morrow likes to command the game and will alternate between rushing up the left and right side. Additionally, you can expect Morrow to charge through the slot and will use his stick-handling skills to swerve around attackers. All-in-all, his offensive play is quite strong, but I would like to see some refinement on his shot. When Morrow is shooting from the blue-line, his shot goes wide quite a bit. But, any time that you are taking a long-range shot, you need to expect that the chances of the puck reaching the net and not bouncing off the boards are much lower than if you are shooting from the slot or right at doorstep.",,,"There's no way around it: Scott Morrow's one of the trickiest projections in the draft class. He
was beyond the Prep circuit last year, yet returned for another season. While he often flipped the
switch and dominated, just like he should, major questions went unanswered.
“Morrow's offensive game is built on exerting sustained pressure, comprising manipulation,
activation, and the use of his plus four-way mobility to exploit poorly gapped defenders and
over-zealous forecheckers,” Elite Prospects American high school regional scout Daniel Gee
wrote in a mid-season profile.
With constant hip pocket deception, changes of pace, and eyes that never reveal the intended
play, he embarrasses defenders. After breaking down a defender, he continues the manipulation
to drag over another defender, before rolling his wrists, turning the fake shot into a pass to an
open teammate. Even with flawed, power-limiting shooting mechanics, Morrow's not shy about
stepping in and firing.
In transition, Morrow uses that same manipulation ability to great effect. For him, the
manipulation starts on the retrieval, where he misdirects opponents. In open ice, those fake
shots become fake passes, looking in an open direction just long enough to bait the forechecker
in one direction before going the other.
Projectability concerns start with Morrow's skating, which lacks ankle flexion, hip engagement,
and power. Acceleration isn't any better, as he tends to keep his weight on his heels, and his low
pace of operation only amplifies the skating concerns.
Sometimes, Morrow's a physical, aggressive defender with some play-killing ability. Mostly, he's
low-energy and reactive, as Elite Prospects lead scout St-Louis describes: “failed to take the extra
stride to cut a play that led to a high-danger chance at least twice.”
Rush defence often highlights a lack of translatability to higher levels, as Gee explains, “he won't
be able to overpower opponents with his aggressiveness and he will have to learn to better guide
rushing attacks better.”
According to David St-Louis, there are some questions about the scalability of the offence he
creates: “the general formulaic aspect of his offensive game (the same moves every time). Is he really manipulating or has he learned tricks so well that they work anyway even if the timing
isn't exactly right?” A late-season stint with Fargo helped answer that question in part, with his
moves being largely the same but his timing and pace adapting to the better competition.
Morrow could become a flashy, puck-moving second-pairing defenceman, even his critics see
that upside. But the uncertainty of his projection keeps him just outside the top-50. He heads to
UMass next season.",Offensive-minded blue-liner excelled at college prep school. NCAA will be an excellent challenge and determine ceiling next season.,"Morrow is a highly-skilled defender who can be a difference-maker on offence with his high-end skating and puck skills. His footwork is exceptional. He might be one of the best skaters in the class, at least amongst defensemen. It all stems from his posture, strong ankle flex, good knee bend, lets his shoulders roll, but keeps his chest and head up. He can explode in all four directions. He also utilizes crossovers very often, constantly changing direction up the ice as he leads breakouts and entries. If he doesn't use his feet, he can look up the ice and spot his teammates through traffic, often shooting long bombs from his zone to the opponent's blue line to spring his man. His puckhandling is also high-end, as he has the ability to skate into and out of traffic, often coming out with the puck. This combination makes a very promising offensive player. Morrow also brings a calmness to his game, drawing attackers in before making a play. He can combine all of these aspects at times, although this also transitions into the less-than-positive traits. However, when he gets too focused on getting through or past traffic, he puts blinders on and gets too focused on himself. He doesn't notice the wide-open teammates he has and then ends up not using his teammates and runs out of space, leading to a turnover. Where Morrow really shows cause for concern is in his defensive game. There's a lack of both urgency and awareness in his own end, resulting in missed assignments, missed pucks, and numerous turnovers. Much of this can be associated to a lack of scanning the zone. He tends to get too focused on the puck or what is in front of him and loses where his opponents are. He can also make some poor decisions, such as trying to force a pass through traffic in front of his own net. When defending the rush, he also tends to skate right at his attackers. While this may work for him now, it's not something that will translate. He needs to learn to angle out, taking away the attackers space and forcing them to the boards rather than skating right at them. He also maintains his gap and speed when skating backwards through crossovers rather than cuts, which will see him exploited at the next level."
2021,LW,70,168,73,DAL,38,Ayrton Martino,"Martino ended up in the USHL after the BCHL's delayed start and was a big part of a competitive Omaha team. Martino is a high-skill type who makes a lot happen with the puck. He doesn't make a lot of plays through defenders, but he shows very quick hands and the ability to make plays in small areas. He showed he could run a power-play flank and make plays in motion. He's elusive enough with his skating, but for a smaller player, you'd like more straightaway speed. Martino works hard enough to win pucks and force turnovers and kill penalties for Omaha but he isn't an overly physical player and can be a bit perimeter. In a sentence, Martino projects to play NHL games but his size/skating combo may keep him from sticking as a full-time player.","Martino's one of the oldest players on this list (born Sept. 28, 2002) but he's got a three-year track record of strong age-adjusted results at two different junior levels. Stylistically, he's one of the very best problem-solvers in this draft class. He never really looks like he's in trouble because he's constantly surveilling his options, he pivots into and out of traffic effortlessly, and he finds teammates on the backside of coverage incredibly well. I watched him make dozens of small-area plays through four or five bodies from a standstill to set up a teammate for a high-danger chance in my viewings this year. He's not the fastest skater, nor the strongest player, nor the hardest shooter, but there's a poise and understanding of spacing to his game that makes him hard for defenders to disrupt. I'd like to see him engage himself in the play a little more without the puck but it's his ability to slip in and out of pockets of space and make soft skill plays all over the ice (including off of his backhand) that will carry him.","In the grand scheme of things, Ayrton Martino is a talented, offensive-minded playmaker with a natural eye for seeking out some exceptional passes. His playmaking ability is off the charts, which pretty much every NHL team should be looking for in a prospect.
Offensively, Martino comes as advertised. There isn't much he doesn't do exceptionally well in the attacking third of the ice, and would be a solid addition to every team's prospect pipeline.

Defensively, his game could use some work, as mentioned above. Perhaps it's more of a system implemented thing, but there's little doubt Martino isn't able to adapt relatively quickly to a more structured system.

Overall, Ayrton Martino would be a very good add to any NHL team looking to bolster it's offensive output, especially if Martino can be had with a second-round pick. It's hard to deny the skill and production Martino brings, and it would not come as a surprise to many if he's selected with a late first round pick.",,,"Even with two high-scoring OJHL seasons under his belt, it wasn't clear just how effective
Ayrton Martino's stretch-the-ice, high-pace attacks would be in the USHL. After scoring nearly
1.5 points per game, he left little doubt that his offensive mind is NHL-calibre.
One of the draft's most interesting case studies, Martino developed skills and pace without
having the mechanical base -- skating -- down. As Daniel Gee explains, “his biggest deficiency is
his skating and how it blends with his other offensive tools.”
He lacks ankle flexion, failing to push his knees past his toes, which greatly limits his push off
power. Wide recoveries with short extensions only amplify the posture issues, as does an overrotating upper-body. The inconsistency of his lower body suggests strength will help his skating
issues, but without mechanical improvements, his lack of depth will always limit his balance,
puck protection, crossovers, and speed.
Those skating issues haven't prevented Martino from becoming one of the draft's best rush
attackers. He continually generates odd-number rushes or breakaways, and he's not cheating
the defensive zone.
“Martino moves so well off the puck to find pockets of space offensively in areas where he
can get off a quick shot,” Elite Prospects American regional scout Joey Padmanabhan wrote
in a March game report. “On the rush without the puck, he sneaks behind defenders and gives
himself chances for breakaways and open shots.”
When possible, he builds speed underneath the puck to minimize the effects of his skating, and
he adjusts his route to ensure he's always a passing option.
Primarily a playmaker, Martino avoids handling the puck when possible. He has some onetouch deking ability, but he understands how to play pro-level offence already. He's a master of
the give-and-go. He identifies the best play before receiving the pass, then one-timer the puck
to an open. Hook and slip passes allow him to contort his puck positioning to pass through
defenders Few prospects are better at chaining pass receptions, handling, and quick-possession
playmaking, as Elite Prospects Dir. of North American Scouting Mitchell Brown illustrates, “In
full flight, he puts tricky passes directly into his hip pocket or into space to beat defenders. That
trait led to an assist, kicking the puck to his stick before rifling a cross-slot pass for a backhand
deflection.”
Late to pockets of space around the slot, Martino's not an instinctual scorer, for all of his off-puck
awareness. His shot's more concerning, lacking lower-body control and depth from his skating
posture. Inconsistent upper-body mechanics limits his power and control.
Despite the by-design zone flying, Martino's a high activity defensive winger who cuts off the
top, denies point shots, and rips away possession on the backcheck. For most players, such
significant skating flaws would be crippling. Martino's found a way to overcome them, but
improvement's required to make the NHL. He doesn't need a perfect stride, but he'll need to get
close to NHL average. If he can do it, he could become a playmaking top-nine winger. ",Transitioned well to USHL. Excellent hockey sense and agility. Could be a second-round sleeper.,"When watching Martino, you can tell he likes having the puck on his stick and is always hungry for offense. He understands how to find open lanes very well and is constantly taking advantage when space is given to him. He will wear you down by just collecting the puck and coming right back at you immediately. It allows him to slip behind defensively and pick pocket the puck too. He reads the play very well and is constantly anticipating the play, trying to get an extra step ahead of opponents. He has very quick feet and is able to generate acceleration very efficiently, being a constant threat and keeping defenders on their toes. He is able to handle the puck well through the neutral zone and made offensive zone entries with control and also showed some skill with a nice toe-drag around a defender to show off some flash to his game. In the neutral zone, he is constantly turning so as to not lose momentum. He is always aware of who has the puck and his positioning since he wants to receive a pass already moving with speed towards the Ozone. Whether that is jumping the zone or just a few strides to start him off, he wants to be dangerous immediately. He has short crossover strides and he doesn't use the length or power of his stride anywhere near to what he could but relies on this constant motion and shifting positioning to be elusive. It helps him be deceptive as it is hard to keep check on a player who never stands still. Martino could show more effort and engagement in board battles, a stronger use of his shot when his team has zone possession, and him engaging more defensively instead of always trying to get a step. Overall, he'll need to be more engaged in the defensive zone and challenge opponents more. He applies good pressure at times and can show the ability to make a nice takeaway with a stick lift, but it just needs to be more consistent. A red flag with Martino is that it seems like he's thinking about what he's going to do in the offensive zone before even having the puck, which does raise concerns about his defensive awareness and commitment."
2021,LW,70,181,126,TBL,39,Dylan Duke,"Duke has been a tough evaluation case for me for a long time. You watch him and his toolkit looks rather vanilla. He's 5-foot-10 and is a fine, but not explosive, skater for that size. He has skill and playmaking ability, but it doesn't pop. He just works very hard and finds a way to score a lot, particularly around the net-front area. There are NHL scouts who don't believe in him, and that's reasonable, but every time I've watched him, he drives the play and scores and coaches tend to play him a ton. His game may not translate to higher levels but for now, I'm a believer. In a sentence, Duke projects to play NHL games due to his skill, scoring and work ethic but may have issues sticking due to his size/skating combo.","Duke's a stocky player with a nose for the net who plays bigger than his size, stays on top of pucks when he's being leaned on, and always seems to be open. There are mixed opinions on how his game will translate, though. I've had at least one source say they prefer Duke to Pastujov, and another say they wouldn't take Duke in the draft's first two rounds due to worries about his average footspeed. I'm a big believer, though. He plays an impressive 200-foot game, he's tenacious, he loves to drive the crease and make plays into bodies, he regularly outmuscles bigger opponents, and he's got quick hands and a wrist shot that can cleanly beat goalies from mid-range. He's not going to be a one-and-done, or even two-and-done player in college (especially with the depth the Wolverines have, which may mean it takes him some time to get opportunities atop the lineup), but I wouldn't be surprised if he becomes one of the NCAA's top forwards as an upperclassman. If he can improve upon his acceleration, that'll go a long way.","Dylan Duke projects as a top 9 forward, best suited on the wing, who can provide a dominant net-front presence, and can probably net 45-50 points per season at the NHL level. That being said, there's a little bit of his game that can use some fine tuning, which will definitely come as he transitions to the NCAA with the Michigan Wolverines. Teams should absolutely fawn at how developed his defensive zone game is at just 18 years old, and his offensive production has been constant at every level he's played at.

The 2021 NHL Draft has a few “diamond in the rough”-caliber prospects in the late First, early Second round range, and Duke is certainly at the top of that list. Teams that are selecting in the 20-35 range, and are looking for that scrappy, “jack of all trades”-style forward, look no further than Dylan Duke.",,,"Dylan Duke's likely the most limited player inside the top-50 of the Elite Prospects draft board for
the 2021 NHL Entry Draft. He might only be NHL average or above in one area, the net-front, but
that single dimension might be enough to make sure all the rest doesn't matter.
From the hash marks and in, few prospects are more effective than Duke, draft-eligible or
otherwise. While he plays between checks and finds space from which to shoot, he's best when
weaponizing puck battles. He engages with the net-front defender, establishes body position, and
then pushes off just as a puck comes near. From there, he spins around and fires, hammers away,
and occasionally shows some deft in-tight handling skill.
Even if Duke can't find space, he still finds a way to deflect the puck or whack away. As the sport
moves away from the stationary net-front presence, Duke's movement and timing around the net
will become even more important.
While Duke prefers to shoot, as is the nature of the net-front presence, he's one of the craftier
down-low playmakers in the class. On retrievals, he maps out the ice with a series of shoulderchecks, then quickly moves the puck to an open teammate. That awareness appears around the
crease, where he'll turn rebounds into tap-ins for teammates with one-touch feeds or backhand
the puck out of a scrum to a teammate in the slot.
By anticipating the next play on the forecheck and backcheck, Duke intercept passes and
pickpockets opponents. More energetic close-outs on the point, activity down low, and off-puck
threat elimination would make a positive defensive player at the next level.
Duke's transition game poses a significant hurdle going forward. “Don't give him the puck in
transition: it's a dump-in fest, and without planning or speed,” Elite Prospects Dir. of North
American Scouting Mitchell Brown noted in an April game report. “He's just giving the puck to the
other team. Seven failed entries at 5-on-5 in this game.”
In Brown's CHL and USHL data set, Duke saw his controlled entry percentage drop from the 81st
percentile last season to the 18th this season. But it didn't come with an uptick in retrievals as
one might expect, with his dump-in recoveries and forecheck retrievals dropping from the 96th
percentile to the 55th. His zone exit numbers are equally concerning. Much of Duke's transition woes are traced to skating. “Average straightaway skater, fatigues
easily, and tends to stand up too high in his stride,” Elite Prospects American regional scout Joey
Padmanabhan noted in a report.
He can't separate with his feet, and in open ice, his hands aren't much better. If he's not turning the
puck over immediately, his transition attempts are usually straight-line, up-the-boards attacks --
too easy to defend, even in the USHL.
In addition to skating and skill improvement, Duke will have to start using his teammates in
transition, looking inside for passing options and working give-and-goes. If he does it, along with
elevating his defence impact, he could become a goal-scoring third-line winger.","Led his team in shots on goal this season, but not goals. Small, but quick. Well-rounded offensive player.","Duke is a quick and agile skater who plays at a high tempo throughout the entire game. He is constantly applying pressure in all zones, while contributing offense and creating space for his team. He has quick feet, that allow him to change direction quickly and be very elusive, making him hard to slow down and defend. He has good puck control and was very efficient on the cycle, keeping possession of the puck while creating passing plays with teammates. He protects pucks well and make dekes in-tight to create space where there seems to be none. Duke makes effective passes to teammates consistently and uses his vision to find small passing lanes, hitting his passing target often, even through traffic. He has a great nose for the net and understands where he needs to be consistently, being able to set up in high danger areas for many scoring chances while also being very effective at finishing rebounds. He often supports his teammates while under pressure, giving them a passing option and using his stick actively to retrieve pucks for his team. In the defensive zone he is consistently aware and applies good pressure on the puck carrier. He is active with his stick and looks to take away passing lanes and options while also showing his hunger for the puck, often looking to stick lift and steal pucks away. He's not a particularly high-end skater because of his shorter stride, but he can win footraces with his determination, energy, and footspeed. He can lack the creativity to get the puck from those open areas to more dangerous areas consistently. In this sense relying much more on brute force than finesse. At the same time, he does show really solid vision with his passing when under pressure and can reliably progress the puck and utilize his competitiveness to create time and space for his teammates and get the puck to them. Duke has some goal-scoring upside because his shot is hard, accurate and comes off of his stick quickly, and he can shoot off the rush with little trouble. However, his combination of size and skating will be a challenge for him and will probably keep his ceiling low, but given his mentality and approach to the game it's easy to see how he could carve out an NHL career."
2021,LW,75,175,45,CGY,40,William Stromgren,"Stromgren took positive steps this season, becoming a good scorer and looking competent versus men. Stromgren's physical tools are easy to spot when he's on the ice. He's 6-foot-3, can skate and has great hands. He has the ability to create clean zone exits and entries with a high frequency due to his reach, speed and skill. His offense is very north/south and direct, as while he can make some plays I wouldn't call him a great passer. He's not a physical player or a top PK option, but Stromgren gets to the net and creates around the tough areas of the ice. In a sentence, Stromgren has some clear NHL attributes but with his sense and compete, his NHL role is unclear.","I've talked to a number of scouts who have Strömgren as a first-round talent in this draft, and I debated him as high as 27th or 28th (I think he'd probably be a reach for me in front of any of the players 26-and-up on my board) throughout this process. Though the gut instinct with a player his height is to expect them to play a power game, Strömgren is more of a skill type. He'll beat you with a quick backhand-to-forehand cut into a scoring chance, but he doesn't play a power/physical game and he still has some room on his frame to get a little stronger so that he can play a more forceful style. He's very comfortable with the puck on his stick for a player his size, which helps him carry the puck over the line and make plays in transition with his decent speed. After dominating the junior level, he didn't look out of place in Sweden's second or third-tier pro levels this year either. I don't think he's ever going to be the primary driver on an NHL line, which kept him out of a first-round ranking, but he's got a chance to be a complementary scorer and I've been impressed by his ability to find teammates through layers as a passer.","Throughout his junior career the big forward has stood out due to his skating ability. It is rare to see a player with such a large frame for his age burn smaller defensemen, let alone out-manoeuvre them in close, but against players his own age Strömgren is capable of just this. Now, he has not fully grown into his frame yet, and as such he can occasionally look slightly “bambi-like”, especially with his up-right skating style. But the lower body strength, edge-work, and power when in stride are there already. Strangely, Strömgren actually looks a better skater with the puck on his stick that with-out, as he seems to get lower to the ice and in turn waste less energy. That being said, skating will never be an issue for Strömgren, and with some extra strength he will likely be able to drop a shoulder and get past most NHL defensemen in future. Arguably his stand-out skill is his shot. His one-timer is up there as one of the best in the draft, and leaves even pro goalies stranded in Allsvenskan. The way he shoots is beautiful to behold. Most players “hammer” the puck to get velocity. He seemingly “caresses” it into a corner at high speed. Fluid and efficient with a hint of elegance is how you would describe his one-timer from the right side. His wrist-shot is of a similar calibre and equally beautiful to watch. The power he generates defies the ease with which he leans into his stick. That, allied with a great eye for a corner, means goalies often don't get the chance to move. His release is so quick and effortless that if there is even a slight screen the goalie won't even realise a shot is incoming, especially with the proficiency that Strömgren has shooting in stride. His strength and willingness to get to the net also means he can do the dirty work in close. His passing is not on the same level as his shot. However, it is not a deficiency. From a technical perspective when he sees a pass he can effect it no matter what the difficulty level. The issue at times is that he does not see some passes that he should. Part of this is as he is primarily a goal-scorer, and wants to get to the danger areas instead of waiting for a precision pass. Part of this is also likely due to a small degree of “puck-hog” buried inside of him. Part of this is likely as while technically extremely proficient in every area his hockey IQ is not quite the same level.

For a big man the Swedish winger has soft, deceptive hands. Not only this, he has the confidence to use them. He can manoeuvre the puck in close to any way you can imagine, while in stride. As such, he is also able to use this ability to help unleash his high-end shot, manipulating defensemen to make them stand off, or re-positioning the puck from a bad pass at the last minute from heel to toe to pick a corner. However, there can also be a downside to this. Hubris. At times that is what it appears Strömgren has with the puck on his stick. Especially when playing against men. There were some games where he was a turnover machine due to making one too many moves or trying to dangle past a player when it was not on. He did clean this area up as the year went on, which is a positive, but it will always be in his natural mind-set to take players on, and hopefully he can continue to be more selective in this area.

As a forechecker Strömgren uses his good skating and reach, alongside his willingness to engage physically, to harass opposition defensemen and make their life hell on the break-out. His extremely active stick at times comes from no-where to disrupt a pass or steal a puck off a stick. He does not seem to be as intuitive as the best fore-checkers in this area – he can occasionally chase too far or get crossed up with own line-mates — but you cannot fault his willingness and work-rate here. With more maturity here with his skating and frame he could be a juggernaut on the fore-check even in the NHL. Once on the cycle or protecting the puck down low even fully grown men with 10 years of pro experience struggle to relieve him of the puck.

What is confusing at times is his work inside the red-line. He is willing to get back. But in contrast to his fore-checking he does not move his feet enough at times and can get caught puck-watching. Additionally, he has been guilty of mis-reading plays too often and getting himself out of position as a result. Work ethic here is seemingly not the issue though, it just appears that he can be prone to that “rabbit in headlights” feeling in the defensive zone. This should be rectified with more experience and good coaching going forward, but don't expect the young Swede to be ever anything more than “solid” defensively.

As you can probably infer from all of the above, Strömgren is raw. He has a wonderful set of tools, and he has really started to begin figuring out exactly how to arrange them within his toolbox. If he can continue to progress both mentally and physically over the next few seasons he will be an NHL player. Given his skill-set it is very possible that the hulking winger ends up a good second line winger who can potentially hit 20 or more goals a season with some regularity. He will be a good pick-up for a team in the second round of the 2021 draft.",,,"William Stromgren's profile -- above-average size, skating, and hands -- is always a hit at the
NHL Entry Draft. It's easy to see why. Teams want toolsy prospects in their lineups, especially
when those players offer an impressive range more broadly.
There is an inherent risk with these types of players though. They sometimes struggle to
leverage their above-average tools towards a productive NHL career. They also sometimes turn
into pitfalls, as has proven to be the case, to some degree, for Stromgren.
The Swedish winger's 1-on-1 skills are among the best in this draft. His processing speed and
ability to read defenders allow him to register incoming poke checks at the precise moment
they are initiated. His reaction time and close-to-perfect technique let him avoid them entirely.
And Störmgren doesn't only react to opponents; he often dictates their movement, opening them
up through creative manipulations, hesitations, freezes, and fake moves before threading the
puck through them.
Like many other danglers, Stromgren's calling card is a bit of a double-edged sword. He treats
opponents like pylons in an obstacle course, one he must clear. Instead of improving his
percentages by attacking space, making give-and-goes, or protecting the puck with his frame
-- NHL translatable moves --, Strömgren makes defender's lives easier by bringing himself to a
glide before engaging them. His success rate in 1-on-1s is relatively high compared to his peers,
but it's destined to wane as the talent pool compresses.
What gives us hope is that Stromgren's decision-making problems result from untamed
ambition rather than a lack of vision. He registers outlets most of the time, and can reach them
with a variety of deceptive and skillful passes, and even pull off the occasional give-and-go to
create a shooting lane for himself. The problem is, there are too many instances where he looks
off his support, teammates in much better positions, to try and piece together a dangle sequence
through defensive formations. “The skill is still there; the instant dangles, high reaction-time, deceptive passing and dangling.
He also uses his body...sometimes,” Elite Prospects lead scout David St-Louis wrote in a February
game report. “You can build an NHL player out of his package of skills, but it won't be easy.”
Whichever team drafts Stromgren will have to recalibrate his offensive mentality to coax a
productive top-six forward out of this raw collection of skills. He undoubtedly has the skills to
fill such a role.
His hands, shifty as they may be, have to become just one of the many different cards he
plays against the defence. He has to better identify the conditions in which a dangle attempt
is appropriate, such as acquiring a speed difference or against an off-balance defender, and
developing his pass-and-support game to diversify and increase his offensive threat.
One last important element: Strömgren might be an above-average skater based on form, but his
stride rate and overall pace remain pretty low. He will need to elevate his work rate to complete
his development to the NHL.",Big winger improved as the season progressed. NHL size and shot.,"Stromgren is a big winger who has a lot of impressive tools, but is still learning to master all of them. He has quick first steps that helps him to reach top-speed effortlessly and he has great agility and puck control which makes him hard for defenders to stop. He's a big winger who moves well for his size. His balance and power stand out. Stromgren keeps a nice, wide stance when slowing down in the offensive zone to protect the puck. His stickhandling is really strong, an attribute you don't see often on big players. Stromgren has a direct and powerful style and tries to find solutions by being creative with speed. His speed helps him to create space both for himself and his linemates, and he found his line mates with hard, accurate passes. He uses his size and strength to protect the puck, and this combined with his speed, makes it hard to knock him off the puck. He can make a few impressive moves in a row to put himself in a dangerous scoring situation, but does need to improve his finishing ability and decision making once in those areas. He can play quickly when moving in the cycle or while stationary and moving pucks around with his teammates. Stromgren has a great release on his shot, it's hard and accurate, and his passes are often that way as well. He can make the no-look cross-ice passes through traffic. He shows some shifts his motor, going in for an offensive chance, doubling back for the puck, and then going in for another chance. However, his effort level is inconsistent. He can coast or skate leisurely a little too often, especially on the backcheck. When he does backcheck, he is active with his stick in both covering areas and chasing the puck. He needs to improve his positioning in his own zone though, as he can be in the wrong place and leave opponents with more space then he should. He can overwork situations and he could be more calm in his play and read the game instead of chasing the puck. He also seems to have issues with his hand-eye coordination, as there are instances where he struggles to receive easy and wide-open passes. He could also use his frame better, as he lacks a physical edge."
2020,LW,73,193,1,NYR,1,Alexis Lafreniere,"Lafreniere has shown for years that he is a unique prospect who projects to become a foundational player for an NHL franchise. He's dominated the QMJHL, scoring more than two points per game this past season. He was the MVP of the world juniors and has been great at other international events. I remember going to games where I thought he didn't look himself and he still put up multiple points. He has truly elite skill and some of the best hands I've ever seen. Lafreniere has made some of the most creative plays I've seen in the past few years, and with his skill he's always a second away from a scoring chance. He beats defenders in unique ways and catches them off guard with the moves he makes. He's also a very good passer who makes quick, crisp passes, and his elite creativity translates to his playmaking. He has a great shot, too, with the ability to score from mid-distance. On the power play he's a menace due to how he can beat defenders 1-on-1, find seams or pick corners. Lafreniere is a highly competitive player who plays well in the hard areas of the ice, is solid defensively and plays physical. He sometimes pulls up a bit too much to use his skill and playmaking, but he shows no fear driving the net. His skating and pace is the area to point out if you were to pick a weakness. I debated between a 50 or 55 for his skating. I see good flashes from him with his skating, but I see a lot of shifts where his game lacks speed and pace, and he doesn't seem to have truly explosive quickness; but he is quick enough and when he wants to go he has enough speed to look like he can be an average NHL skater.","Lafreniere wasn't just the most talented player in junior hockey this season, he was also probably the strongest on his skates (which says something considering underneath one of his skates was a taped ankle for most of the year). He can play through defenders with his touch and stickhandling ability. He can play around them with his speed. Or he can lean on them, leverage his strength, drop his shoulder and drive to his spot. And when he doesn't have the puck, he knows how to get open, where to go to get it and how to engage physically. He's never going to be the fastest player in the world or have the hardest shot, but he has all the tools he needs to be a dominant player with and without the puck at the NHL level.

His shot has also become an underrated quality to his game. He made waves when he scored 42 goals in his first of three QMJHL seasons but scouts began to question how dangerous his shot was when his goal pace dropped in each of the next two seasons. I've seen some nice growth there, though. When his production really began to skew toward playmaking this season, it looked more like a choice than a necessity.

He can overpower goalies when he wants to lean into it:

But he also does a good job getting his shot off under pressure or releasing from an off-balance stance, as he does here:

He could've broken the 50-goal mark across a full season if he wanted to. There were times this year where he looked downright bored out there:","Lafreniere is stunning in transition. His ability to get the puck through tight gaps is something that many prospects at his age struggle with. 
In the offensive zone, Lafreniere can do everything that you want him to do. When it comes to his shot, Lafreniere fires at all cylinders and he can burn you from anywhere in the offensive zone. Also, Lafreniere loves to run the cycle and running the show. 
The defensive zone is Lafreniere weakest zone, but he is still strong defensively. Last, but not least, Lafreniere's skating is effortless. As I mentioned before, his crossovers and his edge work are constantly in fine form. ","There is no debate at this point as to who should go No. 1. It's Lafreniere by a significant margin. Over the past 20 years, only two players 18 years old or younger had a points-per-game average higher than Lafreniere's 2.15 this season: Sidney Crosby and Jonathan Drouin. Lafreniere thinks the game at a high level, with elite anticipation and an understanding of what to do with the puck immediately after he gets it. He has a physical edge and initiates contact more than most top picks of recent years, separating players from the puck with regularity. We've seen Lafreniere's emotions get the better of him at times, but he has a competitive fire. He wants the puck at all times, in all situations. And he has the skill and hands to make things happen when he has it. Few other players exude the level of confidence Lafreniere has shown over the past two seasons.","He's the best playmaker in this year's draft, a physical specimen who combines otherworldly hockey sense with sublime puck skills to form the complete offensive package. Alexis Lafreniere is going to step into the NHL whenever the 2020-21 season starts, and he'll make an immediate impact wherever he lands.","You've doubtless heard Alexis Lafreniere's name roll off the tip of every scout and hockey analyst's tongue at one point or another for nearly half a decade. He's that type of talent. 
This season was hardly the last step of a saunter from Saint-Eustache, Quebec to the top spot on the 2020 NHL Draft's podium though. 
The concerns that many scouts held about Lafreniere's skating, widely panned as below the NHL average, represented a crack in the armour ripe for another top prospect to exploit. ""I think a lot of people are going to chaIlenge Lafreniere for No. 1 overall,"" one scout told me at the Hlinka Gretzky Cup. ""His feet are a problem."" 
Correction: his feet were a problem. They're now just a cut above average, as expressed by the 5.5 grade that our OMJHL scout  meted to Lafreniere. 
Everything else? Well, you can read the player's grades, and they're all at or near the top of the chart. 
It should come as no surprise then that the same is true of Lafreniere's standing among the players accounted for in our Dir. of North American Scouting 's tracking project. The SEAL adjusted scoring metric that Jeremy Davis crafted rates Lafreniere as the second-most prolific scorer in his draft class; his draft-season carries a 100 percent XLS rating, too . ","Lafreniere has been the consensus number one prospect for this draft for two years now. This season, he has shown even more so why this is the case. Lafreniere has elite skill and hockey sense. He also uses his frame well to protect the puck and create offense. Whether dominating play down low or great offense off the rush, Lafreniere boasts a strong tool kit that will land him in the NHL immediately next season. He was the MVP at the World Juniors. Lafreniere has no glaring weaknesses in his game and will help the team that drafts him immediately. He appears to be a genuine NHL star with elite potential.","A smart and versatile forward, he has earned many accolades going into the draft as an offensive juggernaut and rightly so. Though his skating hasn't been celebrated as much as his other skills his acceleration and first steps need to improve he has a powerful stride that gives him an above average speed. He has some strong edges and a great upper-body strength that help him protect his puck effectively. He is easily the smartest player one the ice amongst his peers and he thinks the game quicker and better than anybody. Although he loves to make simple passes to keep possession of the puck, he's very creative. His offensive awareness, instincts, anticipation, decision-making, creativity and poise are all elite. He always has his head on a swivel, and he spots open players with such ease. He loves to feed his linemates in the slot and he's able to find perfect passing lanes despite multiple stick and skates. Slick hands and a quick release on his shot, he is a dangerous combination of goal scorer and playmaker. Offensively, he continually showcases his tools and the potential to be a franchise player. The only knock on his game is defensively, he needs to improve his compete level and work harder at protecting his own zone. Overall, he is very confident and poised with the puck, and no matter how much pressure is under, he stays calm and collected to make the best play possible. It's no secret he has endless potential and is already physically mature enough for the NHL and will undoubtedly be there next season."
2020,C,76,215,2,LAK,2,Quinton Byfield,"Byfield had an incredible 17-year-old season in the OHL, as one of the best players in the modern era at that age in that league. He's an exciting and very well-rounded player. He's 6-foot-4, he's a very good skater for such a large player and his hands are right up there with the best in the draft. He can break a shift open with his ability to power past or dangle through defenders. His creativity is great, and his large wingspan combined with his elite hands allows him to stickhandle around defenders with ease. Byfield's playmaking has been an area I've questioned – and some scouts do as well – but this season he's shown high-level vision. It's not the greatest, but it's very good and he'll be able to make NHL caliber plays. His shot is also very good, and he can score from the dots. Byfield is a very competitive player who uses his large frame to power his way to chances and win battles along the walls. He projects as an all-situations center. When the pace increased at the higher levels on the international stage, like the Hlinka Gretzky or the world juniors, he faded a bit, but I remain a huge believer because of his toolkit and his performance with his club team. He looks like a foundational No. 1 center in the NHL.","Some scouts soured on Byfield in the second half. I was not one of them. I would chalk up most of that distaste to the creeping effects of overexposure. When a top prospect has been on the scene for years like Byfield has, there's a tendency to begin to look for things to nitpick in their games. For a while, Lafreniere's skating was one such so-called concern. With Byfield, the combination of his unremarkable world juniors, his at-times mediocre defensive play and the strength of the rest of the draft resulted in debates about whether he should be the No. 2 pick.

On one hand, some of those concerns have at least some merit. Lucas Raymond, Alexander Holtz, Tim Stutzle and even Lukas Reichel and John-Jason Peterka all had more of an impact at the world juniors than Byfield did. Meanwhile, his defensive play has never been a highlight of his game, and despite winning more than 50 percent of his faceoffs this year, it's an admitted area of his game that he wants to work on — and that Sudbury staff want him to work on. On the other hand, the list of things I care about when evaluating Byfield has defensive acumen and world junior performance as a 17-year-old in limited minutes somewhere near the bottom. He's huge, his skating has become enough of a strength that he can really push the pace through the middle of the ice, he's got excellent puck skill for a player his size and he's surprisingly creative for his size. He's also one of the younger players in the draft, so he's got time to figure out the rest. Byfield plays the sport's most coveted position, doesn't turn 18 until the end of August and paced for 124 points across a 68-game OHL season.","The first thing you'll notice with Byfield is that he can be physically dominant when he needs to.
Byfield's goals often come in close proximity, either just around the crease or below the hash marks. Byfield uses his strength to hold his own around the net and create havoc in front of the goalie, but a big reason as to why he's so successful in close is because of how he uses his skating to his advantage. Byfield's shot has never been a top aspect of his overall game, but we're still talking about a player who was on pace for nearly 50 goals this season. Byfield didn't have the final explosive numbers that Lafreniere had this season, but the underlying stats suggest Byfield is far ahead of the curve. Defensively, Byfield's strong skating allows him to get back into the battle and he has the reach to poke the puck out of danger. He isn't afraid to block shots, but his confidence in his own game and his determination to help his teammates out is special.","Byfield looked like he was seriously going to give Lafreniere a run for his money at No. 1, but his game-to-game consistency wasn't at the same level. Byfield's game was a little uneven from midseason on, and I wonder whether the draft season began to wear on him. He is one of the younger players in this draft class but was fifth in the OHL in terms of points per game (1.82). At his best, he is a dominant force with elite-level speed, especially considering his size. He thinks the game extremely well, with good vision and a playmaker's touch. Byfield's defensive game needs maturation, but his instincts with the puck are very strong. If everything goes right in his development, he has a chance to be special.","Quinton Byfield is one of the youngest players in this class, and he's already one of its most physically advanced centres. He'll need to refine certain elements of his offensive approach to maximize his potential but we like his odds of getting there. When he does, you're talking about a No. 1 centre that can play in any situation.","Being a scout is equal parts accounting for what's already there and projecting where it's headed. In Sudbury Wolves centre Quinton Byfield, there's more than enough to line either side of the ledger. 
That's the reason why many pegged Byfield as the prospect most likely to supplant Alexis Lafreniere at first overall. Even if he's not there yet, the combination of size, speed, power, and skill present in Byfield's game offers the best chance of surpassing him at some point down the road. 
Since the comparison has proven inescapable - - the considerable difference in age between the two warrants our attention. Byfield is less than a month away from qualifying for the 2021 NHL Draft; Lafreniere conversely is less than a month removed from last year's draft. That's 312 days apart, nearly a full year, for anyone keeping track. 
As such, any comparison of the surface level stats that each amassed should pit Byfield's 
2019-20 season, in which he scored at a 1.82 points per game pace, against Lafreniere's 2018-19 season, in which he hit the 1.72 mark. 
All of a sudden, the two don't seem so far apart. 
How they produce is another matter entirely. It's one area where Byfield couldn't possibly be more distinct from the presumptive first overall pick. 
Where most skaters seek out space; Byfield carries the puck like a power running back in the NFL does a football headlong into traffic. As our OHL scout Rachel Doerrie has rightly noted in her reports; this propensity to play bumper cars rather than darting away like a drag car racer is a double-edged sword. Teams want players who can operate in the most hotly contested parts of the offensive zone, but that's usu a I ly a bonus and not the basis on which they operate. 
Granted, Byfield plays a power forward's game, and this sort of thing comes with the territory to a certain degree. 
He's blessed with a 6-foot-4 frame, an explosive skating stride, and a set of hands so gifted as to make one wonder if there was a career spent shaping sculptures in a previous lifetime. ","Byfield is a special talent and, for most, is the consensus number two prospect in this draft. At just over 6'4″, Byfield boasts a tall, big frame. But, that isn't the only reason why he is ranked so high. Byfield has elite hands and is an excellent skater. He was pretty quiet at the World Juniors. But that isn't a concern for me considering he was a 17-year-old playing limited minutes for the gold medal winner Canada. Byfield's play can be described as “powerful,” and he looks like a game-breaker. He is fun to watch and looks like a top-six center at the NHL level. Due to his physical maturity, he may be in the NHL next season.","A complete power center, he is an offensive juggernaut with big, powerful, explosive strides and impressive speeds. A dual-threat power forward that has the skating ability of a highly skilled forward boasting a heavy shot and strength to protect the puck.  Blessed with a huge frame and excellent athleticism, his skating is far more advanced than most of his opponents and it's tough to slow him down. Uses his reach and wingspan effectively, shielding the puck from opposing players while dominating puck possession in the cycle game. Impressive puck handling ability for a player his size, displays the aggressiveness and ability to handle the puck close to his body and deke defenders out of position. He has a great shot with a deceptive release and heavy power that can catch goalies off-guard with his variety of release points. His playmaking is truly elite and he is easily able to draw opponents to his position and create space not only for himself but his teammates, too.  Possessing an advanced defensive game for his age, he displays zone awareness and puts forward consistent effort in supporting his defensemen below the goal line. Active on the backcheck, he is growing more confident in the defensive zone and should continue to improve. Doesn't shy away from physical play but has room to add a mean streak to take advantage of his size and strength. He has an advanced understanding of the game and his vision is high-level, propelling him into an elite prospect with high potential."
2020,C,73,187,3,OTT,3,Tim Stutzle,"Stutzle was very impressive for a U18 player competing against men, as an important piece of one of the best teams in the German pro league and often leaned on in big moments. Stutzle is a dynamic offensive player who has a lot of NHL caliber components to his game. He's a great skater. His speed is just above-average; his stride can look a bit sloppy in a straight line but he can challenge with speed. His edgework is elite, which is why he gets a high skating grade. He is fantastic at spinning off pressure and evading checks with his edges. Stutzle also has great hands. His ability to play high-end skill plays at quick speeds has made him so successful as a pro and distinguishes him as a prospect. He's a very good passer who makes tough plays on the move, like with his stick handling. This gives him a game with a ton of pace and should allow him to be an impactful NHL forward. Stutzle's not very physical, but he has a great compete level, often using his quickness to hunt down pucks. Even versus much bigger players in the DEL he won a surprising number of battles. Stutzle is officially listed as a winger, but he's played center before, such as at the U18 worlds B pool as an underage where he won 58 percent of his draws, and he says he feels comfortable playing center.","Stutzle is the quickest player in the draft through his acceleration, and maybe at his top speed too. He's also in competition with Jamie Drysdale for having the lightest stride in the class. He looks like he's floating out there and his feet never drag through his crossovers or his pushes. It makes him a threat to make something happen out of a foot race or to burn a defender in transition. He can also play at different tempos, which is a huge asset for a player with that kind of skating ability. Some players who can burn north-south really struggle to slow down the game and put themselves in bad spots with the puck as a result. Stutzle isn't one of those players because he can turn a full-speed rush into a quick cut or have the wherewithal to pull up and hit a secondary option. He's also deceptively strong on his stick and skates. My one concern with his game is his willingness to get to the front of the net to score. He's got an accurate shot and the hands needed to beat goalies in tight, but he could stand to go there more consistently. After an illness sidelined him near the end of the world juniors, he also faded a little in the second half of the season, which was evident in his play and his production down the stretch. His transition game remains the most dynamic in the class. The thing about this draft class is that whoever landed at No. 7 or No. 8 on my board was going to feel like a disservice. If I'm drafting third overall, he's in the conversation. I won't be too fussed about the actual picks on draft day if my top eight are the top eight picks off the board, in whatever order that is. It's going to come down to preference.","Stutzle's ability to adapt his game against his nation's top domestic league players is a sign that he shouldn't have an issue adapting to playing against men. Part of that is because Stutzle's high-attack speed and ability to transition at an impressive rate of velocity allows him to keep up with the action and dictate where the puck will end up next. Some scouts consider Stutzle to be the best skater in the draft, and it's his ability to take away space and create his own with his footwork that makes him so elusive.

Stutzle needs to use his speed to his advantage because while he has the skill level to handle himself effectively, his strength lacks compared to the likes of other top prospects such as Quinton Byfield or Anton Lundell.
Depending on which scout you talk to, Stutzle's playmaking ability is the best aspect of his game. Ideally, scouts would have liked to see more than seven goals in the DEL this season (and just 11 if you include international outings), but his shot is far from a concern. Back in his own zone, Stutzle always seems to be engaged in the defensive side of the game and his speed allows him to catch opponents off guard on a reverse rush. There's still room for improvement, though. Teams love prospects with confidence, and “cocky” is definitely a word that can be used to describe Stutzle's game – but in a good way.","There is a sense of ease in Stutzle's game, a level of poise that is not easily attained for a teenager in his first season of pro hockey. He has high-end puckhandling and skating abilities along with elite vision and hockey sense. He has a nice release and good shot, but I think his hands work best when he's snapping passes, especially down low. He uses the ice that's given to him and often makes the play, but he doesn't force things. Stutzle has a chance to become part of a growing elite class of German hockey players, and he's done it without ever really leaving home. But he likely will need to get into an AHL lineup to grow and learn the North American game.","If you want a gifted goal-scorer with dynamic puck skills and a blazing fast skating stride, then Tim Stutzle is your guy. He's raw, but the skill is there. Whichever team drafts Stutzle is going to have to work some nasty habits out of his game, but the package of skills makes it more than worth the trouble.","It's hard to imagine that anyone saw their stock rise more steadily than Adler Mannheim forward Tim Stutzle did this season, rising from a mid-to-late first-round candidate to a lock for the 
top-five, potentially even the top-three when the draft goes down in October. 
If only we'd offered consolidated draft rankings at the start of the season. It sure would be nice to have the numbers to back up what seems obvious by intuition. 
Granted, we're a bit lower than the rest of the industry on Stutzle. We ranked him as the No. 7 prospect in this year's draft on our first board in December, and he's bounced between that spot and No. 8 overall right to the last. 
One can't help but laugh at the bizarre twist of fate which has us lower on Stutzle than industry consensus after starting the year without much company in his corner. 
Ain't that something? 
I'd caution against reading too much into that though. This has a lot more to do with 
canyon-clearing bounds in development from other players in the top-five or top-ten than it does any stagnation on Stutzle's part. 
He took some major strides in his own right, going from a player with a deathly fear of the centre lane of the offensive zone to one wiling to take the puck to those parts of the ice consistently near the end of the season. 
Should he continue to commit himself to that part of the game, there's no telling what sort of damage he'll be able to do in the NHL. His skill level is off the charts good. It's still a bit of a work in progress. Stutzle often peels away from the centre lane before pressure has even arrived, and that's going to need fixing. 
He's a dextrous handler of the puck with plus-value as a puck carrier, capable of transitioning the puck up-ice all by his lonesome at a blistering pace with the grace of a gazelle, and the hands of a renaissance sculptor. 
Here's what Dir. of North American Scouting Mitchell  had to say of Stutzle's pace and handling ability in a player report that he put together towards the end of the DEL season. 
""Incredible control with pace; variety to attack through defenders' triangles and burst through space; adapts grip and reach to changing situations; fights to regain control through traffic and mishandles; adds fakes for misdirection; quickness with soft touch."" 
Where one might quibble with StutzIe's approach though is the propensity to carve his marble slabs into nothingness, 
over-handling the puck on entries until he's lost it entirely. Sometimes discretion really is the better part of valour, and it's a lesson that Stutzle is very much in the process of learning. 
""He always looks to stickhandle through traffic rather than use passing triangles and creating advantages; sets up dekes with a wide glide and stick in front -- easy to dispossess with a limited speed advantage (instead of attacking with a series of crossover and/or opening up hips into a heel-to-heel); drops head to make an extra dangle instead of pass."" 
Some players problem-solve against primary, secondary, tertiary, etc. variables; Stutzle troubleshoots. To quote TSN's Dir. of Scouting Craig Button ""Stutzle takes the game by the throat."" He's not looking to advance play through a deceptive hook or slip pass; he's hoping to maneuver through numbers, and to quote the venerable Han Solo, with ""never tell me the odds"" mentality. 
There isn't much that Stutzle can't do as a passer either. He'll work from range, through traffic, through layers, and whether there's pressure or space - - he's getting that puck to his teammate. He's a technically gifted distributor of the puck with elite vision when he slows the game down a bit, particularly when he sets up shop on the left half-wall on the man advantage. 
Given his natural handling ability, playmaking prowess, high-end hockey sense, and an unrelenting motor; Stutzle profiles, in some ways, as a centre at the NHL level. That was his position prior to joining Adler Mannheim this year in the DEL. We're skeptical, leaning towards a future on the wing at the NHL level. 
We haven't ruled out the possibility of a transition to centre at some point. Take Vancouver Canucks centre Elias Pettersson's arc as one example of a player bucking the odds on that front. He hardly took any shifts at centre in his draft and 
draft-plus-one season. Then he was a top-ten centre in the NHL as a 20-year-old in his draft-plus-two season -- go figure Probability isn't destiny, right? 
Stutzle took a good number of reps at centre at the U20 World Junior Hockey Championship, and there are some in the industry who maintain that this was his best hockey al I season. There is a proof concept. 
Whatever position Stutzle plays, he has 60-70 point upside at the NHL level as a top-line playmaker with significant power play utility. Those players are hard to find. If you can get one in the range we've rated Stutzle in, then you're laughing all the way to the bank. Odds are he'll be gone much sooner though. ","One of my favorite players in this draft, Stutzle plays with a high level of pace, similar to that of the Islanders' Matt Barzal. Playing against men in Germany, Stutzle has looked dominant at times and has kept up every step of the way. He is an elite skater and is excellent at zone entries. Stutzle is creative and looks like a high-end playmaker. He plays with a high level of competitiveness and is tenacious when attacking with the puck. Stutzle can play center or wing, though it is likely most NHL teams would love for him to turn into a top-six center. He may find himself in the NHL next season thanks to his pro experience.","Stutzle has been on the rise all year but the World Juniors have been his coming-out party for the general population.  He generates impressive speed with every stride and can seemingly take the puck from the defensive zone to the offensive zone at will. His skating is on such a high level that he can make mistakes because he is able to catch up and make up for them. He has excellent puck skills, stick-handling his way through the neutral zone, attacking stagnant defenders with his elite speed and edgework and putting defenders on their heels. He has a lightning-quick release and a heavy shot that jumps off his stick. His passing is near the top of the class as well. He can thread the needle with the best of them. An offensive dynamo, he plays like a shark on the hunt when he doesn't have the puck on his stick, constantly flowing in and out of traffic, getting to the slot and driving the lane with ease. He provides an outlet for his defensemen by circling high in the offensive zone when the puck is at the point. He is defensively responsible and covers the defensive zone like a center, which he has some experience playing. He is generally the first forward back, even when he seems most out of the play and he does a good job of getting his stick in on the puck, disrupting passes and shots regularly. Overall, he plays with joy and loves creating scoring chances."
2020,LW,71,170,4,DET,4,Lucas Raymond,"Raymond didn't have a great season, mostly due to the limited role he played on a high scoring Frolunda team, where he averaged less than 10 minutes of ice time but did get some power play time. He looked very good at the U20 level and in brief deployment at the junior level in Sweden, but he didn't blow doors down this season. He remains a top prospect because of his incredible talent, hockey sense and his performance when he played versus his peers. As an underage he dominated Sweden's junior league as a 16-year-old and helped carry Sweden's U18 team to a gold medal. With the puck on his stick he's incredibly dangerous. His hands are elite and his ability to beat defenders 1-on-1 clean in ways unlike other players can create a lot of highlight reel moments. He will be a true PP1 quarterback in the NHL because of the unique plays he can make. He has a unique way of navigating with the puck in the offensive zone, showing the patience and vision of a top NHL playmaker in how he picks apart defenses and find seams. Raymond isn't the biggest guy and isn't a guy you will tab to kill penalties, but he competes well and gets to the net. While he's more of a passer, he does have a good shot when he looks to shoot. My one concern is his just average footspeed, particularly as a 5-foot-10 forward. He has good edgework and a powerful first step, with a wide stance he employs when trying to protect pucks but lacks an NHL caliber separation gear.","Though Raymond never quite got his game to the same level as the other top-ranked draft prospects this year, his blend of puck-hunting when he doesn't have it and crafty playmaking when he does make him a truly unique player in this class. Raymond is a fearless puck carrier who can pick apart teams in the offensive zone at even strength with a quick stutter or a surprising pass or run a power play as the primary entry option and quarterback. He still needs to add some strength, which will improve on his mid-level straightaway speed (his footwork is already high-end) and the threat of his shot (his release is deceptive as is), but the rest is there. And while he may be a little further away from his NHL peak than some of his peers, the long-term payoff may also surpass them.","When you watch Raymond closely, you see just how remarkable he is in every zone. In the offensive zone, he is constantly applying pressure and forechecking. When Raymond is in the neutral zone with the puck, you can expect him to glide up the ice in transition. If he does not have the puck in the neutral zone, Raymond is pressing up against the attacker and blocking his opponent from completing a zone entry. In the defensive zone, Raymond might not apply as much pressure, but his is hovering all over the ice surface and constantly uses his frame to press up against his opponents mid-cycle.","Raymond has been one of the hardest players to evaluate in this class because he is too good for Sweden's junior league but not quite good enough to play an elevated role on a perennial SHL powerhouse laden with veteran talent. He averaged under 10 minutes of ice time in 33 SHL games and was either healthy-scratched or played as the extra forward an awful lot this season. He had 14 points in nine games in Sweden's under-20 league, as well. His one-on-one skills, skating and willingness to battle for his ice are plus traits.","There might not be a more complete winger in this year's draft than Lucas Raymond. He plays such a mature brand of hockey for someone so young. Some have cooled on Raymond as a result of lacklustre scoring totals this year in the SHL, but almost all of that can be attributed to a lack of opportunities as a result of playing on one of the SHL's strongest sides in FrOlunda.","The first tier of players in this year's draft is three skaters long, and it ends with Frolunda winger Lucas Raymond. That's where he started the season, and that's where he'I I finish it. 
That might strike some as bold based on Raymond's surface-level data from a season spent primarily on Frolunda's men's team in the SHL. The 10 points to Raymond's credit through 33 games hardly jump off the page. 
As always, context is king. Raymond played fourth-line minutes with fourth-line support pieces and only featured sparingly on the second power play unit. Good luck finding an under-20 skater that's going to perform much better under those circumstances. 
At the very least, it's a much more hostile setting than the CHL, where Alexis Lafreniere and Quinton Byfield. When the three lined up at the U20 World Hockey Championships in December and January, Raymond's quality revealed itself. His 0.57 point per game clip is well ahead of Byfield (0.14 ), even if Lafreniere's two points per game rate dwarfs both their marks. 
It's last year's performance at the U18 that established Raymond's legend. The eight points Raymond amassed through seven games were the second-most on Sweden, a hat-trick --including the overtime goal -- in the Gold Medal Game among them. Those eight points were second only to Russia's Rod ion Amirov among draft-minus-one skaters. 
Simply put: Raymond is the most complete winger in this year's draft. There isn't anything he can't do. 
Raymond's skating is the matter of some debate in the public and private sphere alike. Nobody seems to rate it as bad, per se, but some would have you believe it's barely above average if that. Don't count us among them. 
When one puts the puck on Raymond's stick, his two-step explosiveness sees him shoot up the ice as if sent from a cannon. He's a mechanically refined skater, generating straight-line speed with ease, and combining it with lateral quickness and potent weight shifts to skate through and around opponents depending on what the situation calls for. 
Here's where Raymond really builds separation, if you'll pardon the pun. Where most elite skaters this age only have it in them to play at their top speed; Raymond changes the tempo and pace to create space for himself as a puck-carrier gaining the zone. 
It took others years in the NHL to figure this out. Raymond's already got it under control. 
The icing on the cake? Raymond can handle at his top speed, can shoot through his top speed, and he can distribute the puck at his top speed. One might count the number of players in this draft that can perform any one of those tasks at their top speed on one hand. 
There's a great harmony between Raymond's hands, feet, and even his brain. We've seen him consistently problem-solve against complex defensive arrangements, often working through secondary and tertiary variables in such a way as to advance play, sometimes creating scoring chances out of seeming dead-end situations. 
He's more of a playmaker than a finisher. Raymond brings an above-average shot and can finish from short-to-intermediate ranges. He's also the type of puckhandler that can thrive in small ice scenarios, so there's never much impetus to take low percentage shots -- the data backs this up, too. 
He'll drive play. He'll drive percentages. He has the potential to be the offensive engine of whichever line hosts him for the majority of his NHL career. 
In terms of what he'll need to do to hit his ceiling and improve as a player; our Dir. of European Scouting Christoffer Hedlund believes that Raymond will need to play an increased role with Frolunda next season. Added time in the gym won't hurt either. 
Even so, Hedlund rates Raymond as carrying top-line potential as an elite two-way winger. The risk factor is relatively low with Raymond. One can comfortably invest a high pick in this type of player and not lose sleep. 
Whether that'll happen or not remains to be seen. Raymond's taken a bit of heat this year for seemingly low boxcar stats and a lack of overwhelming, obvious skill. 
One has to split hairs this high in the draft. I get it. 
Whichever team drafts Raymond though is going to be so much better for it. The mature brand of hockey that this 
18-year-old Swede brings to the table means that they won't have to wait long to see that pay off in their NHL lineup either.as if sent from a cannon. He's a mechanically refined skater, generating straight-line speed with ease, and combining it with lateral quickness and potent weight shifts to skate through and around opponents depending on what the situation calls for. 
Here's where Raymond really builds separation, if you'll pardon the pun. Where most elite skaters","Raymond has been a tough player for me to evaluate this season. Back in November, I had him pegged as a potential top-three candidate, but he has since dropped in my evaluations. I do still think he will be an excellent NHL player, however. Raymond falls into a category of “hard to evaluate” at times because he is playing against men in Sweden. Because of this, he hasn't put up great offensive numbers and it's hard to determine his offensive ceiling. However, he is also a player I have been able to observe more frequently recently.  He has excelled offensively at the beginning of the season and any question surrounding his offensive ability has been answered for me.  

Raymond has shown flashes of the brilliance that had him in my top three to start the season. He is exceptionally dangerous off the rush and is extremely creative. The biggest red flag for him has been he has been able to do this against his peers, but not with success against older players. Raymond is young, but he will likely need some extra development time to help his overall confidence and ability to transition his tool kit to a higher level. He is arguably the best one-on-one player in the draft.","Raymond is an elite offensive talent that has the right hockey IQ to play a strong two-way game. He is a very high-end skater that excels in all areas of skating from having the ability to make short, quick cuts to possessing a top speed that blows most out of the water and terrific edges that he uses to elude defenders offensively. He has a fantastic speed and agility combined with a great puck handling and creativity, which makes it hard for defenders to keep up with him. A high-motor player who keeps his feet moving in every situation and capitalizes on his elite hockey sense and skating in all situations. His shot is very good, as he locates it well and he gets it off quickly. The power behind his shot is sometimes inconsistent but that should be improved with added strength as he physically matures. His passing ability is crisp and accurate. He can make virtually any pass in the offensive zone, filtering the puck towards the net in the process. His defensive game is predicated on being aggressive and getting his stick into passing and shooting lanes and he excels at taking the puck away with stick lifts and closing out players on loose pucks. He isn't an overly physical player, but he doesn't shy away from contact in the corners. With some added size, he should be able to win more board battles than he already does because of his stick-skills. With his hockey sense and offensive skills, he ticks all the boxes."
2020,C,69,183,9,MIN,5,Marco Rossi,"Rossi dominated the OHL this season, scoring more than two points per game as one of the best players in the entire CHL. He was a major reason why the 67's were an elite team. Rossi is an exciting player due to his skill and IQ. He has tremendous stick handling ability in tight areas and can slide off checks. He's a great passer with a high level of offensive creativity who projects to play the half-wall on an NHL power play. Rossi's skating is good, but he's more of a skill player than a speedy player. He's not the quickest small player you'll ever see, but he has a powerful stride and good edge work to elude checks. While Rossi is undersized, he's a very competitive player. He drives the net consistently, he can kill penalties very well and he can be used in tough defensive situations. His great skill and production are very appealing. He doesn't raise to the top tier of the draft due to his size and speed combination, but he projects to be a top-line NHL forward because of how smart, skilled and competitive he is.","Rossi isn't far off from my idea of a perfect hockey player. He can break teams down through seams, he can beat defenders one-on-one both off the cycle and the rush. He can score with his release or his hands and footwork. He plays in the middle of the ice but knows when to take the outside lane. And he's the best defensive forward in the draft. Some evaluators point to his height and question whether he'll stick at centre. Others question his late birthday and dominant team for the effect they had on his remarkable production. And while the latter has some effect on my evaluation, the former is lazy and doesn't account for how strong he is or the way his low centre of gravity in his stance helps him fight off bigger defenders. He's also one of the most determined, focused prospects I've ever interacted with and is probably the most NHL-ready player in the draft after Lafreniere, so the team that selects him is getting an impact player from Day 1.","There's no shortage of talented, two-way centermen in the draft this year, so what sets Rossi above the rest? Other than the numbers, which proves he's too good for the junior level at this point, Rossi is good at just about everything asked of him. Special teams? Check. Offensive awareness? Check. Defensive reliability? Check. Creativity? Definitely check. If he had Quinton Byfield's 6-foot-4 frame, we'd be talking about a serious threat for the No. 2 pick in Rossi.","Rossi has become oddly polarizing. His 2.14 points per game in the OHL ranks fifth among players 18 years old or younger over the past 20 years, but many have rushed to underplay that production because of the quality of his team and the relative weakness of the OHL's Eastern Conference. There also are concerns about Rossi's size. But the power and strength he generates from his lower half alleviates those size concerns for me, and no matter how you reason, he knows how to score. Rossi is good in small areas, engages with defenders and can protect the puck fairly well. No, his skating doesn't blow you away, but he's good on his edges and uses high-end hockey sense to make plays under pressure. Plus, Rossi's hand skills are excellent, and there's a little tenacity in his game.","There aren't many 5-foot-9 centres in the NHL, but Marco Rossi endeavours to buck the trend. He's a fearless puck-carrier, deploying a wide base and small ice shiftiness to create offence from the most hotly contested parts of the offensive zone. A gifted one-touch passer, Rossi makes everyone around him better. Whether Rossi is a centre or winger — he's going to do damage in the NHL.","It's not the size of the dog in the fight but the size of the fight in the dog. Ottawa 67s centre Marco Rossi is the skating, breathing embodiment of that timeless adage. 
The vertical limitations that come with a 5-foot-9 frame don't represent the end of the list of barriers Rossi had to clear. 
Born in Feldkirch, Austria, this supremely talented pivot lapped what little competition the 
non-traditional hockey market had to offer. Perhaps ironically, he was too big a fish in far too small a pond. 
So, Rossi departed from Austria and competition that was five and sometimes six years his senior for Switzerland, where he played against players four years his senior. His father Michael would drive him to and from the rink, sometimes a three-hour drive. 
Eventually, Rossi was facing off against men in the Swiss second-tier league, the NLB. That is until the Ottawa 67s invested the 18th pick in the first round of the 2018 CHL Import Draft. 
Since then, Rossi has lit the OHL on fire, scoring at a torrid 1.70 point per game pace for the 67s. He's done it a number of different ways, posturing as a dual-threat scorer with a statistical split to match -- 68 goals to 117 assists, for those keeping track. 
Where Rossi's future lies in the NHL is as a distributor though. Expect the assists to come more readily than goals for Rossi in the big leagues. That's where his future lies. 
Everything one might want in an elite NHL playmaker is already there in abundance in Rossi's game. He's a player with an exceptional sense of spacing both on and off the puck, capable of playing in the most sensitive portions of the offensive zone and suffering hardly any physical wear for the trouble. 
On the rare occasions that a defender gets within striking distance of Rossi, he'll widen his stance, get low and leverage himself against his opponents like a chair against a door handle. 
He's a bit of a riverboat gambler with the puck on his stick, goading the opposition into close quarters only to find his teammates with a tape-to-tape pass in the prime position that they'd just vacated. 
He'll distribute east-to-west, low-to-high, through levels -- you name it. If there's an opening, then Rossi is going to find it and ruthlessly exploit it. If the defence takes away one option, Rossi is ready to deploy a hook or slip pass, something against the grain, or highly creative feeds on the backhand or forehand to work through it. 
The shot map that our partners at lnStat Hockey produced offers a valuable bit of insight into the positions from which Rossi is most effective. The vast majority of his shots and goals come from the homeplate area that is commonly used as a proxy for scoring chances; he's particularly adept from the left side of the net-front . Granted, this also reveals some of the limitations to Rossi's game. Particularly, the lack of intermediate-to-long range finishing ability. It's one of the many reasons that Rossi projects so unidimensionally at the next level; his shot simply isn't where it needs to be to beat NHL goaltenders on a regular basis. 
While Rossi's skating rates as above the NHL average, it's not the engine of his offensive output. It's a bonus that grants him value through the neutral zone as a puck-carrier and the ability to backcheck and track with aplomb. 
To quote our OHL regional scout Rachel Doerrie, ""Marco Rossi is one of the most unique players in this draft."" 
Whether this pint-sized Austrian has it in him to play centre at the NHL level is the only real question one might reasonably harbour about his long-term projection. There aren't many 5-foot-9 pivots, even in an increasingly progressive league. That's more or less where the questions end though. 
He's not going to win the Selke Trophy, but Rossi is a capable defensive player with great off the puck positioning who dutifully supports his defencemen below the hashmarks. The offensive gifts are overwhelming, as best evidenced by Rossi's CHL-leading 120 points last season. That's spectacular, even when one accounts for the fact that he's a September birthdate. ","Rossi is a small-skilled forward and one of the older players available in this draft, which may explain some of his high point totals. Regardless of this, however, Rossi has shown an elite skill set and ability to put up points in the OHL this season, leading the league as a whole. Small and skilled, Rossi uses his strong skating and edge work to create offense. He is highly competitive and tenacious on the forecheck and with the puck. Rossi is everything you want in a player in the early first round of the draft. He looks like a top-six center with #1 center potential.","Rossi is a multitalented forward who plays well above his age and his quick first step and high-speed plays make him lightning fast on his feet and full of potential to be an offensive dynamo at the next level.  A quick release on his accurate shot and polished passing ability make him a legit threat every time he takes to the ice. He is at his most dangerous when he is in the slot, though he could be more consistent on finishing plays.  He possesses a play driving, game changing scoring threat type of skill that makes him an exciting player to watch. Quick starts and stops allow him to juke and jive, making him evasive through traffic and gain speed as he navigates through the neutral zone using his high-end vision to find open ice. One area to improve is his ability to maintain puck possession through traffic and one way he may be able to do that is by bulking up for next year. One thing that stands out about him are his habits; he doesn't take a shift off, competes extremely hard no matter what zone he's in and is continuously in the right position and doing the right things to help his team be successful. This is evident with his play in the defensive zone, getting deep into the zone and aggressively attacking his opponents as he gets physical and pins players to the boards, but can also finesse the puck from them with a smooth stick lift."
2020,D,71,183,8,ANA,6,Jamie Drysdale,"Drysdale was one of the top defensemen in the OHL and accomplished the unusual feat of not only making Canada's U20 team as a 17-year-old, but also holding his own and showing he could skate with that team. He's one of the best skaters in the draft. He has very good speed and can lead a rush at the higher level. His speed isn't what defines his skating, though, it's his elite edge work. He's so good at evading pressure, and walking the blue line with his crossovers and spinning off checks. Even though he's not the biggest defenseman, Drysdale shuts down a lot of rushes because of how quickly he closes on his checks. Offensively he's very good, but not flashy. He's not going to go end to end through three defenders, but he's an excellent puck-mover. He sees the ice at a very high level, and is creative with his exits and blue line play. His elite skating and vision are what make him dangerous and will allow him to QB an NHL power play.","Drysdale is the best defenceman in the draft and will surely not be available at eighth overall as a result. I wouldn't fault a team for taking him as high as third, either. His lower ranking here has more to do with the impact I believe the forwards ahead of him could — and should — have at the NHL level than it does with any concerns I have about Drysdale's game. He's one of the more effortless skaters the draft has produced in recent memory, with top-tier four-way mobility that helps him close gaps, pivot away from pressure, weave through traffic, play on his heels when he has to and create lanes for his passes or shots. His hands and heads-up vision also help him navigate in all three zones with the puck, run a power play and hit seams when they open up. And though he lacks power, both in his man-on-man defending and in his shot, he's still polished without the puck and does a great job disrupting plays with his stick and making quick decisions to move the puck back up ice. His lack of size and strength may limit him from becoming a Norris Trophy-calibre defender but he's got other dynamic qualities that may help him become a No. 1 (if not a very good No. 2) anyway.",,"Drysdale is an effortless, deceptive skater who can make a lot of plays with his feet in terms of opening up ice. His defending is adequate, though he still needs to get stronger and have a more consistent detail in his own end. He was good enough to make Canada's U20 team as an underager and has excellent offensive tools, with a quick shot and confident puck-moving capabilities. I think there's game-breaker potential in Drysdale, but his game needs refining.","We wanted to see so much more from Jamie Drysdale this season. He set the bar so damn high with last year's 40-point performance as a rookie on an undermanned Otters side. Even so, Drysdale produced more offence in fewer games and looked the part as a part of Canada's blue line at the World Junior Hockey Championships. Drysdale has the potential to develop into a No. 1 defenceman with serious offensive upside at the NHL level. That's good enough for fifth overall.","Erie Otters defenceman Jamie Drysdale could've reasonably laid claim to a spot in the top-five of last year's draft on the strength of his rookie season alone. 
It's not often a 17-year-old steps into the OHL and puts up 40 points in 63 games playing tough minutes on one of the league's weakest teams. That'll get people's attention. 
The scouting community couldn't wait to see what Drysdale had planned for an encore. 
He picked up right where he left off too, leading Canada's blue line as the team captured Silver at the Hlinka-Gretzky Cup in Czechia. The 17 points (five goals and 12 assists) Drysdale amassed through the first 12 games of the OHL season only added an exclamation mark to the ""I'm back"" statement sent in August. 
Suddenly, I'm talking to scouts who are saying without a moment's hesitation that they'd rather have Drysdale as currently constructed than last year's first defenceman off the board, Vancouver Giants rearguard Bowen Byram. 
I was a believer, too. How could one not be? Had Drysdale maintained that pace to the end of the season, he would've matched Ryan Ellis' 89 points as the highest output among a first-time draft-eligible defenceman since 1990. 
Things changed. Drysdale stopped scoring, and that was just symptomatic of a trend that saw him seemingly take his foot off the gas in every facet of his game 
Something about wearing his country's colours brings out the best in Drysdale, though, and his second go in Canadian red, this time at the U20 World Hockey Championships reignited the fire from his early-season form. He played a depth role for the most part, but when a combination of illness and injury took Byram out of the semifinals, he filled in admirably and looked the part. 
The World Juniors may be a 19-year-old's tournament, but Drysdale clearly didn't get the memo. 
The foundation of Drysdale's game is his skating. He effortlessly carries the puck up-ice with mechanical grace, and his four-way mobility allows him to shimmy through forecheckers unabated. He's in the top quartile as a puck-carrier generating entries and exits at 5-on-5 based on the sample of CHL and USHL data that Dir. of North American Scouting  collected from the 2019-20 season. Because he's able to maintain three-point flexion through his stride; Drysdale's always got his head up, ready to pass the puck on a moment's notice as opportunities present themselves. 
Where one might quibble with Drysdale's approach through the first two-thirds of the ice is the deference with which he approaches openings that one with his skill set should readily exploit. Whether it's a crisis of confidence or just plain indifference, it's something worth addressing as part of his development plan. 
To quote one report from , ""he doesn't seem to know he is by far the best skater on the ice."" Presently. Drysdale's skating seems more of a corrective tool than a cudgel to wield against his opponents. 
Something seems to click as soon as he enters the offensive zone though - - deference turns to horrifying precision. Drysdale is a deceptive operator from the offensive blue line, baiting forwards with false signals through his shoulders and transferring his weight in the opposite direction to attack the newly vacated space. 
He's more of a playmaker than a shooter, but Drysdale's adaptable first and foremost. He's going to make the best decision regardless of any preference for one type of play rather than the other. 
Since Drysdale is a defenceman, it only makes sense that we broach his play from, well, the defensive third. It's an area of weakness relative to the other parts of his game. His work rate is suspect, and he's not an especially active on the puck defender, opting rather to contain his opponent than to and dispossess him of the puck. 
These are minor quibbles, but minor quibbles matter this high in the draft. Ultimately, Drysdale isgoing to defend by helping his team maintain possession of the puck. The best defence is a good offence, right? He's a brilliant skater, capable of quarterbacking a power play with ease and generating results both ways through the neutral zone. He's the only defenceman in this year's draft with clearn no. 1 defenceman upside","The 2020 draft is light on defense, but that shouldn't impact Drysdale's position in the top ten this year. Drysdale is one of the best skaters in the draft, regardless of position. He also didn't look out of place for Canada at the World Juniors and showcased his ability and willingness to carry the puck into the offensive zone. Some scouts believe he isn't going to be a rush-type defender, but I see the potential based upon his skill set alone. Overall, Drysdale's game is well-rounded, has an excellent first pass, and is solid enough defensively. If everything comes together, he could be a first pairing defender, though he is likely a few years away from NHL duty.","Drysdale is the whole package of an offensive defender. His skating is fast and his edgework is clean, allowing him to skate up and down the ice with solid speed both forwards and backwards. Possesses elite skating ability with great balance on his edges and good agility in tight spaces. He has quick feet and accelerates very quickly, helping him escape forecheckers easily and transition the play out of his own end effectively. His edgework makes him near impossible to pin down and allows him to make a few quick steps before sending a nice pass to open ice. On the defensive side of the puck, he uses his tools to regain possession and keep opponents to the outside. While his size prevents him from being able to physically separate opponents from the puck, his speed and smarts more than make up for it and he displays good zone awareness, keeping forwards to the outside with an active stick and directing teammates to apply pressure on opponents. Could stand to get stronger to increase his effectiveness in net-front and board battles. Great offensive instincts, showing awareness when to jump into the rush and when to make a stretch outlet pass to set up a good scoring chance. His shot is solid, with a quick release and no hesitation to let it go when he has an open shooting lane, though he could beef up to increase his power on shots from the point. His overall game is aided by his elite IQ and vision."
2020,C,70,177,10,WPG,7,Cole Perfetti,"Perfetti burst onto the scene as a U17, scoring the most goals by a player that age since John Tavares, Taylor Hall and Steven Stamkos. Perfetti followed it up with a brilliant U18 season, one of the best in the modern OHL era. He also dominated the Hlinka Gretzky like few others have. Perfetti is incredibly skilled and is one of the best passers in the draft. He is so creative with the puck, finding unique ways to fool defenders, manipulate the puck in tight spaces and make plays through defenders. He can make things happen off the half-wall at an elite level, makes very creative passes frequently, and projects to be a top passer in the NHL due to his vision and his pace. Perfetti isn't the biggest or the quickest forward so some scouts aren't over the moon about him as an undersized forward without NHL speed. I think he skates fine but does lack ability to separate from checks. His compete level is fine, he gets his nose dirty enough and works hard off the puck to get it back. He killed penalties this season and played center for stretches of the season, showing he can be a versatile player, as well.","There's this thing that seems to happen with players who are labelled “smart” where, like those who are labelled as two-way players, their skill level doesn't get the love it deserves. But it doesn't have to be one or the other. Perfetti sees the game differently than everyone else in this class. He sees seams others don't. He recognizes the way opposing defenders are reading the zone before the defenders even recognize what they're seeing in that zone. And the more you watch him, the more so-called concerns of strength or speed begin to fade. He has the indescribable knack for finding pockets of space to get open into (or for giving the puck to a linemate just as he enters into one of them). He's one or two steps ahead of everyone else. Those things shouldn't discount the rest of his tools, though. Because he grades near the top of this draft class as a stickhandler, individual creator and shooter as well. He's also one of the best draft-eligible prospects off the rush that I've seen in recent memory. He doesn't just make everyone else better. He can break open a game too. The reasons for ranking him a few spots lower have always been his skating or his strength. At this point, I'm going to stand by my evaluation.

He can cleanly beat goalies from the slot every other game:

But he will also spin off a defender and set up a goal from his knees","Perfetti scored 37 goals as an OHL rookie, which, at the time, was the most scored by a U-17 player over the past decade before Wright upped the bounty with 39 this season. So, yes, scoring is a major part of Perfetti's game. Perfetti's wrist shot has been among the most dangerous in the entire CHL since his graduation to major junior, and he's no slouch when getting off a slap shot or a one-timer. At this point, I will confidently say that the only players with a more impressive wrist shot in the draft are Alexis Lafreniere (projected No. 1) and Alexander Holtz (potential top five pick), if that tells you anything about Perfetti's hard, lethal snipe. Since Perfetti is so confident with the puck, he's not afraid to let his creative side show. Circling back to the skating front, Perfetti has good footwork and can make plays at a good speed, but his overall skating needs work. He doesn't have a high top speed and will sometimes be caught standing still and watching the action around him. Perfetti's defensive game isn't a standout quality, but it doesn't need to be. Perfetti doesn't have the size to throw a big hit and can be beaten in front of the net by a stronger opponent, but Perfetti, at the very least, can use his smart decision-making to fool the other team's forwards and pick off a pass somewhere in the middle of the zone.
","He can score, he can make plays and his skill is elite. But what I like best about Perfetti are his vision and offensive sense, giving him the ability to pick apart opposing defenses on the rush or in the zone. He can extend plays and seems to always have a plan with the puck on his stick. Perfetti has a pure release on his shot and snaps passes about as well as anyone else in the class. His skating is closer to average, but that is a much bigger problem for players who can't think the game the way Perfetti does.","The second-best finisher in the draft? That's probably Cole Perfetti. He's also one of the draft's premier playmakers. We share worthwhile concerns with the rest of the scouting community about Perfetti's skating and ability to play with pace, but the rest of his game is rock solid.","You want to talk about making a good first impression? Cole Perfetti's record-setting 12 points 
(eight goals and four assists) in five games draped in Canadian colours at the 2020 
Hlinka-Gretzky Cup is about as good as it gets. 
Granted, this wasn't anyone's introduction to Perfetti's legend. It was just the first chapter in the second-book. The first was a real hit. The Saginaw sniper put together a 74-point season in 63 games, and his January birth date isn't early enough to dampen the enthusiasm that sort of year rightly elicits. 
The second chapter was so disorienting a shift as to paint Rian Johnson's cheeks beet red. 
All of the sudden, Perfetti went from a one-shot finisher in the 99th percentile among his 
first-time draft-eligible peers to a credible two-way threat with legitimacy as a playmaker. 
""Perfetti has an underrated playmaking ability,"" our OHL regional scout Rachel Doerrie remarked around November. ""It's started to show up this season."" 
The 18-year-old Spirit centre averaged 0.75 assists per game at that point in the season. Then Perfetti found another gear, finishing the year with 1.21 helpers on a per game basis. 
The underlying data is every bit as impressive. Not only did Perfetti complete the highest percentage of his passes -- on a team that included 2019 first-round pick Ryan Suzuki for the back-half of the year -- but he also led the team with an average of 2.07 passes to the slot, according to the data that our partners at lnStat accumulated over the year. 
If there's a consistent thread that binds every part of Perfetti's game into one cohesive unit: it's his hockey sense. However nebulous a term that may be --and no matter how far one's mileage varies -- Perfetti has it in spades. 
He's a cerebral puck carrier, combining a full quiver's worth of rush patterns with the consistent sense to attack in an arc to create as much space or time as is necessary for himself or his linemates. Some skaters blow by traffic: Perfetti manipulates defenders from his path entirely. 
That he's a remarkably dextrous individual, one capable of blending deception through his passes, be they on the forehand, backhand, slip passes, hook passes, etc. doesn't hurt. His Terminator-esque ability to scan the ice and break down coverages ensure that possession rarely dies on his stick. He'll problem-solve his way through primary, secondary, and even sometimes tertiary variables, advancing play in a threatening posture where most might lose the puck entirely. 
And when Perfetti does advance the puck in these situations, there's two or three defenders stuck to him at a time - - two or three defenders that his linemates don't have to worry about as they accept possession of the puck. That's by design. 
While Alexander Holtz locked up honours as the draft's best finisher; Perfetti is the heir apparent to the title. 
Our scouts haven't seen much deception from Perfetti as a shooter though, which perhaps explains the year-over-year plateauing from his draft-minus-one season to this one at 37 goals -- another explanation is the rule of diminishing returns. He's good enough to take his time and dig with his plant foot before unleashing a precise, powerful wrist shot on goal, and there isn't much that most goaltenders can do to stop him. 
The cerebral component to Perfetti's game as a shooter mostly lies in his sense of timing and spacing. It's one thing to identify pockets of space within the sensitive portions of the offensive zone; it's another entirely to position one's self appropriately and time their charge just right. 
""He's dangerous the second his team is in the offensive zone, because his spatial awareness is so good."" Doerrie remarked in a November report. ""He finds the quiet areas and arrives at the right time for a pass."" 
Now, the speed with which Perfetti so valiantly attacks those openings is another matter entirely. He entered the year a weak skater, and that's right about where he finished it. 
Our scouts have identified a hunched over stance on top of a wide base as the limiting factors to Perfetti's stride. He's just a little bit top heavy. 
Only making matters worse is Perfetti's lack of pace or urgency. He's a nasty tendency of widening his base on entries, pulling a buttonhook maneuver, and gliding around the perimeter for prolonged periods of time with the puck on his stick. It works in the OHL, but a routine that predictable is going to prove costly at the next level. 
It's hard to imagine a scenario where Perfetti is a centre at the NHL level as a result. He's not a great skater, does a lot of his best work from the perimeter, and doesn't offer much support in the defensive zone either. 
If one were to borrow Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll's mantra, the more important question is: What can Cole Perfetti do? He's one of the draft's best finishers, with elite offensive instincts and puck skills to match. There's no reason he can't consistently score 35 goals a season at the peak of his career, and every indication from this season is that he'I I bring a lot as a distributor, too. ","Perfetti began the year looking like a goal-scoring machine. As the season has progressed, he has shown just how well-rounded of a player he is. Perfetti has an excellent release, which he showed at the Ivan Hlinka tournament, and all-season in the OHL he has shown excellent playmaking ability. Some scouts are concerned with his skating, but I believe it is good enough and his tool kit (especially hockey sense) makes up for his foot speed. He looks like a top-six winger at the NHL level.","Perfetti is an explosive skater with great power in his stride and high energy, including quick feet from a stopped position to gain speed quickly and win loose puck races. Sits low in his stride, giving him great agility and the ability to make tight turns to create space for himself. Sometimes he lacks consistency in his effort level, which at times affects his overall speed. Controls the puck very well at high speed, showing the ability to beat defenders one-on-one and fool goalies with quick dekes in tight. While his elite shot is still his weapon of choice, he has been a more dynamic playmaker this season and he is displaying a more versatile skillset than before. His shot has a lightning fast release and good accuracy, but he seems to lose power on his shot when he can't set his feet. His knack for finding open space in the offensive zone in uncanny as he seems to evade defenders with ease and settle in soft spots in the coverage.  Defensively, he seems better suited for the wing, using his speed to force bad decisions at the blueline and focusing his energy on transitioning the puck. He can be a bit lazy on the defensive size of the puck and could be more involved physically more consistently, although he isn't afraid of the dirty areas or physical battles with bigger players when he is engaged. Overall, he has diversified his game and if he works on his consistency, he could be a solid offensive threat."
2020,RW,71,192,7,NJD,8,Alexander Holtz,"Holtz got a regular shift and power play time in the SHL this past season for Djurgarden, as one of the most productive U18 players that league has seen. Holtz has been on the prospect radar a long time. He has a lot of exciting dimensions to his game, but his goal-scoring ability stands out. He has a truly elite shot. He can pick corners from any spot in the offensive zone, with a very hard and accurate wrist shot. His hands are elite, which allows him to beat defenders clean with his 1-on-1 moves and pull off the occasional highlight reel play. While he is known for his goal-scoring, Holtz is also a very good passer. He won't be a top playmaker in the NHL, but he can find the seams and has the high offensive IQ to let plays develop and find his teammates. His skating is somewhere between average to above-average for me, but I did find his game lacked pace when I watched this season. Off the puck he's fine; he competes well enough but he's not an overly physical player and can be a bit of a perimeter player due to how much he leans on his shot.","I have to be honest: In recent months, as I finalized this list, I debated swapping Holtz and Raymond. At one point during this process, Holtz was No. 4 and Raymond was No. 5. There's a lot about Holtz's game I believe remains a tad disrespected. Everyone agrees he has power to his game and that he's got arguably the best wrist shot in the draft (his one-timer still needs some work). But some question his small area skill or his quickness or his playmaking talent. And while he needs to continue to develop his touch in traffic and his first few steps, I would argue the third point is a lot better than he usually gets credit for. Does he need to tunnel vision a little less when he has the puck? Sometimes. But I've seen him feather backhand passes through unsuspecting seams or feign shot before hitting the backdoor guy with a hard pass across the crease or use the attention his shot gets to hit the trailer off the rush. That will give his game more dimension than people realize, I suspect. He has already shown he can make an impact at the pro level more than most others near the top of this draft, too. I was particularly impressed with the way he handled being asked to play a new role on the power play (after spending his entire junior career on the flank, Djurgardens moved him to the slot).","Holtz find success from all over the offensive zone. While a plethora of his goals come from the slot, he has managed to score plenty of goals from just outside the faceoff dots.

Not only does Holtz embody strong shooting range, but he can pick corners with precision. Holtz can find the smallest gaps and still succeed. The only area in the offensive zone, in which Holtz should look to improve is his forechecking. The other area in Holtz's play that needs to be addressed is his puck control. Last but not least, let's touch on his skating. Holtz is not the fastest skater on the ice, but he does have a wide stride and will more than likely improve his speed over time.","There's a lot to like about Holtz, not the least of which is that his game continues to grow. After tacking on muscle last year, he handled the pro grind pretty well in Sweden. Holtz was a major factor for the Swedish world junior team that won bronze, and he showed a bit more commitment to two-way play. He is a natural offensive talent, with an elite release and quick hands. He has vision and offensive sense that challenge opposing defenses, along with the strength to drive the net. His skating is very good, and there's power in his stride.",Markus Naslund and Peter Forsberg. Those are the only two U18 skaters in SHL history to produce goals at a better rate than Alexander Holtz last season. We always knew Holtz could score; he has the best shot in this draft. It's his development everywhere else that solidified his hold on the sixth overall spot.,"Djurgardens winger Alexander Holtz is the best finisher in this year's draft, and it's not especially close. That was the case going into the season, and he's done his part to hold the throne as we close the book on the 2020 NHL Draft. 
The list of U18 skaters to score more goals than Holtz in the SHL is two players long. Holtz was one goal off the record set by Markus Naslund in 1991. 
No surprise there. Holtz set the record for goals in the J20 SuperElit as a draft-minus-one skater with 30 tallies in 38 contests just one year prior. He'd mercifully moved on to the men's squad this season, but that didn't stop him from scoring over two goals a game through three games of spot duty. 
His shot is as good as it gets, and it makes him a threat to score from anywhere in the offensive zone. He'I I avai I himself of any opportunity to shoot the puck too, as evidenced by the relatively even distribution of attempts plotted by lnStat in this handy shot chart. What's more, Holtz can let it rip without breaking his stride, a feather in his cap that makes him a unique threat off of the rush. It's just the sort of tool one could reliably build their career around. 
That seemed to be the plan for Holtz going into this season too. It'd worked for him up to that point, and if it ain't broke, don't fix it, right? 
The best players are never satisfied, and Holtz's rapacious appetite for improvement informed tremendous growth in every other facet of his game over the course of this season. 
Simply put: Holtz might be the player who most developed from the start of the year to its conclusion. 
""This kid is so, so driven,"" one scout told EliteProspects this season. ""He's always in the weight room, always putting in extra time after practice, always putting in the work."" 
That's one voice in a chorus of endorsements leaguewide for the player perhaps most admired by the scouting community for their character off of the ice. 
It's plain to see on the ice, too. Where an unengaged Holtz once floated between the blue lines, he's now backtracking with enthusiasm. Where a passive Holtz once floated towards loose pucks in offensive zone retrievals, he now engages physically and often pins his opponents to the boards in support. 
He's never going to win a Frank J. Selke Trophy for his defensive work at the next level. His odds are in the same ballpark as the rest of us at EliteProspects. But if Holtz can maintain average or slightly above average defensive metrics at the NHL level, then it's going to make him a much more valuable, reliable player. 
Similarly, Holtz is never going to lead the league in assists. He's trigger-happy to a fault, and that often comes at the expense of his linemates' opportunities to score in prime positions. Even when Holtz finds himself in an obvious passing situation, his vision often fails him. 
For Holtz to reach his ceiling, he'll need to add muscle, refine his defensive reads, and just continue along the course he chartered this season. 
Isn't that just par for the course though? Holtz is a pure sniper as currently constructed, and he has the potential to be a first-line finisher with triggerman utility on the power play. He's a special, special talent, and if he can refine that talent then there's no telling where it might take him. ","Similar to Raymond, I had Holtz in my top five to begin the year and I had pretty high expectations of him heading into the season. Similar to Raymond, Holtz has struggled at times in the Swedish men's league, though he has managed to put up 9 goals. He did have an excellent World Junior Championship also, posting 3 goals as an under-ager.

Holtz is a nature goal-scorer and has one of the best shots in the draft. He finds ways to get open in traffic to create scoring opportunities. Holtz looks like a one-dimensional type player, but his goal-scoring upside is high. He looks like a top-six winger who may need another year or so of development.","A pure goal scorer and elite offensive threat, he is a dynamic forward who is an agile skater when he keeps his legs moving. While he needs to work on his acceleration and speed, he makes up for it with his dangerous shot and goal scoring abilities – and he isn't afraid to shoot the puck often. Highly skilled when it comes to creating space for himself and his teammates in the offensive zone and ability to keep control of the puck. He sees the ice very well and uses his hockey IQ to find open teammates with accurate passes. Has a keen nose for the net and causes a lot of issues for opponents with his flair for making plays. He has built on his frame this summer and looks strong in puck battles, using his frame to protect the puck. Defensively, he keeps his head on a swivel and keeps an eye on his man while also watching the play and staying in position. Whether he is blocking a shot or breaking up a pass, he is invested in his own end. One bad habit he will need to break is the temptation to cheat on the breakout, leaving his teammates behind. He is a player that can make a huge impact in the NHL if paired with a playmaker and will surely score a lot of goals at the next level. Seems to learn from his mistakes and will be relied upon for power plays and special teams in the future."
2020,G,75,176,11,NSH,9,Iaroslav Askarov,"Askarov is one of the best goalie prospects I've seen as a first-year draft-eligible. He was unusually successful versus men as a 17-year-old, including a brief KHL appearance. He helped take down a very talented Canada U18 team almost single-handedly, same for a powerhouse USA U18 team as the best goalie at the U18 worlds in 2019. He has elite attributes in terms of his athleticism, in how he reads the game and how aggressive he is. His quickness allows him to make the tough saves, although I don't find him scrambling and diving around the net a lot given how well he anticipates the play. He's a little jumpy in the net just due to how quick he is, but he's in control most of the time, staying with the play even when the puck is moving quickly. Askarov is often challenging shooters even in unorthodox situations, but he isn't often beat when he is aggressive, which speaks to his hockey IQ. He was terrible at the world juniors, letting in a lot of soft goals, but that is not the player I've seen for most of the past two years in international play at various levels. He will need to work on making sure fewer mid-distance shots go in, but his home plate play is elite. I think he will become an upper-echelon goalie in the NHL.","Askarov has pretty much everything teams look for in a goalie. He's one of those rare prospects (along with 2021's Jesper Wallstedt, believe it or not) who is worth taking in the first round. He's big, he's athletic, he swallows rebounds, he can make those tough second-chance recovery saves, he does a good job staying centre, he has an extended domestic and international track record of success and he doesn't turn 18 until the middle of June. If I have one concern with his game that kept him out of my top 10, it's the jitteriness I've talked about in his game before. He doesn't load up on his push-off leg like most goalies when he's going post-to-post. Instead, he bounces and hops around the net. And though it's a peculiar trait, it works for him and reportedly helps to keep him engaged and focused.","Askarov is one of the stronger goaltenders in the group. His above blocker, below blocker and below glove percentages are higher than some of his peers. But, it is abundantly clear that Askarov has some work to do in developing his glove work as shots that go higher than his glove have an 18% chance of getting past him.
Aside from Askarov's glove and blocker work, he is a strong hybrid goaltender that will rely on his butterfly quite often when his opponents have possession of the puck in his zone. He does an outstanding job of using his edges and power pushing off of his pads to move around the net at a quick rate. ","Average performances at the world juniors and the U18 Five Nations tournament might have raised some questions, but if you judge the entire picture and not just two events, he remains among the best goaltending prospects to enter the draft in some time. He is such a monster in the crease, as good as any goalie I've seen at his age going post to post. He never quits on plays, and while he can make the big save, he makes a lot of his work look easy. There's explosiveness and power in the way he plays the position, but he can keep it quiet and simple, too.","It wouldn't surprise me if a team in desperate need of help in-goal drafted Yaroslav Askarov much earlier than 11th overall. Not one bit. He's one of if not the best goalie prospect in a decade-plus. An athletic specimen with an established track record of performing in big moments, Askarov is going to be the first goalie called in the draft, and by a wide margin at that.","The performance of Sergei Bobrovsky in the postseason - combined with his massive, all-in contract from the Florida Panthers - has understandably reignited the debate about where Russian prospect Yaroslav Askarov should go in the draft. 
Idea I ly, a team that sincerely needs a goaltender to boost up their pipeline in the next two-ish years will snag him within the top 10 to 15 picks. He's miles ahead of the other goaltenders available in the draft, and his development - not to mention his development path, which have seen him already thriving in the pros - make him an easy bet as a goaltender who will be 
NHL-ready sooner rather than later. But making sure he's given room to grow -- something that first-round picks at other positions are afforded with sheltered starts -- could be tricky for a team struggling to provide adequate defence in front of him. I'd stil I peg him as a top-10 pick, but he'll be interesting to consider nonetheless. 
Smart, and already remarkably controlled for his age, Askarov has all the agility and eye-opening movement range you'd expect from a Russian-developed goaltender, but with an added level of control to his game that few his age can boast. His skating is above average -- although that's no longer a distinguishing factor to the degree it was five or ten years ago -- but what really makes him stand out is the way he utilizes a range of depth management to effectively make the most of his wide stance, fluid movements, and fast feet. He has incredible reaction speed, but you don't see as many 'desperation' saves as one might expect from a goaltender who has the kind of movement he does; instead, he does a good job of controlling himself within the blue paint when he needs to and he's difficult to pull out of position by holding sustained pressure on his team's end of the ice. Occasionally you'll catch him over-sliding, but he's got good tracking and recovery mechanisms. 
When talking with other goaltending evaluators over the last year, Askarov's glove hand has been one of the biggest areas of concern - although there are multiple theories on why that may be. There's a chance that his lower-body movement and depth management has been the priority, especially as he's moved up the ranks so quickly within the Russian hockey system. He's gone from playing junior hockey to the VHL, then to the KHL, al I as a teenager; with a drastically different ski I I set and game pace at each level, it's possible that tailoring his mental game and his depth management to his current situations has been the priority while he leaves his hands developed in practice, but not the area of focus when it comes to the long haul of a season. 
Another possible explanation was given by a fellow goaltending evaluator when we talked about Askarov back in May. His theory was that Askarov's positioning - which see him utilize the kind of wide, low butterfly that Bobrovsky has made so popular during the height of his career - leaves him vulnerable visibility-wise up high. That means that even if his hands are active, he isn't going to be quite as efficient with them as someone who covers more space over the top half of the net. It's an interesting possibility, especially given that Finnish goaltenders sometimes manage to play both wide and low and with incredibly active hands. But ultimately, Askarov is still just eighteen; having struggles with his glove hand as his main area of concern is hardly anything worth scoffing over. ","Evaluating goalies is difficult and past drafts have shown us there is a real risk to taking any goalie in the first round. However, if there is a player that could buck that risk, it's Askarov. As a 17-year-old, Askarov has torn up various leagues in Russia, including getting a start in the KHL. He had difficult World Juniors, but this hasn't hampered my opinion of him, especially considering his age.

Askarov is big, confident, and athletic. Outside of the World Juniors, he has also been consistent over the past few years. He may be the first goalie taken in the top 10 since Carey Price and the hype is warranted. Like most Russian players, he is unlikely to make the jump to North America or the NHL for at least a year or two. Askarov has the potential to be a high-end number one goalie at the NHL level.","To say that Askarov is the best goaltending prospect to come along since Carey Price isn't hyperbole. What he has been able to do over the past two years, both internationally and in league play, is nothing short of remarkable. Not only is Askarov elite in many different goaltending categories, he also doesn't have many weaknesses. His athleticism is exemplary, allowing him to explode post-to-post, shoot out to challenge shooters and quickly spring back up from the butterfly to his stance. Due to his size and ability, he covers a lot of the net naturally and make it difficult for shooters to find open net. His form and reflexes are all stellar, allowing him to stop shots from any angle that he faces square. Pucks simply just don't go through him, over him or under him. Has an incredibly advanced understanding of how to swallow rebounds or direct them into corners. Does a very good job of tracking pucks through traffic. The biggest weakness to his game right now is probably an occasional tendency to overcommit, sliding a little too far to either side of his net and opening up a little too much room for shooters, but given his elite understanding of the position there's no reason to believe that he won't be able to improve this as he develops. A mentally very strong goaltender who can also put away a bad goal and come back stronger, he plays with poise, maturity and calmness."
2020,D,73,185,5,OTT,10,Jake Sanderson,"Sanderson was leaned on as the top defenseman for the NTDP. He ended the season on a high note at the U18 Five Nations in February co-leading the tournament in scoring. He's a great skating defenseman in all directions with size that allows him to make a ton of stops. His gap control is excellent, and he killed so many rushes with how well he closed on opponents. He's also a physical player who shows no hesitancy to close on checks with his body. Sanderson's top speed is very good, not elite, but he can lead rushes well and isn't afraid to jump into the play. His edges are excellent, allowing him to spin off pressure, to pivot and walk the offensive blue line very well. He was the PP1 guy for USA, but the main question on him is his offensive upside. He has skill and can make a very good first pass, but I wouldn't call him a dynamic playmaker. His production may not wow you, but he had a strong NTDP campaign points-wise relative to other top defensemen at his age historically, especially since he didn't has a U18 World Championship to compete in and he's a very young 2002 birth date.","There are things about Sanderson's game and season that can't be disputed. He was excellent in the second half, which is likely linked to his summer birthday and the added runway he had (and has) to continue to develop as a result. He's an excellent skater. I used to think his skating was just very good but it's better than that, particularly in straight lines (though also laterally). He's a mature, polished defender for his age, not only in the way he defends the rush but also off the cycle with the decisions he makes on reads and pressure. I would, however, dispute his offensive upside. Some scouts believe Sanderson to be the clear No. 2 defenceman in this draft. Many of those same scouts believe he has the potential to be a first pairing defenceman. That's where I disagree, or at least where I have my doubts. Will Sanderson be able to run a power play as he progresses up levels as he has with the NTDP? Probably. But I don't think he's so dynamic that he's going to be a game-breaking offensive threat or a PP1 guy.

There's no question he can open up his feet and create lanes for himself across the offensive zone blue line:

And there's no question he can lead the rush and pull away in transition:

But I don't see the small area skill that most top-pairing defencemen now have:

Sanderson projects more as a well-rounded second-pairing defender for me and I will track his collegiate career closely to see if he can change my mind. With Senators prospect Jonny Tychonick leaving North Dakota for Omaha next fall and captain Colton Poolman graduating, Sanderson will likely be asked to do a lot behind Jacob-Bernard Docker and Matt Kiersted as a freshman with the Fighting Hawks next season.","No matter what zone Sanderson is in, he owns the ice. He is a robust two-way defenseman, who can apply tight gap control in his own zone and is elusive in the offensive zone.

In the defensive zone, Sanderson is tough to beat. If you are skating up the ice with the puck, Sanderson will track you, give you little room and will utilize his stick to steal the puck away from you. There are only two things that I would like to see improve in Sanderson's defensive game is his slot defense. At times, Sanderson's positioning in the slot will be off and will let his attackers slip by him. If Sanderson can strength his slot defense and apply the same pressure that he applies on the left and right side of the ice, he will be tough to beat. The second thing that I would like to see improved is Sanderson's decision-making when he is possessing the puck on the boards in his own zone. When you look at Sanderson's transitional play, you immediately fall head over heels. The Whitefish, Montana native is highly productive at getting the puck from his zone to the offensive zone. If Sanderson does carry the puck from zone to zone, he will make use of his strong crossovers, edges and pivots to work his way through the neutral zone and into the offensive zone. Not only will Sanderson control the cycle and be defensively responsible in the offensive zone, he also possesses a strong wrist shot and will complete accurate centered pass/tape to tape passes to help key up scoring chances.
","An incredible skater and pure two-way defender, Sanderson has risen up the charts this season and made an especially powerful impression by leading the U18 Five Nations tournament in scoring. Sanderson's offensive skills are not necessarily the strongest points of his game, but he has a great understanding of how to make plays when they're available to him. He's not going to force it just to force it. And defensively, Sanderson is one of the more gifted blueliners in this class with good physical strength and a propensity to initiate contact. The son of former NHL forward Geoff Sanderson, Jake has an excellent feel for the game and doesn't get caught out of position often. He plays like a pro and is headed to the University of North Dakota, where his game should flourish.","We've seen the light. Many of the scouts and executives we spoke with upon publishing our last draft board told us that Jake Sanderson was a top ten prospect. It seemed a little rich at the time, but we reviewed the tape, ran the data, and came to see things their way. Sanderson might not have the offensive dynamism of a Drysdale-type, but he does everything really damn well.","There's a theory in some scouting circles that the USHL is a criminally under-covered league, and USNTDP U18 defenceman Jake Sanderson might be a skating example of just that. 
The games stopped, and Sanderson's stock kept on soaring. It's amazing what added exposure can do for a player's stock when everyone has the time to check the film. 
We just might be guilty as sin on this charge, too. Sanderson creeped towards the top-ten before the hockey world paused, but it's the time we've spent investigating his game since that has vaulted him firmly into the mix. 
When I say firmly in the mix; I mean firmly in the mix. There really isn't much room between Sanderson and our top-rated defenceman Jamie Drysdale of the OHL's Erie Otters, our No. 5 ranked skater in the upcoming draft. 
Stylistically, of course, they are world's apart. We love to bet on upside, and Drysdale's offensive defensive stylings lend itself to just that. 
Sanderson, on the other hand, is the rare jack of all trades, somehow also a master of all trades player. He doesn't play with a level of offensive dynamism that we've come to expect of defenceman with this sort of price tag, but he does everything at an above-average to high-end level right across the board. 
It all starts in the feet for Sanderson. He's an elite skater, layering nimble ankle flexion through a 90-degree knee bend, with fluidity through his hips. His boot placement allows for the maximum generation of power through the entirety of the blade, with his feet underneath his knees as the mark of a wel I-placed stride recovery.
The force multiplier on Sanderson's skating is the authority and decisiveness with which he plays. There's no hesitation on Sanderson's part when closing on an opponent, angling into a board battle, or sprinting into a pocket of space. 
If the player I've thus far described sounds like an ace in transition, that's with good reason. Dir. of North American Scouting  had this to say in a June meeting: ""Sanderson is the best transitional defenceman I've come across in four-plus years of collecting this data."" Sanderson does an excellent job of mitigating risk with his footwork, timing his c-cuts well, and guiding the puck-carrier calmly to within his reach, at which point he drives the shoulder through his opponent and eliminates possession. 
If Sanderson finds himself in a position to collect the puck; he immediately turns place up-ice, whether it's with a 
wel I-placed stretch pass or by carrying it himself through traffic. He's not afraid to use the middle of the ice, and he's surprisingly nimble in transition for someone who isn't especially skilled, handling the puck ably on the forehand, the backhand, and integrating slip and hook passes in sticky situations. 
Where one arrives at skepticism with Sanderson's game is what happens when the puck is in the offensive zone. He's doubtless shown significant development this season as a creative distributor, and he started to flash some serious puck skills before the stoppage in play. It's just that he started from a fairly limited spot; even drastic improvement doesn't put him in the upper echelon of offensive defencemen in this year's draft. 
Mostly, Sanderson creates through rush activation and as a trailing option on developing rush plays. Here's what our USHL scout had to say about Sanderson's offensive skill set in a player report on the North Dakota committed defenceman. 
""Without the puck, Sanderson recognizes appropriate times to join the rush and pinches on opposing wingers well, sealing off pass options along the boards and, in turn, preventing breakouts. He's got a quick wrister as well that can create havoc"" There are no such questions about Sanderson's ability to defend. On the puck, off the puck -- he's full value, likely the best in-zone defender in the entire class. He's calculated, disciplined, physical, and creative. There just isn't much that he can't do in the defensive zone at an exceptionally high level. 
Then there are, of course, the intangible qualities. Talk to anyone who's had the chance to interview Sanderson, on the media or the team side, and they'll all rave about his quality as a leader and a stand-up kid. 
We value upside first and foremost at EliteProspects, and Sanderson has everything it takes to develop into a No. 2 or 3 defenceman with value in all three phases of special teams at the next level. It doesn't sound sexy, especially for a player in this range, but it's a result most teams wi 11 take any day of the week around tenth overal I. ","The son of long-time NHLer Geoff, Sanderson skates like his father. Sanderson has a long stride and uses it to gain ground on attacking forwards quickly. He is also very physical and uses his frame well to rub out opposing forwards. He isn't afraid to step up in the neutral zone and throw a big hit either. 

Sanderson does everything well, but it's his upside that has him approaching the second half of the first round for me. While his speed is uncanny and he looks like a solid two-way defender, he is unlikely to ever be a big point producer, though after some further observation I believe the tools are there. He looks like a sure thing as a second-pairing defender who can play in all situations, meaning he will likely be coveted and could even enter the top 10. 
","A highly mobile defenseman, Sanderson is incredibly athletic and has an incredible toolbox. Using his smooth skating to be a dynamic puck-moving defender, his hands and decision-making have steadily caught up with his feet. He's incredibly elusive with the puck, able to turn on the jets and cut through traffic with ease. Gets up to speed in a hurry, both forward and backward, with long, smooth strides. Likes to take matters into his own hands and carry the puck for zone exits and entries. Defensive work is average, as he keeps a good gap and can recover into position quickly, but he lacks size and strength, and doesn't seem to see the ice quite as well without the puck as when he has it. Turns over the puck at times, but that's to be expected for a guy who has it on his stick as much as he does. Offensively, he exudes a lot of confidence and clearly wants to make a positive difference for his team. However, his decision-making is an issue, as his puck rushes often end up going right into dangerous areas before the puck ends up getting turned over and going the other direction. He uses his skating to get his shot through opposing defenders, though his shot itself and his passing are good but not elite. He mostly makes simple plays on the man-advantage because he doesn't have enough creativity. Overall, he is a defender that has the potential to combine mobility, strength, physical play and speed with a high-level vision and hockey IQ."
2020,C,73,185,12,FLA,11,Anton Lundell,"Lundell was very impressive at the pro level the past two seasons, putting up significant numbers in Liiga as a 17 and 18-year-old. I watched Lundell a ton the past three years, with at least 15 live views and many others on video, and I still struggle with what to make of him. I see a player who has played up versus men at a young age so effectively, who has played years ahead of his age group, sometimes in significant roles such as when he logged nearly 20 minutes in the gold medal game at the world juniors in 2019. When you watch him, though, his game can look bland. His speed is average, and while I see flashes of great creativity from him as a handler and passer, I wouldn't say that's consistent. I respect that he competes well, he's strong on pucks and is responsible defensively with the ability to play on both special teams. I also understand that he plays at the Liiga level so his skill won't pop as easily as someone who plays in the CHL.","There are some misnomers out there about Lundell's talent level and skating as being major concerns in considering him a top-10 pick. I disagree, to varying degrees, on both of those positions. He doesn't have the dynamic qualities of the forwards listed ahead of him on my board, and he's never going to consistently burn defenders off the rush, but he's a better passer than he normally gets credit for, he's heavier on the cycle than most of his peers, he can play through the middle of the ice and he makes decisions and reads quickly, which is just as important (if not more important) as his actual foot speed. It always feels like Lundell is involved and impacting a game (with and without the puck). Over the course of a game, that drives results. It shouldn't surprise anyone that as a teenager in a top pro league, Lundell had a positive impact on possession, played more than 15 minutes a night or won 53.5 percent of his draws while producing offence consistently.

In the video below you can see some of the visual cues that might prompt some negative takeaways in watching Lundell. He's got a hunch in his stride and a pitchfork skating stance that he will need to work to clean up. But where is he through the sequence? He's involved and on the puck. And what is the outcome? Well, it's Lundell finishing high and short-side:","Lundell plays like a 30 year old veteran. Instead of focusing on himself and using his ice time to solely put on a jaw-dropping display, the Finnish forward is a team-player first.
 In terms of his skating, he has a wide stride, in which his feet are consistently planted wide apart. In addition, his crosses are always in fine form. As I touched on earlier, Lundell has a quick release shot. You can expect Lundell to lean more on his wrist or snap shot. Passing is the one area of Lundell's game, in which he can struggle at times. ","Lundell is one of the most mature, intelligent players on the ice in this class. After all, he has two professional seasons under his belt already, showcasing high-end vision and playmaking skills while showing a commitment to play defensively. His defensive value is highest among forwards in this range; there's detail in his game at both ends of the ice. His puck skills are just average, but he makes things happen.","The premier shutdown centre in the 2020 NHL Draft? You're reading about him, and his name is Anton Lundell. What he lacks in upside is more than accounted for with an elevated floor relative to the vast majority of his peers. Lundell has been playing against men in the Finnish Liiga for two years now, holding his own with solid two-way metrics and a great scoring profile. He's not likely to stay in the Liiga much longer.","If his draft stock is any indication, HIFK centre Anton Lundell might've just put together one of the most under-appreciated U19 seasons in Liiga history. 
It's not often first-time draft-eligible skaters hold down a regular spot in the Finnish men's league. Seasons in which those skaters score at over a half a point per game clip are even less frequent. 
There are only 16 players (11 if we shrink the sample to the last 20 seasons) to suit up for 40 games or more in the Finnish Liiga in their first-year of draft-eligibility and hit the half a point per game mark. Lundell ranks eighth in the group, with 28 points in 44 games coming at a 0.64 per game rate. 
It's hard to imagine anyone in that group matched Lundell's two-way impact either. ""[Lundell's] two-way numbers reached absurd heights as HIFK controlled 61.9 percent of the shot attempts at 5-on-5,"" Lassi Alanen, our Finnish regional scout, remarked in an article on the steady Finn's game. ""That Corsi rate is the second-best mark in the league among qualifying players.""
Perhaps some of it is just bad luck? Where prospects like Tim Stutzle, Lucas Raymond, and Alexis Lafreniere had the chance to shine under the bright lights on the U20 World Hockey Championships stage; Lundell had to withdraw from the tournament at the last minute due to injury. 
The more likely reason for Lundell's drop is his playing style. He's a quietly effective two-way pivot without any obvious skills that jump off the screen and demand one's attention. Lundell is sometimes at his best when one doesn't really notice him at all. 
Everything about Lundell's game is methodical and calculated. He's thinking two or three steps ahead of his opponents at any given moment. 
That perspicacity is a survival mechanism as much as anything else. Lundell's skating stride isn't going to win him any footraces for loose pucks. It's not going to cover for any mistakes. If he's not thinking two or three steps ahead, the flow of play is liable to leave him one or two steps behind. 
Lundell is limited by a relatively short stride for someone with his stature. His knee-bend is far from the desired 90 degrees, and there is a lack of ankle flexion which limits the power he can generate out of every extension. His stride recovery lands well outside his frame, and he struggles to get his feet beneath his knees, too. It's just a series of mechanical skating failures heaped on top of each other. 
This lack of explosiveness limits Lundell's ability to create off of the rush in anything beyond a supporting capacity. It's much less of an issue during established offensive zone possessions though. 
His off the puck habits, whether it's driving the net or being mindful of his spacing, create a tonne of room for his linemates. Lundell has a good habit of finding pockets of space in the offensive zone and making himself a passing option for his linemates, too. 
There's some belief among our group that Lundell is only scratching the surface of his potential as a goal-scorer, too. Alanen remarked on Lundell's shot in a player report that ""his release can beat goalies from distance -- smart placement, and he can sneak shots past defender's legs, etc."" 
He has a valuable resource for improving in this realm too in his father, Jan Lundell, the goalie coach for HI FK. Lundell told EP Rinkside's Russ Cohen that he's been learning how to better understand goaltenders al I season so that he might learn how to pick them apart as a sniper. 
Ultimately, Lunde I I is going to generate much of his value in the defensive zone. That's where he's at his best. He's so hard on the puck; an eager combatant in puck battles with a track record in those contests that matches his enthusiasm. Even if Lundell's 6-foot-1, 187-pound frame doesn't seem that imposing; it's almost all muscle, and he's a tough customer. 
His reads off of the puck are great, too. Rare is the moment where Lundell is out of position, and you'll never have to worry about him flying the zone early. 
There just aren't many players with a higher floor than Lunde I I. He's bound to ingratiate his coaches with his no-nonsense approach and defensively sound posture, and that counts for a lot. 
It's easy to project Lundell into a middle-sox role with penalty killing utility at the NHL level. He's just about a guarantee to stick at centre, too. 
If we didn't value upside more than, well, just about anything -- that might be enough to vault Lundell to somewhere around fifth-overall. As is, he settles in closer to ten. ","Scouts are split on Lundell's ceiling. However, they don't question that he is one of the most well-rounded players in the draft. Lundell doesn't possess any specific elite qualities, but he does everything well. His best attribute is his hockey sense and on-ice intelligence. Lundell never looks the fastest or even the most skilled, but he manages to put up points. His game is so well-rounded it's hard to imagine teams passing on him in the early stages of the first round. I think he could be a number two center at the NHL level at best. He is a “safe” pick, but he could be a very average third-line player.","Lundell is a complete 200-foot center who works equally hard on both ends of the ice. His skating has improved and while he still might not be the smoothest skater, once he gains top speed, he's very hard to stop. He has the separation speed that allows him to gain a step ahead of defensemen, however, his agility could get better. Flashes great playmaking skills and can distribute the puck on tape with pressure and traffic around him. Doesn't need a lot of time to make plays happen and often seems to know what to do with the puck before he even has it. While he might not be flashy, he possesses a dangerous wrist shot which he can use within seconds. Strong release and accuracy make it a dangerous weapon. The power behind his shot is sometimes inconsistent but it has improved since the spring. His hand-eye coordination is well above average as he can bat pucks out of the air on passes by his opponent. His defensive play in the neutral zone is tight and controlled. He closes on puck carriers when he has support and ensures that the puck stays to the outside. In his own end, he shows a willingness to engage physically along the boards and his ability to find the puck in a scrum is high-level which leads to him winning 50/50 board battles more often then not. He uses his stick to disrupt passing lanes. Uses his high hockey sense to make him an all-around threat."
2020,C,69,175,13,CAR,12,Seth Jarvis,"Jarvis had a fantastic season, as the WHL's second-leading scorer and a major part of why Portland was such a dominant team. Jarvis is a dynamic player who ticks a lot of boxes. He is a highly skilled and intelligent with a lot of quickness. He has the skill to beat defenders 1-on-1, but more importantly, he does so with speed. The high-end pace of his game is what makes him so dangerous and will translate to the higher levels. He has legit NHL speed and very good edges, allowing him to pressure defenders at the highest level with speed and cutbacks. I wouldn't call his hands elite or call him an elite passer, but he has flashes of the highest level with both and both attributes are very good. Jarvis isn't the biggest forward, but he is a very hard working player. He attacks the middle of the ice consistently, he's hard on pucks and wins far more battles than you'd think a 5-foot-10 forward would. His game is very direct and he will be both a coach and fan-favorite due to the way he plays the game. His combination of skill, speed, production and work ethic make him a player that projects to play high in an NHL lineup.","I liked Jarvis' game when I watched him last year, but I wondered whether he had the dynamic qualities a player his size typically needs to be more than the kind of player you take in the 20s or 30s in the draft and project into a middle-six role rather than confidently as a top-six one. He looked good, but he never wowed me. And then he just got better and better this season. By the end of the year, he was one of the best players in junior hockey and an unstoppable force who played — and produced — above and beyond his linemates. I don't tend to like to make comparisons to other players but he's a slick playmaker who reminds me a little of a blend between Nick and Ryan Suzuki. He's got the well-roundedness across his toolbox and the three-zone work ethic that Nick possesses, with some of Ryan's knack for the dramatic. And though I saw the former skills a year ago, I either missed some of that flair or it progressed a little later than his peers. He's just flat out good offensively and despite his size is a responsible defensive option.","When you tune into a Portland Winterhawks game, you quickly see that the player that possesses the strongest motor, mobility and determination to bring home a win game-in game-out is Seth Jarvis. From a transitional and puck movement perspective, Jarvis shines in almost every shift. But, even in those instances where Jarvis does not possess the puck, he constantly looks for opportunities to muster scoring chances. As I mentioned above, given his quality motor and desire to move the puck, he completes plenty of controlled zone entries. In the defensive zone, Jarvis is not as aggressive as he is in the offensive zone. There are times where he plays more of an insurance role, but there are also instances where he will get a bit physical with his board play. 
","Another player I liked more and more with additional looks at the film, Jarvis has a lot of dynamic elements in his game. Quick hands and solid north-south speed contributed to Jarvis improving his WHL scoring total by nearly 60 points over the previous season to finish second overall in the league with 98 points. No U18 player was particularly close to what Jarvis did this season, as he averaged 1.69 points per game and was ahead of the next-closest age peer by 28 points. The year-to-year progression not just in scoring but also in Jarvis' offensive confidence is particularly striking. He doesn't have great size, but the speed and growth in skill suggest a higher ceiling than I previously thought Jarvis had.","Seth Jarvis can do it all, and he can do it all very damn well. He's a gifted puck-handler, capable of finding his teammates through levels and traffic to complete highly creative, difficult plays in the offensive zone. He's on the smaller side at 5-foot-10, but Jarvis has big-time skill.","It was a tale of two seasons for Portland Winterhawks forward Seth Jarvis. 
Don't believe me? Check the splits. 
Jarvis put up 37 points (15 goals and 22 assists) through the first half of the season; he followed that up with 61 points (27 goals and 34 assists) on the back nine, a figure that unto itself would warrant first-round consideration. 
Granted, one scores at that rate from seemingly out of nowhere and worthwhile questions about how much of those results are sustainable and how much are smoke and mirrors are bound to arise. 
The good people at Pick224 had Jarvis converting on nearly 20 percent of his shots in all situations. Our partners at lnStat have Jarvis down for about 27 expected goals, a number set by the frequency and location of his shots - - the inference there is that Jarvis produced 15 goals more than he should have last season. accustomed to seeing at higher levels of hockey. The talent variance allows for the cream of the crop to rise to the top of the stats page annually, without fail. Even so, Jarvis was doubtless on the receiving end of a fair share of puck luck. 
That's not where the conversation ends though. Hell, we're barely getting started. Now that we've wrapped the boxcar stats in the appropriate context, let's go ahead and lay the qualitative basis on which they'll comfortably rest. 
Where to start? It's a surprisingly difficult question to answer. Jarvis is the unique player that does everything relatively well. There's no one standout tool driving his success, just a layering of plus abilities that make for a whole that's so much better than the sum of its parts. 
His ability to work in tight spaces seems as good a place as any. Our Dir. of North American Scouting, , has identified Jarvis' gravitational pull, and the ability to create with a defender draped on top of him as one of the strong suits of his game. 
""Jarvis is one of the best attackers in the draft with a defender on his back; he seeks out pressure with gear-changes or stops-and-starts, then creatively pulls away with an arsenal of moves: fully-weighted cutbacks exited with a crossover at the apex, independent-moving hands for added deception, give-and-goes and passing threats."" 
 continued. ""again, with a defender on his back, he can find teammates across the slot (even trailers) with regularity; Jarvis is a true dual-threat attacker."" 
He's the type of player who wants the puck on his stick, wants to carry the puck up the ice, wants to be the focal part of his team's offensive game plan. 
With a strong base of habits as a skater, including the deployment of crossovers through the neutral zone to build acceleration -- Jarvis has the foundation to be that player. 
His strong puck skills take it to the next level though. Jarvis can pass, shoot, or receive tricky passes through his stride. He keeps the puck within a safe distance and protects it well through small-ice scenarios. And one needn't worry about him missing a passing or shooting opportunity by overhandling. 
While we're confident in Jarvis' ability as a true dual-threat scorer, it's more of a 60-40 split for playmaking than 
goal-scoring. We've already broached the elevated percentages and the extent to which that perhaps inflated his goal totals. The other component is that Jarvis hasn't displayed a consistent ability to finish from intermediate-to-long-range. Most of his goals came from relatively close to the opposing goal. That's not a knock, by any means. It speaks to Jarvis' tearlessness, and that's just another feather to add to the plume in his cap. It's just that I'd be cautious about projecting him as an elite finisher at the next level as a result. 
He's got a wide array of releases, can change the angles on his shot, and can generate a fair bit of power on his wrist shot with very little wind up. There's something there, certainly. 
There's a pretty compelling toolkit at Jarvis' disposal, and it's one that's taken him from a fringe first-round pick to a potential top-ten selection in October. There aren't many flaws in his game, and if he keeps on this same path then there's a chance he could be a dynamic top-six forward at the NHL level. ","Like Perfetti, Jarvis looked great at the Ivan Hlinka tournament. He had a bit of slow start in the WHL, but he very quickly turned it around. He ended up leading the WHL in scoring from January to the present. Jarvis is small and skilled, like many forwards in this draft. He's an excellent skater who loves to score off the rush.

Jarvis has an excellent shot and uses a variety of placements to create offense. He plays an overall well-rounded game and has a high compete level. The Portland Winterhawk has climbed in rankings throughout the year and could find himself sneaking into the top 10. He looks like a top-six winger, with goal-scoring ability at the NHL level.","A true sparkplug of a winger, he is a treat to watch because of his competitiveness and intensity. Has explosive skating ability because he plays on his toes and churns his feet quickly, but his short strides do hurt his top gear. He gains separation but can have trouble maintaining it if opponents have enough time to catch up.  Plays with a ton of jump and hustle, getting involved in the play all over the ice. Oozes confidence when the puck is on his stick, and has the quick hands, quick feet and quick mind to be dangerous and unpredictable when he gets it in a good area. However, his shooting and playmaking ability could be better and will need to improve but he possesses a quick release. He is equally comfortable as the primary playmaker or as the triggerman.  His best assets are his game sense and panic threshold.  Can be a major threat in transition, both cutting inside as well as sliding to the outside and then floating sauces passes to teammates who are driving the net. For a small player, he plays a hard game and won't be found shying away from contact, board battles or the dirty areas of the ice. Defensively, he's a good penalty killer and is willing to do what it takes to help his team win. A polished player in all three zones of the ice, he has high potential as a high-energy player who can complement talented linemates."
2020,C,72,176,8,BUF,13,Jack Quinn,"Quinn had a massive 18-year-old season in the OHL, scoring 50 goals as a leading player on the best CHL team and breaking out into a legitimate top prospect. He scored a ton of goals, but I wouldn't really call him an elite sniper. Rather Quinn is just a super skilled and smart player who scored a lot of goals around the net. He has very quick twitch hands and the ability to embarrass defenders 1-on-1. He sees the ice at a top-end level even though he didn't have nearly as many assists as goals. It's not just his vision, but his overall creativity and patience. He often saw plays on the ice that I couldn't see materialize. The main reason for his sudden rise in stock was the continued improvement in his skating. It's not a strength of his, it's no longer a weakness, but it will be his main hurdle for the NHL level. Quinn is solid off the puck, playing PK for Ottawa, although I wouldn't call him a physical player.","There's nothing in Quinn's game to dislike. Add in dynamic ability as a mid-range shooter, impressive athleticism and a late-blooming career arc and it's no wonder he broke the 50-goal plateau. You have to consider the strength of his team when accounting for his excellent season, as well as his late birthday. But I would argue that his best hockey is still in front of him or point to his standout performance at the CHL Top Prospects Game or highlight the list of recent OHL 50-goal scorers in their draft years. Alex DeBrincat and Arthur Kaliyev are the only two draft-eligible OHL forwards to have broken 50 goals in recent memory. Both were selected too low in hindsight because other less important factors snuck into play. That mistake won't happen again with Quinn. He demonstrated enough versatility this year to suggest he's got more than just one standout dimension going for him. He's also got more room to fill out and get stronger than many of his peers, despite being older than most of them.","Quinn is a dynamic goal scorer and can light the lamp from all over the offensive zone. The other thing that I noticed about Quinn is that sometimes he struggles to get away from tight pressure. When he is facing tight pressure along the boards, sometimes he gets trapped and has nowhere to go. Quinn needs to work on fending off his attacker and using quick pivots to draw them off. Without working on deploying pivots, he will get sandwiched in the NHL and will struggle at working the cycle. ","I was a very slow convert to Quinn's game, but the more I watched of his tape, the more I liked what I saw. His scoring ability pops, and his skating has gotten to a level that makes me much more comfortable projecting him as a top offensive contributor at the next level. Quinn also has really good hands and can wire pucks. He has a really strong sense of the offensive zone and knows how to get to good ice to become more dangerous.",,,"Quinn has been a steady climber this season and his goal-scoring totals have shown his strongest asset: his shot. Quinn has scored at will in the OHL this season. There are some questions as to whether or not he is a product of playing with Marco Rossi and a handful of other strong players in Ottawa. However, his release and ability to get open to produce scoring opportunities lead me to believe he is a solid top 20 prospect. Quinn projects as a goal-scoring top-six winger at the NHL level.  ","Quinn has emerged as an exciting prospect to keep an eye on with solid foot speed and good agility and balance on his edges. A lightning quick first step and the ability to make plays at a high speed, he is difficult to contain but he needs to work on his consistency without the puck on his stick.  Low center of gravity and strong legs make him very difficult to knock off the puck. He excels at controlling the pace of play, using his hands and quick changes of direction to avoid defenders and create space for himself. He can beat defenders one-on-one with creative stickhandling and is good at carrying the puck into the offensive zone to establish possession. Adept at finding space for himself in dangerous areas of the offensive end, he is always looking for rebounds and deflection opportunities in front with ease. His shot is his most dangerous weapon thanks to a lightning-quick release. He can fight through contact and protect the puck well but doesn't seem to excel at separating his man from the puck with physical play. Pretty high IQ player who makes all the right reads and positioning decisions his teammates need to create high-quality offensive chances while remaining a non-liability on the defensive end. He isn't physically opposing in the defensive end but plays a two-way game by using an active stick and relying on his solid positioning. He isn't afraid to get into it after the whistle but could use more physicality during the game."
2020,C,72,180,18,NJD,14,Dawson Mercer,"Mercer followed up an impressive 17-year-old season with a better 18-year-old one, as a top player in the QMJHL and a member of Canada's U20 team. Mercer is a versatile player. Offensively, he's an exciting player. He has high-end skill with the soft hands and creativity to beat a lot of defenders. He has the quick-twitch in his hands to be unpredictable and make a lot of great plays in tight areas. He's a very smart player who moves the puck well inside the zone, finding seams and looking off defenders like a pro. Mercer can also score from a distance if given space, but I think his playmaking is more impressive. He's a competitive two-way center who can be effective in a lot of situations. He plays in the interior third of the ice a lot and can kill penalties. His main drawbacks are his average feet and lack of NHL caliber explosiveness as well as the minor fact of how he slowed down following a trade to Chicoutimi.","Mercer has learned to maximize everything he has. This isn't to say he isn't talented. He is. But I don't see the typical A-level tools you see in a top-15 talent and I still believe he's in that mix, so I wouldn't fault a team for taking him near the top 10. Mercer's effective all over the ice by making a lot of little plays with pace and aggression. He attacks defenders when he has the puck. He attacks opposing carriers when he doesn't. He wins more 50/50 battles than he should by getting underneath his man and keeping his feet moving. And then he has enough skill to escape pressure, beat the first defender and make a play. He's one of the safer bets to become an impactful NHL player. I would have liked to see him dictate play offensively a little more than he did after a trade to Chicoutimi, though, so that contributed to a bit of a fall from where I ranked him at the midseason point.","When you watch Dawson Mercer, you quickly notice that he has explosive speed. Aside from his skating, Mercer has great hands. It does not matter if he is on the rush or trying to circumvent tight defense, he manages to stick-handle around his opponents and keep the play alive. In the offensive zone, Mercer finds the most success when he is high-danger situations. He thrives at the crease and scored plenty of rebound goals in the latter half of the season with Chicoutimi. ","Mercer has great character and work ethic, but don't sleep on his skill level and hockey sense. He is committed to playing at both ends of the ice and can engage physically despite not being the biggest guy. I like his release and ability to create off the rush, too, and he adapts to situations well.","A mid-season trade to the Chicoutimi Saguenéens dulled Dawson Mercer's scoring totals down the stretch, but he's still one of the most offensively potent players in this year's draft. His puck skills in small ice situations are through the roof. It's not often first-year draft-eligible skaters get on to Team Canada, but Mercer held down a bit role on the gold medal-winning team admirably.","Blink, and you're liable to miss what makes Chicoutimi Sagueneens centre Dawson Mercer so special. 
Sure, there are the ten-bell maneuvers that jump off the screen. Those are pretty neat. It's the way that Mercer sets those moves up that makes them so special though. 
We don't usually think of players who carry themselves like renaissance painters as the game's great thinkers. We're conditioned to believe that it's overwhelming skill, and that's that. 
Mercer is different. He picks apart on-the-puck defenders in much the same way an elite NFL quarterback breaks down defensive coverages -- one read, one component at a time. Mercer deploys a wide array of false signals to trick defenders out of space, to pivot one direction with every intention of quickly transferring his weight in the opposite one. 
The same is true of his shot. There often isn't any indication or warning that a shot is coming off of Mercer's stick. He can one-time the puck in difficult small-ice scenarios, and that's just an extension of his sublime ability to corral even the most difficult passes through traffic. 
It's all about the setup. It always is with Mercer. He'll avail himself of any opportunity to make a screen of an opposing defender, and often changes the release point through his shooting motion to get pucks through feet, shin pads, etc. If there's anything Mercer can do to deceive, blind, or catch an opposing netminder off guard -- he'll mercilessly do precisely that. 
Think of it as an evolutionary mechanism in Mercer's game -- this cerebral, thinking person's approach. If one can't skate at a high-level and they're not towering over their opponents, then they best have a handle on how to outthink the opposition at every turn. This is very much so the case for Mercer, who is a below average skater endeavouring to play the position perhaps most dependent on one's ability to, well, skate -- centre. 
He's got very, very heavy feet, and they limit his ability to execute linear and non-linear crossovers, thus limiting his ability to generate speed. It's also a limiting factor when Mercer tries to emerge from his stance, with little if any two-step quickness. 
To Mercer's credit, he's a pretty crafty skater. Stop me if you've heard this before, but he's a thoughtful skater. He'll send false signals through his shoulders to force defenders through the neutral zone to commit with a pivot and then skate directly into their blind spot. It's something that we see a lot from the smarter players in the game. 
Our Dir. of North American scouting  put together a pretty great breakdown of Mercer's skating in this article from August on the 18-year-old prospect. 
""That Mercer's not finding separation in the OMJHL with his feet is, at the very least, a bit concerning. His stride lacks a bit of depth, failing to extend his knees over his toes and not sitting back deep enough into stride. The lack of depth transfers to his crossovers, where he's unable to properly cross one skate over the other, essentially placing on in front of the other. He completes his crossovers exclusively on his inside edge. By not including his outside edge, he doesn't receive any glide time - he just pushes and pushes, rather than push, glide, push. It's inefficient, but not cripplingly so; some players just weren't meant to go fast. ""
Another way that Mercer makes up for his deficiencies as a skater is by playing a counter-attacking style and moving the puck with a great deal of pace. His hands move at an exceptional speed. too. The way he thinks the game? Well, you know. 
There is some skepticism among our group whether Mercer is going to play centre at the next level. There's the skating --that's an issue. There's also the matter of Mercer's propensity to wander a bit and make questionable off the puck reads. There's no doubting his work rate though -- that's one feather in his cap 
Our skepticism has dissipated with time this scouting season though, for whatever that's worth. , our OMJHL regional scout. is confident Mercer can hold down the middle of the ice at the NHL level. 
That helps build Mercer's case as a pretty special, valuable prospect in this range. He's a credible triple-threat player. There isn't much he can't do, aside from winning the fastest skater competition at All-Star Games. ","Mercer was a surprise pick for Canada at the World Juniors. He looked great in limited minutes. Mercer loves to drive the net and uses his skill and speed to create space for himself to cut from the outside-in. His offensive game is very rounded, and he plays with a high compete level and engine. Mercer has an excellent release and looks like a top-six winger at the NHL level.","A complete and competitive playmaking power forward with a smooth and powerful stride that gives him a great top speed. His skating is above average in every aspect; he can accelerate quickly, his top speed helps him put defenders on their heels, he can cut and turn quickly to attack the center ice and has great agility helping him escape from tight spaces. He has impressive strength and balance, which allows him to win most of his board battles. He won't often throw big hits, but he'll get into any physical engagement to recover the puck. Despite being excellent on the forecheck, he prefers creating controlled zone entries than dumping the puck in the offensive zone. He always has the heads up which gives him a good vision of the play. He makes smart decisions with the puck to keep the possession, and get his teammates involved by opening the play frequently. He has an excellent compete level as he's the first to forecheck and backcheck. He gets into dirty areas to get hold of the puck or crashes to the net to take rebounds. He also owns a powerful wrist shot and some decent passing skills to help set up teammates. He's at his best on the offense in the opposing team zone but he can help his team on the defensive side, too, by blocking shots or disrupting passing lanes with an active stick.  He is always one step ahead of the game and reads the ice well."
2020,LW,72,167,15,TML,15,Rodion Amirov,"Amirov bounced around between the pro and junior level all season. He was excellent versus his peers at the junior level, and versus men he showed flashes, including in a brief appearance late with Russia's national team. Amirov is easy to spot on the ice when he has the puck because he's very quick and skilled. He has quick-twitch hands and can inside-out defenders while skating at full speed. He can set up and finish plays well. He flashes high-end playmaking and shooting ability, but neither consistently. His game is more about his pure skill and driving play forward with a ton of clean entries. His speed isn't amazing, more just good; but his edges and cutbacks are excellent. Amirov has a slight frame, which led to struggles versus men who could knock him off pucks, but he does work hard and when he puts on muscle I could see him get inside easier.","I had Amirov at No. 20 on my preliminary list, No. 22 at midseason and he's back at No. 20 here. That should probably tell you a couple of things:

I'm pretty confident this is the range he belongs in.
He didn't exceed my expectations, nor did he fail to meet them.
The strength of Amirov's game is in his ability to protect the puck and change directions with control. This makes him particularly effective within the offensive zone because I wouldn't say his straightaway speed is all that high end. Amirov is dangerous because he takes what's given to him (he's not a pass-first player but he doesn't tunnel-vision the net as a shooter either), and he can carry the puck into the slot to draw pressure or create for himself.

Watch the way he cuts off the wall to spin his man around and get to a dangerous area on the ice here:

Or the way he changes directions to lose his man, in the same game, here:

Though Amirov indeed struggled in spurts in limited minutes (a little under 10 per game) in the KHL this season, his age-adjusted production across each of the last two years in the MHL is impressive and it's matched by an intriguing offensive toolkit. He's got a shot at being a good second-line forward.","One of my favorite things about Amirov is his ability to read playing surface and identify which teammate is going where. While Amirov reads on-ice strategy like a NFL Quarterback would, he brings much more to the table. With his soft hands, his passes seem to always be on target and he always has an extremely light release. In addition, with his hands, he possesses a strong stick-handling skill-set. In terms of Amirov's skating, he has some of the best crossovers in the 2020 NHL Draft class. Granted Amirov is not known for his shot and is more known for his two-way game, so this should not come as a shock. All-in-all, Amirov is a strong winger prospect and is dynamic in all three zones. The only areas where you would like to see some improvement is beating that last attacker with his puck-handling and working on his shooting ability from range.
","An especially skilled and crafty winger, Amirov was dominant in Russia's U20 ranks and played 21 games in the KHL this season. Despite a lack of production among pros, Amirov has some of the best skill in this draft. He has remarkably fluid puckhandling abilities and a deceptive, quick release on his shot. Amirov also competes down low and extends plays along the wall with good skating and creative puck work. He can open up ice and makes it count when he has the opportunity.
",,"This may come as some surprise, but Russia's Rodion Amirov was the leading scorer at the U18 World Hockey Championships last year, not Lucas Raymond. 
Amirov's nine points (six goals and three assists) through eight contests actually led Russia period, and were good enough to hold a four-way tie for seventh in the tournament in scoring. 
That's a hell of a way to announce one's self ahead of their first season of draft-eligibility. 
It's also the single greatest proof of concept for Amirov's gamebreaking ability, something we didn't see a great deal of in a year spent bouncing between the MHL, KHL, and VHL in Salavat Yulaev Ufa's system. 
That's more observation than critique though. Amirov didn't play a tonne in the KHL, featuring on the fourth line and sparingly at that, and only sipped a five-game cup of coffee in the VHL. The MHL is, well. .. it's no refuge for the skilled. 
That's not to say the skill level or competence isn't there. He strikes with strong habits, deploying crossovers through arced attacks on the rush, made all the more potent with a nice variety of rush patterns through the neutral zone preceding these forays. 
Where Amirov could stand to grow a fair bit is in mitigating the one bad habit that sometimes creeps into these plays, as he's liable to often widen his stance once he's changed his angle, 
a I lowing for the back-tracking forwards to close on him at the top of the offensive zone. 
It's something that cost him possession fairly frequently last season, but it's hardly a death knel I. It's something Amirov can easily work on with time. 
The more projectable elements of Amirov's strike patterns include the willingness to manipulate defenders between the blue lines and a willingness to play pucks into space. If that wasn't enough, Amirov's integrated the boards into his array of outlets as a passing tool, both to himself and his teammates. 
The basis of all this is, of course, Amirov's skating. He's so mechanically refined in this area of the game. He achieves full 90-degree knee-bend, with three-way flexion starting at the ankles, through the knees, and into the hips. His stride lands well within his frame, and the boot is tucked nicely underneath his knee. He achieves full-extension on his strides as a matter of habit. 
Any room for improvement in this realm is going to come from work in the weight room, and that's actually a fairly consistent theme throughout his game -- this was especially true in our viewings of Amirov at the KHL level. 
To his credit, Amirov works well within those limitations, even when applying pressure on the forecheck. In an ode to the Russian hockey of yesteryear, Amirov forechecks and backchecks like a sheepdog herding their flock. With a thorough mental map of the ice and everyone's positions, he funnels opposing breakouts to the parts of the ice where he has the most support, allowing for turnovers and quick counter plays. 
He's a bit of a dual-threat player, but the majority of his offensive contributions are the result of high-level puck-handling and distributing. His shot doesn't rate especially well, and he's not a capable one-touch finisher, often bobbling the puck in prime scoring positions. He's a heady shooter though and he creates a lot with well-placed shots that lead to rebounds or rely more on their precision than power. 
His anticipation, the ability to see plays before they develop, is another high-level tool in his toolkit. The strength of Amirov isn't that he's an intermediate or long-range finisher; it's that he finds ways to funnel the puck into high-danger areas where an elite shot isn't necessary to produce. 
To that exact end, Amirov is going to need to add a fair bit of muscle if he's going to bring this style of hockey with him as he climbs the professional ranks. It's already proven something of an obstacle at the KHL level. 
Still, there are a lot of nice, projectable qualities to Amirov's game. Even if he doesn't bring elite, top of the lineup talent to the fold, it's easy to imagine a scenario where he develops into a reliable top-six contributor at both ends of the ice with utility in both phases of special teams. I 'II take that at this point in the draft. ","Like Russian prospects of the past, Amirov is a hard player to project. He's bounced around leagues quite a bit and wasn't included on the Russian World Junior team. The Under-18's would have been a good test to see how he compared to other players. Alas, without that possibility, past showings will have to do in evaluating him. Amirov boasts typical Russian skill and smoothness to his game. He has a high skill set and a strong hockey IQ. He loves to create offense from the circles in. Amirov could be a steal as a potential top-six forward late in the first round.","Amirov is a very well-rounded offensive player who is one of the most entertaining prospects in the 2020 draft class. He is speedy with a quality first stride and good edge work, and while his skating is not explosive due to his stride length or lower-body strength, he's incredibly agile, balanced and deceptive on his feet. He displays strong transitional play as he weaves up the ice and dances around traffic. When he has the puck on his stick in the offensive zone, he's always a threat to make something magical happen, whether it's by setting up one of his teammates with a great pass or by doing it all himself. His cycle game is excellent, using a wide base, an upright head and slick puck skill to play keep-away while he scans for opportunities. Gets his shot off in a hurry and can release from tough angles. Displays above-average hockey sense in all three zones, allowing him to find holes in coverage on offense and pinpoint spots to apply pressure or pick off passes on defense. He has great defensive awareness and always has his eyes open for loose pucks and likes to create interceptions or deliver good poke checks in the neutral zone. Could stand to get stronger, as he's not great in physical battles once he runs out of space and has to get his hands dirty. Work ethic and motor are very good, allowing him to stay involved in the play in all three zones."
2020,C,72,178,24,CGY,16,Connor Zary,"Zary was one of the top players in the WHL in his third season in the league and the major reason why Kamloops led the WHL in scoring. Zary is a very entertaining player, as he's one of the most skilled players in the draft. His touches with the puck are very quick, he's extremely creative and he can beat defenders clean consistently. He had numerous moments this past season where he pulled off a highlight real-caliber play. Zary is a very smart offensive player. He can make the seam passes and find teammates very well, but also makes plays happen through unconventional ways. He scored a lot of bad angle goals this season, and he finds teammates in situations where there doesn't seem to be a play. Zary is a highly competitive player. He doesn't just dangle on the perimeter, he attacks the net, he pressures defenders and he is in the face of his opponents constantly. He can kill penalties and run your power play. The major knock on Zary is his skating. Some scouts think it'll be pro average, some think below-average. I lean to the former camp. It's not great, and the stride breaks down at times, but I think the stride is good enough that he'll be able to skate at the NHL pace.","Zary plays that middle-lane, tenacious, high-tempo game that every team covets in a centre. His feet are always moving, he pushes pace, he's engaged on the forecheck and he has enough skill to create as a playmaker and a passer. His footwork through his crossovers and speed in transition (an improved quality) opens up just enough time and space for him to make those plays — and then when that space closes in on him he's a deft handler who can navigate in and out of traffic. I don't see a star-level player. Zary doesn't have the flair of any of the forwards ahead of him or one dynamic quality that can break down defenders and split open a shift but he's a versatile, well-rounded creator who can drive a line.","Zary – while very “well-rounded” – does not do that many things at a high-end level. He is solid, or even, good, in almost every area, but not too much stands out in terms of skills or tools that present themselves to you as those of a future first line guy.

Offensively he can be dangerous on the cycle and the rush, and he uses a strong offensive IQ to get to danger areas, having no issue hanging out around the net, and generally finding a way to get clean air in-close. In terms of shooting he has a quick release and good accuracy, and can stun goalies with either a wrist or snap-shot. However, he does not have great power on his shot at this venture.","One of the best puck distributors in this class, Zary has high-end vision and is especially decisive with the puck on his stick. He wastes few plays. Zary finished fifth in the WHL with 86 points and was a leader on a resurgent Kamloops team. He has some edge, as well. There's little shyness to his game, and while he can create from the perimeter, he makes a lot of plays through the middle of the ice and near the net.",,"The scouting community's collective dossier on Kam loops Blazers centre Connor Zary is exceptionally long. He's already finished his third WHL season, and if that wasn't enough, he featured prominently on Canada's roster at the 2019 U18 World Hockey Championships as a draft-minus-one skater. 
We've certainly thought a lot about this player, too. He's probably one of the more low-key divisive players in this year's draft, if you'll permit me that colloquialism. 
I've talked to scouts who rate Zary as a bona fide top-15 pick without even a shred of doubt; I've also spoken to one who rates him as a second-round prospect. 
Connor Zary: It's a land of contrasts. 
We're right in the middle of those two extremes: think of it as Horseshoe Theory, but with a different application and actually real in this case. 
There's no denying his production. Zary finished fifth in WHL scoring with 86 points (38 goals and 48 assists) in 57 games as a first-time draft-eligible skater. , who is based in Western Canada, summed it up nicely in an article he wrote for EliteProspects Rinkside in August. 
""What do Nolan Patrick, Mat Barzal, and Cody Glass have in common? Zary outscored each and every one of them in their draft years Only six WHLers in the past decade recorded a higher point-per-game in their draft year than Zary did, fellow 2020 NHL Draft-eligible Seth Jarvis among them. "" 
Not bad, right? 
It's Zary's shot that leads the way. He's a deceptive triggerman, one with excellent shot placement. a deceptive release. and the ability to fire two-touch missiles on a moment's notice. 
""He's a downright clever shooter, picking spots all over the net: he uses unique placement, shooting low and against the grain with frequency.""  continued, ""he has the skill to adjust through his shot; easily shots through defensive pressure because feet are always ready to drop into weight shift; variety: wrist, two-touch. catch-and-release, snap."" There's a healthy volume of shots coming off his stick, too. According to Pick224.com, Zary averaged 4.51 shots per game, the third-highest rate in the WHL. Those shots were most threatening off the rush, which is a surprising quirk considering the dearth of transitional value that 
Zary brought to the table last season -- 's data has Zary in the 14th percentile among his sample in controlled entries 
per hour at 5-on-5. They don't often occur with Zary as the primary puck-carrier. He's more comfortable supporting the transition up-ice, finding pockets of space, and offering himself as a trailer. From there, Zary does his best to move goaltenders east-west, deploy screens using opposing defenders, shoots through legs, sticks, etc. 
His ability to collect difficult passes is a real difference-maker in many of these situations. Zary can corral passes with a nearly 360-degree radius, and he does an excellent job of transferring the puck with a soft touch directly into his wheelhouse. He doesn't often break stride to receive passes either, maintaining the pace of his team's attack. 
""Unlike most junior players, Zary lets passes come across his body before catching them, allowing him to step directly into his weight shift for the shot,""  wrote in his profile of Zary. ""Most junior players catch the puck in the centre of their bodies, adding an extra step into the catch-and-shoot process. That extra step - however little time it takes - is all defenders need to pressure the shot, if not erase it."" 
The reason Zary can't or doesn't really contribute much in transition is that his skating profile just doesn't allow for it. It's not outright awful. There are even rare occasions in which Zary's skating looks passable. But even in those spots, there are mechanical inconsistencies that hinder his progress up-ice. 
It starts with the way that Zary collapses at his hips, tilting forward, and causing him to dig with his toes. As a result, he tends to out-toe, which limits the amount of blade-to-ice contact, therefore suppressing the power generated through each stride. There's also a little bit of inefficiency and wasted motion through Zary's stride when he kicks his heels up, having to then level them before the next extension. 
Another area where Zary is fairly limited is as a distributor. He's prone to overhandling the puck, missing opportunities to create scoring chances through his linemates. Even in more static situations, Zary hasn't consistently displayed the ability to find teammates through traffic, much less execute on highly difficult passes. 
So, when considering Zary's strengths and weaknesses, we find ourselves leaning towards an NHL future spent on the wing. We see Zary as being skilled enough to contribute as a triggerman in the middle-six, playing the wing, and bringing his high defensive work rate to one fortunate team's penalty kill. ","Zary is a fun player to watch. He plays with a high level of compete and boasts a strong skill set. Zary has some of the best hands in the draft, especially in tight. He is a unique combination of compete and skill. Some scouts have questioned his skating, but he gets around well enough to have it not be a concern for me. He looks like a number two NHL center.","Zary showcases his skating ability in transition though the neutral zone as he is very fluid with the puck on or off his stick. He is always moving his feet, and although not fancy, he can deviate from routes quickly to get some space. He isn't the fastest skater though, and his acceleration/explosiveness leaves a bit to be desired, but he thinks the game well enough to still be one step ahead at this level. He has good edgework in the offensive zone without the puck, which means defenders must watch him closely as he can dart in and out of high danger areas. Pucks seem to follow him, and he has a strong knack to get pucks off his stick quickly into the hands of his teammates or snapped on net. His ability to move the puck quickly is an asset on the cycle down low, in transition, or by entering the zone and his passing skills is one of his biggest assets. His shot is average, though it could get better once he gains some size and strength to his frame. Though there is some aggression elements and urgency in the defensive zone, it's still a learning curve of where he needs to be and how to effectively pick up his man or present himself as a consistent support tool. Very much a work in progress but took a big step forward this year and shows effectiveness with his timing and opportunistic play at even strength and on special teams."
2020,C,72,203,14,EDM,17,Dylan Holloway,"Holloway had a fine freshman season, as a top player for Wisconsin, although he didn't put up huge scoring numbers after dominating the AJHL the season prior. Holloway is a good skater who has a lot of energy to his game. When he gets a full head of steam, his frame he can be a handful to stop. He's hard on pucks and isn't afraid to get his nose dirty. His offensive upside is the main point of debate surrounding him when talking to NHL scouts. I think he's very skilled. Holloway inside outs opponents consistently and can make plays through checks in motion. Over the years I've seen flashes of top-end playmaking, but I didn't see that consistently enough this season, with Holloway showing more of a direct style of play than a true driver of offense. Even if he's not a truly dynamic offensive player, there's enough skill in his game to be a quality NHL player.","I was really high on Holloway a year ago, believing he had a chance at the top 10 in this draft after he looked too fast and strong for the AJHL as a 17-year-old. Then he didn't grab hold of me in my early viewings with the Badgers. Then I saw him play live at Team Canada's selection camp in December, where he was excellent and followed that up by spending some time with him in Wisconsin and catching another two live viewings at the NCAA level. And when he really impressed me in all of those live sessions and I dug deeper on his season at Wisconsin with more tape in recent weeks, some of the things I'd seen that concerned me out of the gate began to fade. He's a unique athlete in this class, an outstanding skater, a physical presence and a talented scorer and creator. He's not going to be the driver that some of these others will be but I'd expect a breakout season as a sophomore and an impressive NHL career as a second-liner who provides some punch and pace.",,"Holloway was one of the most anticipated prospects of this class but struggled to adapt to the college game, albeit with a Wisconsin team that vastly underperformed. He was born only eight days after the 2019 draft cutoff and had a strong 2018-19 season (AJHL MVP). But his offensive game stagnated a bit this year, though he is still one of the better skaters in this draft class. There have been some concerns about his hockey sense, but I watched Holloway several times this season and just felt Wisconsin as a whole lacked punch. His play away from the puck needs to improve, but the physical tools are there.",,"Count Dylan Holloway among the handful of Wisconsin skaters that want a do-over on last season. 
Pretty much everyone on that team not-named Cole Caufield fell well short of expectations. And enough of them got out of dodge with entry-level contracts or graduated that Holloway is likely to centre a line with Caufield next season, so that's nice. 
In the interim, it's safe to say that some of the shine has come off Holloway over the course of his draft-year. 
He seemed earmarked for a top-ten pick after making a big statement at last year's U18 World Hockey Championships and then featuring in relatively prominent role on a major NCAA program. At the very least, the top-half of the first-round seemed feasible. 
Now, Holloway is likely to go closer to 20. We've ranked him 18th, and our the Consolidated Draft Rankings on our Draft Center page has him one spot higher at 17th. 
Most of the industry sources we've consulted with over the course of the season all seem to rate Holloway lower than the public sphere, though, so take that bit of information however you please. 
It's a question of upside this high in the draft, and nothing about this season gave the impression that Holloway is brimming with that quality. He's no slouch, obviously, but I don't think anyone is pencilling him into the first-line of their future at this point. 
There's no reason Holloway couldn't develop into a middle-six forward with two-way credibility though. That counts for something. 
It's the one part of his game that took a big, big stride this season -- the defensive side of the equation. 
Holloway featured primarily in a third-line checking role, anchoring a line with Tarek Baker and the Smol King Sean Dhooghe on opposite flanks. That trio took on the tough match-ups and ate a healthy serving of defensive zone starts at 5-on-5. For their trouble, they left with a plus-two shot attempt differentia I. 
The totality of the shot attempt data that our partners at lnStat Hockey collected from Wisconsin's season shows the heady two-way pivot as owing to the team's sixth-best attempt differential on the team, third-best among forwards. 
The numbers look even better after lnStat accounts for shot quality, using an expected goals metric that accounts for the frequency and location of shots. Wisconsin left with a plus-four xG differential with Holloway on the ice. 
Not bad for an 18-year-old. 
He's just got such phenomenal, mature habits. Holloway never flies the zone, consistently applies back-pressure on rush defence, pickpockets puck-carriers, makes timely hits, wields a disruptive stick -- you name it. It's everything one wants from a checking centre. 
The list of plaudits to Holloway's game on the other side of the puck is considerably shorter. He's not a pure sniper, and that's not likely to ever change. Holloway relies mostly on off the puck movements to generate his offence, lacking the puck skills to beat a defender in 1-on-1 situations or to get through heavy traffic. 
Interestingly, we've identified Holloway's eye-hand coordination as a strength though based on his ability to make contact on deflections. He's willing to take a beating to get to the spots where those deflections prove most threatening, too. 
There are some interesting quirks to his approach, certainly; a basis on which Holloway can build. He's a manipulative puck-carrier, one who works within the defensive feet-to-stick triangle at different speeds, a capable east-west attacker, and one who shields the puck from opposing defenders really, really well. 
Holloway also possesses a good read on pressure, and seems to know precisely when to dispatch of the puck. Even if he's not pulling spin-o-rama passing plays; it's comforting to know that he'I I rarely cost his team possession of the puck in the offensive zone. Live to fight another day, etc. 
You're never going to see Holloway's name atop a scoring leaderboard. It's just not going to happen. I'm not even sure it's something worth positing as a possibility in the NCAA much less the NHL. 
The more likely outcome is that Holloway continues to grow offensively in a more prominent role in Wisconsin while all the while continuing to shut it down defensively. He's the type of versatile, Swiss Army knife-type of forward every coach would love to have in their middle-six. At least, Holloway has a real chance at being that at the NHL level. ","Holloway was a top 10 candidate heading into this season, and he is higher on many lists I've seen. While he plays a strong two-way game, Holloway struggled to produce at Wisconsin. And while there is a case to be made his production isn't terrible, considering he was one of the youngest players in the NCAA, I still have a few concerns regarding his upside. Teams would be wary to take him in the top 10 unless they suspect his offense will take a big jump next season. I project him to be a middle-six forward at the NHL level.","He is dynamic skater who is powerful and explosive with his quickness. Coupled with his deception, skill and creativity, he can take over the game in a consistent manner. His transition from backwards to forwards skating is quite crisp. He has a large stride and can get up and down the ice at a fast rate. It is obvious he has that “it” factor when it comes to his elite offense, which propels him into being a cerebral 200- foot player who is both effective and flashy. He's a center who can dominate on the rush with high skill end-to-end races or get inside the paint and dig for the greasy pucks in the dirty areas. He's a well-versed passer and avid shooter who has excellent touch in both regards, delivering pucks quickly and accurately. Even if he gets into the offensive zone and loses the puck, he does not sit back and wait to get it back and aggressively forechecks. He shows this same aggressive nature in the defensive zone and is equally hungry for the puck. He uses his physicality and isn't afraid to play the body and force the opposition to corners. Works hard to play honest off the puck and has high hockey IQ and awareness to make him a danger whenever the puck is around his vicinity. Excels in the small aspects of the game and is a player who just seems to have the puck follow him around. He's the whole package."
2020,RW,74,176,41,CAR,18,Noel Gunler,"Gunler played all season up in the SHL, getting limited minutes for one of the top teams in that league. He excited folks when he scored 27 goals in 31 junior games last season. Gunler is a high-end passer and shooter. He shows great vision and patience, holding pucks and finding teammates through seams. He shows good creativity on his entries with flashes of top-end skill. He has a very hard shot and projects as a legit mid-distance shooter. The combination of his shot and vision makes him a threat inside the offensive zone and on the power play. Off the puck, his game is just OK. He is a physical player who regularly throws his weight around and can win battles versus men, however, scouts criticize his compete level and discipline at times. Gunler's skating is average as well. His stride looks good but lacks any real power.","One of the more polarizing players in this draft, Gunler is an unquestionably talented creator who has drawn criticism internally and externally (as well as from Team Sweden) for his shift-to-shift consistency, skating and commitment off the puck. And while I won't dispute some of those concerns (though I would say they're all various degrees of overstated), he also shows regular flashes of high-end skill with the puck, he's got more room to fill out, he contributed as a teenager in a top pro league, he has always dominated his peers and his defensive results were pretty impressive this season. He was a 53.9 CF% player. Lulea outscored their opponents 21-9 (70 percent) with Gunler on the ice at even strength. And he did all of his producing at even strength due to spotty power play usage (he was 17th on the team in average power play time per game at 0:47).

I would argue his straight-line skating is actually an asset. It looks a little weird. Like some others his age, he picks up his stick and pitchforks more than you would like. You'd prefer to see him extending his stick forward in one smooth north-south motion. His stride can look stunted, with his feet dragging through as well.

But he creates quite a bit of his offence off the rush and his stride improved as the year progressed. His skating regularly helps him create partial breaks or win races as he does on this late-season goal:

He starts low in his defensive zone for this late-season goal off the rush as well (and that release in motion is dangerous):

Gunler could have real value if he falls (a lot like Arthur Kaliyev did) because his reputation gets away from him.","Gunler's speed is one of the best in the 2020 NHL Draft class. He can light up the jets pretty quickly. Gunler's speed is one of the best in the 2020 NHL Draft class. He can light up the jets pretty quickly. From an aggression/physicality perspective, Gunler is not as aggressive as fellow draft eligible prospect, Lucas Raymond, but he is still is a reliable fore-checker/back-checker. All-in-all, there is a lot to like about Gunler. His speed, stride and shot are his strongest components and are only likely to get better.","A polarizing figure in this draft class, Gunler certainly has the skill to be a higher pick. Concerns about maturity and the Swedish federation's avoidance of using him at international tournaments have raised some red flags. And his usage with Lulea waned as the season wore on, and his impact seemed to head in the wrong direction. But when you look at the skill, release and potential, Gunler is a risk that teams are more likely to take in the latter half of the first round.",,"The variance in opinions on Lulea winger Noel Gunler is about as vast as Sweden's territorial holdings in 1658, with career outcomes ranging in fortune from The Battle of Narva to the Treaty of Stockholm. 
For the non-history nerds among us, the more dour of those two outcomes, the Treaty of Stockholm, is a Swedish capitulation to the coalition forces they faced in the Great Northern War, in which they surrendered many of their territorial holdings on mainland Europe, particularly in Pomerania. 
Basically, they lost their willingness to fight, and that's the first item many scouts cite as a strike against Gunler. He's not ceding territory in the literal sense but possession of the puck is another matter, or so the narrative goes. 
I mean. how else does one explain the esteem or lack thereof in which the scouting community holds Gunler? Never mind the Swedish Federation's unwillingness to use him in any capacity this year. 
This is a player that stringed together 15 relatively productive games in the SHL during his 
draft-minus-one season; one who followed it up with a 13 points in 45 games this year with Lulea's men's team. 
There's no denying his offensive gifts. Gunler plays with such finesse, such anticipation. Where most cleave through their opponents with the precision of a chainsaw while they're forechecking, Gunler picks his opponents apart as if by scalpel. 
He'll hover above the puck and pick off passes if he's the first man in or he'll wield his stick like a Hungry Hungry Hippo from just outside the scrum in support of his teammates as the F2 and leave with possession. He's not afraid of initiating contact, by any means, but it's not his go-to. 
Which brings us to one of his shortcomings -- an unwillingness to take a hit. It's a consistent theme throughout game reports. Gunler just doesn't hang in there under even modest physical duress. On the odd occasion when tries to, it's more cute than it is resilient. 
""Gunler sometimes seems stressed when he is about to get hit and throws the puck away. Clearly, it affects his decision-making negatively,"" our Dir. of European Scouting Christoffer Hedlund said of Gunler in a Player Report from this season. ""He needs to become stronger on the puck when cha I lenged by direct physical play."" 
It should come as no surprise then that Gunler creates the majority of his offence with off the puck skating patterns, the ability to find space, and relatively good timing. 
He's got a great shot, and if someone can carry the puck into the offensive zone or dig it out on retrievals for him -- watch out. The curl-and-release is a favourite of Gunler's, but that also speaks to his limitations as a sniper. He's not a true 
one-touch scorer -- the stick isn't supposed to travel against the grain of the puck if you want that label -- and generally struggles to generate power in small-ice scenarios. 
One of the real strengths of Gunler as a shooter is his shot placement. He's able to tag anywhere on net with time and space. If he integrated a little more deception into his release or wielded pre-shot movement to get the goalie going, he'd really be cooking with fire. 
If he improved as a skater, too? Now we're really talking. It's not like it can get much worse. He's got such a wide stride when he jumps from his stance, with a recovery that lands well outside his frame, and an unwillingness or inability to integrate crossovers in space. 
""His skating is ugly and he's not quick, especially in small-area situations -- wide recovery, lack of consistent extensions, and for some reason, he never uses crossovers in open ice,""  remarked in a game report. ""You'd think a player with such a flaw open-ice stride and obvious speed limitations would rely more on crossovers. Not only will crossovers allow him to get more out of his hands, it'll provide more efficient acceleration/speed generation."" 
That he can't handle the puck at the meagre speed he's generating at this stage in his development is just a little bit concerning. He'll occasiona I ly place the puck within the defensive triangle, and there are flashes of genuine ski 11, but it's hardly what we'd consider a strength. 
In the defensive zone, Gun I er is just a complete adventure. He's either completely checked out or just a little too invested. He attacks the puck-carrier in a straight line, consistently overcommits, and is easily taken out of the play. The commonality across ever Gunler performance, good and bad alike, is that he's not providing much if any value from his own zone. 
Whichever team drafts Gunler isn't going to be looking for the next Frank J. Selke trophy candidate though. They're drafting him to score goals, and there's ample evidence that he can perform that task at an absurdly high level given his age. 
It's hard to imagine a scenario where Gunler makes us look good with this ranking. He'll either explode into a top-six scoring role with utility on an NHL power play or have an illustrious European career. It's hard to imagine just about anything else. He's one of the draft's most fascinating players. ","My opinion of Gunler has changed a bit as of late. Analytics minded people tend to like him, and I did at the beginning of the year as well. However, like many players in the SWEHL this season, Gunler has struggled to produce offensively. Not only that, but he has also looked one-dimensional at times and has been just okay at international events. However, I think he does have some upside and could be a play-driver if everything comes together for him. I believe he has a higher upside than a handful of players I previously had before him, hence the bump.","If there's a shortcoming in Gunler's game, it's his skating. His top speed is fine, but not high-end by any means. He has a bit of a hunched over stance that that isn't overly efficient, but he manages to reach top speed quickly. This isn't so much a detriment to his game as much as something holding him back from being the best prospect he could be. As he fills out and adds leg strength, his skating will improve. He is not afraid of challenging the defense and he sees the ice well, setting up both forwards and defenders with accurate passes. A towering winger with a sharp mind and a deadly release on his shot. The first thing you notice when he has the puck on his stick is how fluid his game is. He handles the puck just as smoothly and confidently at top speed as he does standing still. His goal scoring ability is his calling card as he has an elite wrist shot that he can beat a goaltender with from almost anywhere. His ability to disguise his release is a true scoring threat and the puck explodes off his stick and hits the target with regularity. His defensive game is average but nothing special. He covers his point, helps in the corners when he needs to, but he could skate a little harder on the backcheck at times instead of hoping to be sprung on a breakaway. Massive potential as an offensive catalyst."
2020,C,70,178,30,DAL,19,Mavrik Bourque,"Bourque was a top scorer in the QMJHL this season, as Shawinigan's clear leading player. He's a player who gets a lot of praise for his skill and especially his hockey sense. Bourque is an elite passer. He has tremendous patience and anticipation to let plays develop, hold the puck for an extra second and find his teammates. He makes difficult plays that most other players don't see. While his passing is his clear best strength, he also has a great shot and can score from tough positions on the ice. His hands are high-end, but he has a pass-first mentality with the puck. I find instead of making a skilled move and making a hard play to the net, he likes to slow it down and look for his passing options – something that will need to improve at the quicker paces. Bourque isn't that big, but I like his compete level and that he can penalty kill. His skating is fine, but not great. He has enough quickness to get around and is agile in tight areas, but he lacks the ability to create true separation at the NHL level.","If you've followed my work this season, you'll know that Bourque has been one of my favourites in this draft. And though, I know some other evaluators who've grown quite fond of his game, this ranking is still probably in the minority (I'd expect him to be available into the late teens or maybe even the 20s). Bourque's one of those players who just plays fast. He's quick from a standstill. He's agile in high traffic. He's can play the puck into space and get to it. He reads and reacts before defenders do. And he can hang onto the puck to make a play but he can also cut past them and throw a pass back against the grain in a flash. He has consistently made high-end plays without high-end players around him. And his production is in line with many of the CHL players who will likely be selected in front of him. He's not particularly explosive for his size and that may limit his NHL upside, but you don't have to be the fastest player on the ice to play like you're the fastest player on the ice.","All-in-all, Bourque is quality playmaker, who thrives under pressure and finds the smallest gaps in the offensive zone to distribute the puck through. But, he is not just an excellent passer as he has a booming shot too.  The main challenge for Bourque is something that we discussed earlier. Mobility. In the defensive zone, you need to have strong mobility when puck tracking. Given Bourque's wide glide, there are moments where he loses track of the puck and moments where he is a bit slow to the puck.","Among U18 players in the QMJHL, no player had more points than Bourque's 71 -- and his 1.45 points per game led his age peers by a substantial margin. He has some natural offensive ability, with an excellent shot, especially off the pass. Bourque doesn't have an imposing frame, but he has quick hands and a good idea of how to spin the wheels offensively for his team. I think his skating could stand to improve, but it's not a major drawback for him.",,"No two scouts share the same opinion of our draft guide's next subject, Shawinigan Cataractes centre Mavrik Bourque. 
""I cannot believe how high you guys rated Bourque,"" was a common refrain when I'd pass on our rankings to scouts across the NHL. ""Bourque takes way too many nights off"" was another. 
The tone changed significantly when one broached Bourque to his coaches, teammates, etc. 
""I really liked Mavrik Bourque,"" Team Canada head coach Michael Dyck told EliteProspects at the 2019 Hlinka-Gretzky Cup when asked who was the unsung hero of the team."" 
""His skill level is at a high, high-level,"" Team Russia centre told EliteProspects at the World Junior A Challenge in Dawson Creek. ""Right now, I can tell you he's a great player with a bright future."" the general manager for the Cataractes in the OMJHL. offered a paean for the 18-year-old pivot when our Dir. of North American Scouting  spoke to him over the phone at about the midway point in the season.
""I've known Mav for a year and a half, and last year was pretty hard for us because we were young, young, young, and at 16, he was already that go-to guy. I trust Mav like no one else. His hockey 10 is unreal. I've been in the O for the last seven years, and he has the best hockey IQ I've seen. Out of nothing, he's going to make plays that no one else can see on the ice. 
""And, even though he's not physically mature -- there's still some improvement to be made there, like physically getting stronger -- I love the way he protects the puck. He's very effective at putting the puck at the proper space so he can protect the puck. Then, making contact and then spin to create space; he's going to use the opponent to create space on the ice. He's always going to wait to bring one or two players on him; if there's only one player on him, he's getting more and more patient with the puck -- and he's getting more and more effective at it. As soon as he feels two or three players are getting sucked in at him, then, he's going to make a play. And obviously, it's going to be a scoring chance."" 
""He's so good at bringing [defenders] to him. On the powerplay, he's very effective, and on the PK, too, which is very impressive for an offensive player. My job now is to limit or control his ice time, because I'd play him on first line, first PP, first PK, first 5-on-5, big faceoffs -- I'd put him everywhere on the ice. But he's 17, and we get to play 68-plus games, so, right now, he's playing the PP for sure, and he's more at the end of the PK, like third PK unit, but he can play both special teams and be very, very effective.""
Mavrik Bourque, it's a land of contrasts. There's the gist of it. 
Clearly, we find ourselves landing on the side of Bourque's teammates and coaches most often. Whether that comes back to bite us in the ass or not remains to be seen, but that's par for the course at the draft. 
So much of what Renaud, in particular, had to say about Bourque's game resonates with our assessment. 
It all starts upstairs for Bourque. He's the master manipulator, blending layers of deception one on top of the other, duping the opposition into sheer disarray at every turn. 
There's no tell on his shot. Bourque can generate a tonne of power through his wrist shot even when it's well outside his frame, and he doesn't need a big wind-up to do it. He's got a wide array of releases and avails himself of the best one for any given moment. If that's not enough, he wields the threat of a shot as a means of drawing opponents into his space before dispatching of the puck to a teammate who's just gained valuable real estate as a result. 
He's an able distributor with a thorough mental map of the ice that a I lows him to find teammates in smal I-ice and big-ice scenarios alike. With the occasional head fake or a change of speed; he's shown a real knack for thinking defencemen out of passing lanes and exploiting their lack of discretion. 
There aren't any real dynamic qualities to Bourque's game as a handler, but he makes do in tight spaces by reading incoming pressure and reacting accordingly, rarely overhand ling the puck and often finding a way to problem-solve his way out of a corner. 
One of the big questions concerning Bourque's game is what happens once he enters the defensive zone. 
The scouts we've spoken to over the course of the year have less than no time for Bourque's defensive coverage or his work rate. It's the major source of much of their skepticism. 
We're not projecting any Selke trophies in Bourque's future, but he's a pretty smart off of the puck player in the defensive third. He consistently tracks well through the neutral zone and applies back-pressure more often than not. 
It's the work rate that we can't contest. We'd love to see Bourque apply himself more consistently in the defensive zone and work harder on 50/50 pucks. We've seen him flat-out give up on plays far, far too often. 
Was Bourque pacing himself? It's a worthwhile question. The data that our friends at InStatHockey accumulated from Bourque's season have him playing more than any other first-time draft-eligible skater in the CHL not named Alexis Lafreniere. 
Similarly, one can't help but wonder what would happen to Bourque on another, deeper, more offensively skilled team. How much of Bourque's production can be chalked up to opportunity? Would he play more of a secondary role on a deeper team? 
Even so, these are minor quibbles given the skill level and hockey sense that Bourque brings to the table. He's a true 
dual-threat scorer with top-six centre upside at the NHL level. ","Bourque is a player that has grown on me all season, particularly due to his spike in offense. Bourque looked like a solid second or third-line center when the season started due to his excellent defensive awareness and two-way play. However, Bourque has shown that he too has a higher offensive ceiling than I once thought. Averaging well over a point per game, Bourque looks like a two-way, second-line center who can produce points as well.  ","A smart two-way forward, he is an agile and speedy skater who plays an energetic game and is always looking to be creative with the puck. He skates with bent knees and is ready to dart in any direction to compete with a defender or jump into open ice to support a teammate. He constantly displays quality edgework and has a beautiful spin-move. With the puck, he is a dangerous distributor with a sense for where ice will open and for finding the passing lanes to get the puck there. The centerman will pick up a tap pass, spin in the neutral zone and dump the puck into the offensive zone. When in heavy traffic, he can still circle around his opponents and go from zone-to-zone without coughing up the puck. He has good passing abilities and he tends to stay involved in the play. Willing to put the effort in at both ends of the ice, he creates many turnovers and is very responsible defensively. His active stick and agile stance enabled him to quickly react to his opponents' movements in his defensive zone and regain possession of the puck, which he can promptly bring back down the ice for an offensive scoring chance. He is a strong, balanced prospect with a methodical approach to his game. His confidence allows him to make sound decisions with and without the puck. He rarely forces a play and while he isn't overly physical, he will do what it takes."
2020,RW,71,192,27,ANA,20,Jacob Perreault,"Perreault scored 39 goals in 57 OHL games after scoring 30 goals as a 16-year-old in the OHL. Perreault is a dynamic player. He makes elite plays and has one of the best shots in this draft. He can be so dangerous on a power play with his shot and pick corners from a distance, but he's also a tremendous passer who makes unique plays. His hands are top of the line, and he shows a ton of confidence with the puck, attacking defenders consistently with his skill and looking to make things happen. Inside the offensive zone there are no questions about what he can do. Scouts have questions on his foot speed and whether he will provide enough off the puck to continue to score at the higher levels. I don't see him killing penalties in the NHL, but I think there's enough compete in his game to maximize his scoring potential as I've seen him win battles versus bigger players and make plays in the hard areas. His footspeed is certainly average, but given his tremendous skill, vision and finishing ability, he can be 5-foot-11 with average feet and still be a very good NHL player.","Perreault has mystified me over the last two years. There are stretches in games where he can look slow from a standstill and a little heavy-footed. There are others where, once he gets moving, he shows some real speed and can burn defenders. There are shifts where he looks competitive and engaged off the puck and others where he gets caught looking a little too passive. On talent, he should be more than he is – and higher on my board, given the things I tend to look for in a player. He's got one of the better shots in the draft (behind Holtz and Quinn but few others). It pops off his stick and cleanly beats goalies consistently. It's also among the most accurate shots in the draft. Perreault is the king of finishing up high from tough angles like this one:

Or this one:

But he forces plays too often and I worry some of his junior hockey flashes won't translate. He just leaves me wanting more than he should and he can look off good options to try to get into scoring positions that aren't there. He could be a player I regret not having 10 spots higher but I'll stand by this assessment. He has some work to do.",,"Among the best pure goal scorers in this class, Perreault has an elite shot. His one-timers are deadly, and he changes up his release points on his shot often, which makes him much more deceptive for opposing goalies. Consistency of effort and play away from the puck continue to be areas scouts harp on about Perreault's overall projection, but the scoring ability keeps the son of former NHLer Yanic Perreault in the top 20.",,"Everyone knew about Sarnia Sting forward Jacob Perreault's shot and two-way credibility coming into this season. 
The 30 goals Perreault scored on a middling Sting team in his draft-minus-one season stand as his bona tides as a sniper. The plus-four goal differential at 5-on-5 is a nice feather in his cap as a difference-maker territorially, too. 
It's why his absence on the Canadian roster at 2019 Hlinka-Gretzky Cup in Czechia puzzled so many scouts -- they sure could've used his scoring punch in the Gold Medal Game. 
Whether Perreault used that snub as motivation or not -- who can say? There's no denying his hot start to the OHL season though, lighting the lamp twice on opening night en route to six goals through his first ten games. 
That was just a sign of things to come. Perreault finished the year one short of the 40-goal mark, and added a handful of assists over last season in six fewer games. 
He's a pure sniper with one of the best shots in his entire draft class, as noted by the eight shooting grade that our OHL scout Rachel Doerrie meted to the Sarnia product. 
This segment from a player report Doerrie wrote in November does a good job of detailing the extent of his arsenal. 
""Perreault has one of the best shots in this draft class. It's accurate, hard and he can score from anvwhere. He can score from both sides off of the rush, one-timers, quick shots off of faceoffs, and off of rebounds in front of the net. His nose for the net and quick hands in tight make him a threat from anywhere in the offensive zone. His ability to catch and shoot pucks in stride when the passes aren't in the wheelhouse is a transferable skill that will serve him well."" 
The backhand shot -- a long lost art-form -- is just another feather in Perreau It's game and one he uses to catch goaltenders off guard from time-to-time. My personal favourite is when he drops the shoulder as if to give the appearance of protecting the puck, only to let a backhand shot off right as the goaltender's let their guard down. Even if there wasn't a massive jump in assists: we've identified Perreault's playmaking as an area of growth this season. ""His 
distribution skills have improved,"" Doerrie remarked. ""He's making the players around him better because of the scoring chances he's creating."" 
Still, there is room for growth. ""He can control defenders, but sometimes misses slot-cutting teammates or better positioned ones on the flank as he tries to dangle too many defenders,""  remarked in a game report. ""He could also become guilty of forcing passes at the next level as defenders better anticipate what he wil I do next."" 
There's some debate over how to rate Perreault's skating though. That's less clear to our staff. There are mechanical 
inconsistencies in the way he covers the ice, particularly in the stutters that often arise in his crossovers. His stride recovery There weren't many strong puck-carriers on Sarnia -- Ryan McGregor had moments, I guess? That meant that Perreault took on a massive burden in transition, and he handled it with aplomb. The numbers that  collected from the 
CHL+USNTDP U18 team this season place Perreault in the top-quartile for all three of the entry statistics his project accounts for -- controlled entries per hour, controlled entries relative percentage, and successful controlled entries relative percentage. 
It's fair to wonder how much of his production can be attributed to playing on a Sting team that absolutely, undeniably played a system that was perfectly suited to his style -- or the absence of a system, depending on your mileage. Doesn't just about every prospect come with their own contextual question marks though? 
lands a bit high and wide, limiting his acceleration in space. 
Even so, Perreault achieves the desirable flexion at all three points, and he's got a great deal of lower-body strength. too. 
I've seen Perreault accelerate as if shot from a cannon and just explode up-ice at a breakneck pace. I haven't seen it often, 
but I've definitely seen it. Perreault's pathway to imrpovement as skater is pretty straightforward. Everything else, and his shot especially, is at a relateively high level. He has all the makings of a top-six scorer if he continues to develop at this rate.","Scouts are all over the place on Perreault, even though he has shown he can produce offensively in the past. Perreault is a pure goal-scorer but is an above-average passer as well. His point totals suggest any question marks surrounding his offensive game and skating can be put aside. He looks, at worst, like a middle-six goal-scoring winger, and at best a top six.","Creative winger with well-rounded offensive instincts and skill, Perreault shows tremendous anticipation and vision with the puck on his stick and can navigate around defenders in traffic with ease thanks to his exceptional timing, smooth skating, quick crossovers and speedy reflexes. While his skating isn't at an elite level and he doesn't have a lot of jump off the top, he is strong on his skates and does a nice job of moving the puck when he gets going. Has a strong shot with high power and a quick release, which he relies on heavily as he likes to set up down low for one-timer opportunities. He also does a nice job of moving the puck and keeping the play alive with sharp and accurate passes when the shooting opportunities aren't there. He identifies passing lanes and makes crisp passes, but he isn't one to dazzle as a distributor. He has some bouts of inconsistency, but when he is fully engaged, he is often the most dangerous player on the ice. His effort also lacks at times in his own end, but he generally gets his stick into the passing lanes and has the skill to win loose puck battles and races. He uses his sturdy frame to box players out of board battles or in front of the net. Overall, he is a dangerous goal scorer when engaged and if he puts forward a consistent effort in all areas of his game, he will be a great offensive addition."
2020,C,70,175,48,MON,21,Jan Mysak,"Mysak generated buzz when he made his Czech pro team as a 16-year-old and held his own. This season he looked good but not spectacular versus men, and, after a solid world juniors (especially for a U20) he came to the OHL and was very good in the second half. Mysak checks a lot of things you want in a hockey player. He's quick, he's skilled, he can make difficult plays and he can score goals. He's also a competitive two-way forward who can kill penalties and win battles. I do have a mild upside question given he's not that big and lacks truly high-end skill, Mysak has had a lot of games I've seen over the years where he's just not that impactful offensively and fades into the background. Even if he's not a game-breaker at that size, he has enough elements to his game that he could make it and help a team.","The more I watched Mysak as the year progressed, the more I fell in love with his skill set. He's got pop to his game that almost all of the players ranked after him lack. After putting together some spectacular age-adjusted seasons in the Czech Republic, he stepped into the OHL and became a dynamic goal-scoring threat quickly, even if you account for his 22 percent shooting percentage as unsustainable. He plays a straight-line game that could probably use more of an east-west element (particularly in the way he involves his teammates) but he can crack open a shift with the puck on his stick, he's quick from a standstill and he does a wonderful job finding soft spots in the offensive zone to get open. Watch below how he rotates off his defender and swings from behind the net to the slot. He does a great job drifting away from pressure before sneaking back into it and finishing high off his backhand:

And though his game off the puck still needs work, I think he handled the adjustment to his defensive responsibilities on the smaller ice fine. It bears mentioning that the Bulldogs struggled as a whole defensively this season, so it's no surprise that there were some growing pains for him.","Some scouts have criticised his skating, but there is no doubting his speed, and alongside his hockey IQ his skating is amongst his best attributes. The concerns though center more around the “process” of his skating than results though. Myšák is a great goalscorer. Both from wing and when he has played down the middle. His skill and speed allow him to get the advantage through the neutral zone, his hard forechecking style ensure he is rarely far from the puck, and his hockey-IQ allows him to get in great positions to score. ","Mysak made the jump from Czech professional hockey to the OHL, and it allowed him a better opportunity to showcase his full set of skills. Mysak is a very strong skater with good offensive instincts. He averaged over a point per game with Hamilton, and there is some two-way value, as he shows good effort at both ends of the ice. Mysak does a lot of things well but doesn't have many elite traits.",,"Why not start the second-round with a bang, by leading with one of the draft's most polarizing prospects, Hamilton Bulldogs centre Jan Mysak. 
His statistical profile, at least coming into this season, was the sort that commands first-round attention, at the very least, and a spot in the first 15 picks most often. 
Mysak's seven points in 31 contests represent the 14th-best season by a draft-minus-one skater in the Czech men's league, and it's the fifth-highest point-per-game rate in the last 20 years. 
Even the first-half of Mysak 's draft-year in the Czech Extraliga held promise; his point-per-game rate is in the top-five among first-time draft-eligible skaters in the league's last 20 years and compares closely to Carolina Hurricanes centre Martin Necas at the same age. 
You'll be hard-pressed to find someone in the game who rates Mysak accordingly though. ""You'd use a first-round pick on that guy? I don't see any high-end tools and he's only an average skater,"" a Western Conference scout told us in December. 
Some of the industry sources we consulted with told us they wouldn't even bother using a second-round pick on Mysak. 
We're a bit more bullish on Mysak than many of the scouts we spoke with. There's a nice collection of skills in his game, and he's a great kid with an unrelenting motor. 
 summed it up pretty well in a game report from February, saying of Mysak, ""he has some projectable offensive elements -- vision, ability as a passer off the rush, and the ability to pick corners, but he will need a lot of change to his game if he wants to play in the NHL."" 
He's a north-south attacker, one who skates a fair bit better in our estimation than the league gives credit, but a fairly rudimentary one at that. Mysak often attacks in a straight line, doesn't often integrate the dot-I ine, and doesn't set up his maneuvers especiaIly welI -- it's a very meat and potatoes style of attacking. Another area where Mysak excels in the offensive zone is as a forechecker. He takes smart routes to the puck, funnels opposition defenders towards support, and anticipates play well generally. 
It's when offensive zone possessions become more static that his abi I ity to impact the game wanes. Mysak 's not an especially mobile player off of the puck, and he often struggles to find his linemates consistently as a distributor, much less connect on difficult passes through layers. 
There's no denying Mysak's statistical profile -- it's pretty special. Then again, so was Pavel Zacha's going into his 
draft-year. The New Jersey Devils would probably feel a lot better about Zacha if they took him 32nd-overall rather than sixth. 
You'll hear a lot from certain more statistically-inclined corners of the hockey world that Mysak has a high-ceiling, but we're not convinced of as much. That's okay. You're not going to find many first-line calibre talents at this point in the draft. 
The long-term play with Mysak is likely that of a third-line checking winger with penalty killing value. ","Mysak made the jump to the OHL at the midway point of the season. After struggling to produce in the Czech Republic against men, I was curious to see what he could do against his peers. Mysak hasn't disappointed. Mysak is a speedy forward who loves to create offense off the rush. He also has excellent hands and an uncanny ability to throttle his speed to confuse defenders. He is a unique player and is fearless in tight. I see him as a scoring winger at the NHL level.","An energetic winger who can make an impact with his speed, tencity and quickness. He moves through the offensive zone fluidly, finding open ice to create dangerous scoring chances. His shot is high-end with a lightning-quick release and he can change the angle with his unique puck work. His hands are quick and controlled, both in-tight and with space, which allows him to open passing and shooting lanes.  Although he is not the biggest forward, he is good at finding ways to the net through traffic. Quick and shifty with the puck, he can change directions quickly and will make opposing teams pay if given the space due to his quick hands and slick puck skills. He brings loads of energy and an intense compete level to the game and constantly keeps his feet moving, which makes him a dangerous forechecker. Sometimes he wants to be too involved, which takes a lot of energy, but his work ethic is always on display. He always wants the puck on his stick, which makes him dangerous in the neutral zone as well. He protects the puck well through the middle of the ice and is tenacious on loose pucks when he doesn't have it.  In his own end, he can sometimes get out of position and lose his man but when he has the puck, he protects it well. A player that understands the game extremely well, possesses high hockey IQ and isn't afraid to get physical."
2020,D,74,186,16,MON,22,Kaiden Guhle,"Guhle was the No. 1 pick in his WHL Bantam Draft, and after a limited role in 2018-19, he emerged as a top defenseman in his age group this season. Guhle is appealing because of his physical attributes. He's 6-foot-2, he skates quite well and he knocks opponents off the puck with high frequency. His gap control is excellent, closing on checks with force and showing a preference for playing the body. The question on Guhle will be how much offense he has and whether he can move the puck at the NHL level even after his 40 point season. I think he can, but with the caveat that he's not an NHL power play type. He has enough skill and IQ to make a good pass, and he shows some creativity off the offensive blue line. He can create more with his feet than with his skill.","When I was doing the reporting for my story on Carter Savoie and Mike Benning, their trainer Barry Butt, who also works with the Guhle brothers and Blackhawks 2019 third overall pick Kirby Dach, went out of his way to highlight Kaiden Guhle's freakish athleticism in the gym. In a group of the world's top young players, he stands above the rest. If you've watched Guhle closely, this shouldn't surprise you. He's one of the smoothest-skating defencemen in the class and he's pushes opposing players around along the wall (and occasionally the rush). Concerns about his skill level kept him out of my top 31 (he has a heavy shot but he's not a playmaker and his handling still needs a bit of work when he's working in small areas) but Guhle will be a first-rounder and I wouldn't fault a team for taking him in the late teens or early 20s. While I don't see power play upside, his defensive game is already pretty refined. Guhle's skating is going to be an asset at the NHL level – he can probably stand to get even stronger without sacrificing it – and if he can build upon a decent but unspectacular foundation offensively, he could become a second-pairing guy.","Guhle is a physically gifted defensemen. He delivers booming hits in all three zones and is easily the best physical defenseman in the 2020 NHL Entry Draft class. If Guhle can work on his shot and work with a power skating instructor on widening his stride, he could be dominant in the NHL one day.","One of the draft's most athletic players, Guhle is an especially mobile defenseman who packs a punch. The concern about the younger brother of NHL defenseman Brendan Guhle is in his overall offensive upside. But his full complement of tools -- with skating and hockey sense being among his best -- gives me reason to believe he can and will progress offensively. This season, he improved his scoring from the previous campaign by 23 points. Guhle also has a nice quick shot from the point, which helped him score 11 goals. At this stage of the draft board, there are fewer and fewer sure bets, but I'd take a chance on the athleticism, skating and size that Guhle offers.",,"The year-over-year progress from Kaiden Guhle's draft-minus-one season to his first-year of draft-eligibility was stark, and he announced as much from the start of the scouting season. 
I could hardly believe the Guhle I was watching patrol the blue line for Team Canada at the Hlinka-Gretzky Cup. He was aggressive, physical, decisive, and quick on his feet. 
There were some nights where Guhle outplayed Jamie Drysdale even. And in the games where he didn't; Guhle was always full-value from an entertainment perspective. 
""Our guys have been super impressed with Guhle,"" one front office staffer told me via text during the Hlinka-Gretzky. ""I thought he was fucking awful last year, but I might have to circle back here."" 
It's good to know I wasn't the only one that noticed. 
That was just the amuse-bouche for a spectacular draft-year on Guhle's part, one which saw him rise from a likely second-round prospect to a surefire first-rounder. 
The first thing anyone notices with Gu hie is what a powerful, graceful skater he is. It's something that  accounted for in his player report on the Prince Albert Raiders blue liner. 
""Guhle boasts two-step acceleration and separation: strings together fully extended crossovers and strides continuously: fully torsioned cuts and turns allows for close-quarters separation; explosive in open ice."" 
It must run in the family. Brendan Guhle, Kaiden's older brother and an Anaheim Ducks defenceman, has always had that part of the game down pat. 
That's about where the similarities between the two end though. Kaiden is a much more forceful player, one fully capable of taking over a game at any given moment. It's rare, but something I've seen enough times to trust. 
I've seen him construct an end-to-end rush - - live, no less - - to seal a Prince Albert win in overtime against the Edmonton Oil Kings; I've also seen him singlehandedly end an opposition cycle and execute the breakout on more times than I can remember. 
He's physically imposing in the most literal sense. 
To hear  describe it, ""Guhle is an absolute menace when he's on. He punishes straight-line rushes along the boards 
with regularity; closes out shots/passes with speed."" 
It's that last line that really sticks out. Many defenders at this age stop moving their feet whenever they close on their opponent, particularly in open-ice scenarios. That's not the case at all with Guhle. He's constantly moving his feet, closing 
through challenges, closing on his opponent as the puck lands on his stick, closing on his opponent as they're going through 
their shot. He's also the best transition defender this side of Jake Sanderson. Guhle closes with such speed and force, regularly dispossessing his opponent of the puck right at the defensive blue line, and making it look easy in the process. 
As one might suspect at this point, Guhle is a one-man breakout. It all starts with strong habits on defensive zone puck retrievals. He identifies pressures, selects his escape route, and sells deception upon collecting the puck, and seamlessly transitions up-ice. 
That's when Guhle's limitations start to reveal themselves though -- once he's entered the offensive zone. The fact remains that his puck skills just do not rate highly, not in this class, not among WHL defenders, or in any capacity, really. He struggles to corral difficult passes, has a tendency to lead with the puck, keeps his hands and feet on the same beat, and tends to fumble the puck a fair bit. 
It's not like he has a booming point shot to lean back on either. Gu hie does a good job of getting pucks through traffic and on-goal, but they're never especially threatening. He's not a particularly adept distributor either. Guhle regularly misses cross-ice opportunities and the variance in quality from one pass to the next is all over the place. 
Mostly, Guhle creates by activating off of the rush or joining the second-wave of the attack. That's where his strengths lie. 
The physical toolkit with Guhle really is as tantalizing as it gets. He's going to bring tremendous value to the NHL level in a top-four role playing difficult shutdown minutes, and should feature prominently on his team's penalty kill. He'll need to improve his decision-making -- that's still a problem -- and working on his puck skills couldn't hurt, but those are minor quibbles. There's a lot to like here. ","Kaiden Guhle is a player I have gone back and forth on all season.  Ultimately, I have landed on the fourth on his ceiling and development.  Guhle is a borderline throwback type defenseman.  He is physical and excels at defending down low.  I had questions surrounding his offensive ceiling and whether or not his overall game could project to at least a second-pairing defender at the NHL level.  However, I do see the tools, including speed, that could land Guhle as a top-four defender if everything goes swimmingly.  He is likely to go in the top 20 thanks to his physical tool kit and a lack of defensive prospects available.","He's such an impressive skater for a defenseman of his size. His hip flexibility, strong edges and long stride give him incredible range across the ice in any direction. A beast of a player who skates among the best in the West, he showcases a raw power and finesse that allows him to be an explosive rush option. While his transitions could use some work, that should be cleaned up when he adds more strength to his lower body. He plays with a physical style that allows him to head off a lot of entries in the neutral zone and court opponents consistently into checks or into giveaways by offering an intimidating and tactical presence defending the rush. He's aggressive in coverage and challenges players quickly, which often ends up in play being swallowed up and back on his stick looking to counterattack. He is a commanding presence on the back end. Offensively, he has good hands, manages pucks well with a strength and softness but doesn't play with a lot of flair or creativity. He shows flashes of an added offensive streak but so far isn't a consistent force offensively. He makes crisp outlet passes and simple reads but can get frantic when pressured which sometimes leads to being caught out of position. Additionally, he has some undisciplined moments that he will need to curb. His overall hockey sense is good but needs to be better and he needs to reign in his aggressiveness and watch the puck less."
2020,D,74,202,29,NYR,23,Braden Schneider,"Schneider may not overly excite you upon an initial look at his stats, and it's taken me a while to come around to him, but he's grown on me a lot over the past two seasons. I see a player with a lot of assets and few holes in his skill set. He's a 6-foot-2, right-handed defenseman who can skate well. He can rush pucks and close gaps well. Schneider moves the puck very well out of the defensive zone, showing great vision and patience on his outlets. He defends well due to his feet, but also doesn't shy away from playing the body and knocking players off pucks. He has some offensive blue line touch, but he's probably not going to be a power play guy in the NHL. He moves it at a clear NHL level, though, to where I think he could take a regular even strength shift and help his team's possession game without needing to be sheltered by his coach.","In his own zone, Schneider's one of the better defensive defencemen in this draft. He uses his length and strength well off the rush, too, but his biggest asset is his ability to take away time and space in the defensive zone, close out the wall, win puck battles and advance the play back up ice with a quick outlet. After three full seasons in the WHL, I would've liked to see a little more out of his puck game to rank him in the first round (where he will likely be picked), though. He has a hard point shot when he uses it but I would like to see him attack off the line more than he does. He's closer to turning pro than most and will be a penalty killer at the pro level, which some of these others will not be, but next year will be big for his development and I'll be watching closely to see if he can create at a higher, more consistent level. His skating is fine for his size and won't hold him back, but I wouldn't say it's a huge asset either. I fear that a lot of his success stems from his physical maturity, which will become less of an asset against pros.","Schneider is not just a player who excels without the puck though. He has a solid core skill-set when it comes to moving the puck the other way. He is a crisp passer who outlets well, and can also skate out of the zone if needed. Additionally, he can jump into the rush, and is a good judge of when to pinch on a play. He has a big slap-shot as well when he gets into position to unleash it.

While naturally the above is enough to get both those who long for the 1990s back, as well as those who value out-lets and blue-line defense, both salivating, Schneider is not without his issues. Despite having a good gap and IQ, Schneider's predilection for taking the body means he takes himself out of plays often. It is no use being good around your net and having a good gap when you are lying on top of a player with their team 2v1 behind you.

However, the main reason he is not a sure-fire top 20 or so pick? It is difficult at times to see exactly where the upside is to make him more than a solid second pairing defenseman. He struggles to be creative in the offensive zone, and while he can get up into the rush plays can die on his stick when there. On the cycle he generally does little more than facilitate the play of others, rarely manages to contribute to a play unless at the point, and his hands are no more than average with the puck on his stick.

Still, that skill-set is nothing to sniff at, and can be very valuable in the modern NHL, especially considering he is a righty as the league goes more and more towards balancing handedness on defensive pairings. While his upside might not be as high as the majority of potential first rounders he could certainly be a good pick-up towards the end of the first round, and maybe a steal if he somehow falls into the second, as unlikely as that is.","A confident defender who can throw his weight around, Schneider offers predictability in a good way: You're going to get consistent effort and good competitiveness. I really like the way he plays between the dots. He can control the net front both physically and with excellent anticipation. Schneider always seems to find himself in the right position, making good reads in the defensive zone and keeping a good gap on the rush. The offensive elements of his game are more understated, but he jumps into plays and distributes well.",,"From one defensive defenceman to the next; our 29th-ranked prospect is Brandon Wheat Kings rearguard Braden Schneider. 
This punishing defender brings an impressive, lengthy resume to the table. Because he's a September birthdate -- Schneider is just five days removed from being eligible for the 2019 draft -- this year represented his third season in the WHL. 
The first thing anyone notices with Schneider is the NHL-ready frame that he boasts, standing tall over most of his WHL competition this year at 6-foot-2 and 209 pounds. Only nine skaters boast a higher physical grade than the 7 that  meted to the Prince Albert native. 
Here is what , our Dir. of North American Scouting, had to say about Schneider's physicality in a player report he authored in March. 
""He is an absolute behemoth of a dude at this level, imposing his will with thunderous hits, overpowering one-hand pushes, and crosschecks. He's composed, and doesn't over-do the physicality or take needless penalties; enters every hit with his stick leading, and doesn't hit unless he can't break up the play otherwise."" 
It starts with strong defensive habits through the neutral zone. Schneider keeps play in front of him, never commits too early or overcommits, and does an excellent job of guiding the 
puck-carrier to the outside, leading with his stick, and moving his feet through each thunderous check. 
This approach can appear passive at times -- especially relative to the likes of a Kaiden Gu hie, or worse still, Jeremie Poirier -- but it's a calculated gambit on Schneider's part. The Wheat Kings forwards don't offer the neutral zone support necessary for him to deploy a more aggressive posture. 
In the defensive zone, Schneider really turns it up another level -- it's easily the third of the ice where he's most comfortable. ""He's a switchable on/off-puck defender with help instincts and one-on-one skills,""  said in his player report. He uses timed stick tie-ups against surrounding players, and is extremely vocal (it's not just evident from the press box, either)."" When Schneider is at the top of his game, he brings that one-man cycle-disrupting edge, singlehandedly ending offensive zone possession for the opposition. It's not something that shows up in every viewing but it's absolutely within his means. 
He's a rapacious fiend on defensive zone puck retrievals too, quickly activating on rebounds and leveraging himself between it and the nearest opposition forward. On dump-and-chase retrievals, Schneider quickly pivots, scans the defensive zone, plans his escape route, then quickly and decisively acts once the puck is on his stick. 
Now we're starting to step towards the part of Schneider's game that give us reasons for pause. Perhaps it's a sampling issue, but we're more concerned about his transition decision-making than most. This is particularly true on the backhand. where Schneider is a capable handler but tends to put himself and his teammates in trouble with ill-advised attempts through the middle of the ice. 
There's a reason that I qualified that bit of analysis by acknowledging the possibility of a sampling issue. This is always the case. Find me a scout -- particularly in the public sphere - - who professes to have seen every single one of a draft-eligible skater's games and you've found a liar. 
In this case, most of the scouts with which we've broached Schneider's game tend to think that this isn't much of an issue if one at all. Perhaps the sample of games we've seen isn't indicative of Schneider's true talent level or competence? 
Sampling variance is something one has to be wary of with any player but when the pushback to what one is seeing is this strong. it's worth mentioning. The sample of data that  collected from the Wheat Kings' season, 13 games worth, shows Schneider as generating a high volume of exits, but very few of those are possession-retaining relative to his teammates. Put another way: Schneider bears the brunt of his team's breakout burden but converts on very few of those attempts relative to his teammates. Those numbers pretty much drop across the board when it comes time for Schneider to take the puck across the offensive blue line. 
When his team has established offensive zone possession, Schneider really starts to take a backseat. He rates in the bottom-half of the CHL and USNTDP in expected goal generation, and his shot assists per hour are only in the 55th percentile -- even so, Schneider is in the 89th percentile generating expected assists, in fairness. 
""Schneider lacks problem-solving skills on the point; he fails to recognize better options than the immediate one,""  said in his player report. ""He's unable to adapt to changing circumstances despite plus-level tools."" 
There might be some untapped potential there. Schneider maintains close proximity to the offensive blue line, and doesn't often activate often off of the rush. These seem like relatively straightforward ways to create offensive value. 
He's got a quick release on his shot too, but we don't see it often enough for it to be a real threat. 
The long-term play for a team drafting Schneider is probably one centred on aiming for a robust second-pairing defenceman with two-way credibility mostly generated by his play in the defensive zone and on the penalty kill. ",,"A defensive defenseman, Schneider may not produce eye-popping numbers, but his game keeps flourishing. While doesn't have the high-end elusiveness to his game you get from some of the top end puck movers, he has added some more diverse elements to his game and is strong on his edges, which makes him elusive under pressure and he is skilled with the puck. He is a strong skater who has a wide track stance that generates a pile of power, which helps him pace play.  He always keeps his feet moving to stay elusive in transition while making sharp and snappy passes to his teammates. He is defensively stout and relies on his superior positioning, strength and stickwork to neutralize opponents. He has the combination of quickness and mobility to erase pass and skating lanes and goes for the body over the puck but also keeps an active and well-timed stick. He is excellent in breaking out and transitioning pucks and is growing his game significantly inside the offensive line, showing patience and strong passing tactics to generate high quality scoring opportunity for teammates and shot opportunities for himself. He doesn't always a killer instinct as a triggerman but has come a long way in developing a respectable and consistent shot, though it is still evolving in terms of precision and power. He displays periodic flashes in his game that predicts he may become more of an offensive contributor, but he is still sorting out the mental aspects of the game and building confidence in this regard."
2020,C,71,179,22,WSH,24,Hendrix Lapierre,"Lapierre is an extremely difficult player to slot right now. He was a top player at 16. He had one of the best Hlinka Gretzky tournaments ever. Then the season started and he was good, but not great with only two goals on the season when healthy. He's a highly skilled and intelligent player. He makes a lot of tough plays, projects to run a pro power play due to very high hockey IQ and has the great individual skill to be slippery in open ice. He's a fine skater but his game could use more speed. Some scouts agree with me on the pace of his game, but some like his quickness. Lapierre was initially diagnosed with three concussions in a 10-month span, but Lapierre told The Athletic a specialist diagnosed him with twisted vertebrae in his neck that he thinks caused concussion-like symptoms. Whether it was a head or neck injury, or a combination, NHL teams, even in light of the neck injury diagnosis, are significantly concerned about Lapierre's health and the risk in his projection. His game was just OK off the puck, and he didn't attack the net that much, but it's hard to know whether that's how he plays or whether the injuries caused hesitancy. Toward the end of the season he was able to practice with the team, but his last game was in November.","I don't have a lot new to offer here over any of my previous lists because there are no updated viewings on Lapierre, who lost his season due to repeated concussion troubles. Before injuries brought the future of his career into question, Lapierre was a top-15 talent in this draft, maybe even top 10. He's a puck-dominant carrier who can transport the puck up the ice (or across it) with a sharp pass through a seam or his feet and hands. He's the kind of player every team wants running their power play. And when he doesn't have the puck, he'll chase it down to get it back and keep offensive zone sequences aside. The team that takes him will have to do their homework on his health, though, and there will still be a chance he never gets back to being himself. He lost a crucial year in every young player's development. The good news is that the season's cancellation levelled the playing field a little. Hopefully, it gives him enough time to get himself right without having the pressure that comes with getting back on the ice.","In the offensive zone, Lapierre is a dynamic passer. In addition, Lapierre is a solid stick-handler. Given that Lapierre is strong in transition, he can also deliver on the rush/breakaway. In terms of Lapierre's shot, he simply is not known for it. Aside from stick-handling and his shot, I would like to see Lapierre improve his defensive play. He is far from aggressive, so you will not often see Lapierre back check. ","Concussion and neck problems potentially derailed a season that got off to a spectacular start at the Hlinka Gretzky Cup. By the time Lapierre got healthy, the season was canceled. It's unfortunate because few players had more to prove in the postseason. But Lapierre is a high-end talent with excellent vision and puck skills, though his QMJHL performance when he was healthy -- or at least moderately healthy -- was not in line with his previously lofty projections.",,"We could have another five-to-ten meetings and not reach consensus as a group on where Chicoutimi Sagueneens centre Hendrix Lapierre belongs on our board. 
We try to approximate the NHL process through most of our work but this is one area where we break from our peers. This lack of consensus would oftentimes end with a player landing a 'DND' tag, short for 'do not draft.' 
That's a bridge too far. We decided it was best to not let perfect be the enemy of good and tried to best account for the give-and-take of Lapierre's game with a spot commensurate with whirlwind of variables that make up his season and long-term potential. 
Why has he proven such a divisive prospect in our ranks? Where to start? 
The former first-overall pick in the OMJHL draft didn't look like a threat for the first-round of the 2020 NHL Draft coming into this season. He looked like a bona fide top-ten pick by the end of the 2019 Hlinka-Gretzky Cup -- it was a performance for the ages. 
""Hendrix Lapierre has been one of Canada's best offensive players from puck drop to the final horn each of their three games thus far in the tournament,"" J.D. Burke remarked, reporting live from Bfeclav at the Hlinka. ""His pucks skills, and the ability to wield them with the same effectiveness at speed as he does at a standstill, make him a dazzling puck-carrier. He's going to do big things next year in the OMJHL if this tournament is any indication."" 
Extremely Ron Howard voice: He did not do big things; it was not an indication of things to come. Lapierre suffered three concussions in the midst of an incredibly trying season with the Sagueneens, and never recaptured that form at any point in the season, finishing with 17 points in 19 games. 
When I broached the tale of two seasons that made up Lapierre's draft-year with an Eastern Conference executive, he offered this. The question for most scouts is which sample they find more indicative of Lapierre's true talent level. One never wants to make long term decisions based on samples of five games, and 19 games, respectively, but that's the score here. 
As our ranking likely makes clear; we find ourselves moved by the 19-game sample. 
There are some stellar tools at Lapierre's disposal. 
Let's start with his playmaking. He's a gifted distributor. integrating head and shoulder fakes as he challenges defenders so that he might move them from passing lanes. With a silky-smooth touch, Lapierre then hits his teammates in stride, whether handling on the backhand, the forehand, using a slip pass or a hook pass -- you name it! The one issue that we often have with Lapierre as a distributor is how unwilling he is to adapt to what's in front of him and take up shooting opportunities or the opportunity to skate the puck further up-ice. 
""Lapierre was insistent on forcing passes that weren't there,""  noted in a September game report. ""His instinct was pass and he fixated on it -- even when defenders moved, making the shot the better option. Many of these passes weren't simply passes that could've gone either way -- they had very little chance of going through with a very obvious shooting attempt."" 
Then there's his handling. It's bordering on elite. Lapierre can effortlessly weave his way through an entire team on a moment's notice, and he did that seemingly once a game during his tear at the Hlinka. 
Our QMJHL scout, , identified the three components of Lapierre's handling that make him so dangerous. 1.         He looks to get inside the triangle of defenders.
2.         Handles the puck near defensive sticks to challenge defenders to reach for it.
3.         Hands move faster than poke-checks attempts. Now. for the components of Lapierre's game that need work. Let's start with his skating. ""His skating is average, with a wide recovery, shortened extensions, and hunching over his centre of gravity,""  noted in a November game report. ""His crossovers. however, give him above-average quickness for the Q, as he's able to find a bit of separation through 
three-to-four crossovers sometimes."" Those mechanics seem to wane in quality as his shifts get longer though, and we're convinced that this might be a conditioning problem on Lapierre's part. Certainly, that tracks with the injuries, and the amount of time in the weight room that he lost as a result. 
He does a good job of covering for some of these shortcomings by playing with a lot of pace, and his rush patterns through the neutral zone create a great deal of space as he carries the puck across the offensive blue line. He's also surprisingly fearless -- almost to a fault, perhaps -- when it comes to attacking the centre of the ice with possession of the puck. 
It's entirely possible that Lapierre could string al I of these qualities together into a cohesive offensive unit over a prolonged period and develop into one of the draft's best playmaking forwards. We'd like to think that our ranking accurately reflects that possibility with the requisite hedging that a player with this track record and this much time spent in the infirmary deserves. ","Lapierre started the year on a strong note with a solid Ivan Hlinka tournament. However, he struggled to produce before a concussion ended his season earlier. He has had concussion issues in the past, which is a red flag for teams. However, when healthy, Lapierre has shown he has the tools to be a potential top-line center.

He's highly skilled and highly intelligent and can play in all situations. His well-rounded game is what scouts fell in love with last year. However, due to a lack of early-season production and health issues, he may not be picked in the first round. His tool kit gives me hope that if healthy, he can turn into a top-two line center.  ","A great skater with good balance on his edges, he accelerates to top speed in just a few strides. While he lacks a true breakaway gear, he accelerates quickly and processes the game fast enough to make up for his lack of elite speed. Skilled with the puck, displays good patience and puck protection skills to help take advantage of his high-end hockey IQ. Needs to gain strength as he isn't always as effective in physical battles against bigger players or when fighting for positioning. One of the better playmakers in his age group, he is very effective in the offensive zone and always seems to be in good position to make a play on the puck. With the help of his excellent vision and quickness, he finds skating lanes very well, generating many controlled zone entries for his team. His quick hands help him deke opponents and create space to make plays offensively. He is creative with the puck and his decision-making is already excellent. He doesn't always put in a consistent effort on the backcheck but plays well positionally in the defensive zone and makes the smart play to get the puck out of the zone as quickly as possible. His vision and high-end speed have always been strengths on the attack, but he also uses them defensively. His biggest assets are his vision, hockey IQ and complete skating abilities and if he commits to working on his defensive game, he can be a great addition to any team."
2020,RW,71,192,34,BUF,25,John-Jason Peterka,"Peterka was a tough player to evaluate this season, as he played very limited minutes on the top team in the DEL. I've seen him at other levels over the years, so I believe in the talent, but the lack of playing time in his draft season makes his projection more uncertain in both directions. I see a great toolkit. I see a player with quick twitch hands and ability to beat pro defenders. He's a strong skater who can make highly skilled plays at a quick pace. He moves the puck well, although Peterka's 60 IQ comes more from how creative he is offensively, as opposed to being a truly great playmaker. He's not that big and I wouldn't call him a great two-way forward, but he does work to win puck battles, and he's not a perimeter forward.","Peterka's one of those players that just screams “complementary third-line forward.” Early on this season, he was one of my favourite prospects in the draft for his ability to play with strength and pace all over the ice. He's a middle-lane driver who shoots a lot and works to get to the front of the net to finish off plays. He's just naturally athletic and it fits well with his up-tempo, north-south game. As the season progressed, though, he never really showed me he had the tools to be more than that. There are times when I want to see him slow down, or he needs to survey the ice and use his teammates better. His play, role and minutes all went cold late in the season. It can look like he's playing on instinct out there. That works for some players. It works for J.J. too but it may limit his upside.

He has the speed, the drive and the strength","Peterka is a fast, skilled winger. While physically well-developed already for his age, he is still quite raw, and some may regard him as a slight “project”. The German winger has the kind of skill-set that makes you think if things go well developmentally he could be a star. He models his game on Patrick Kane, and it is easy to see that in his play. He relishes using his hands and speed to beat defensemen, and when his confidence is up he can make grown men with years of pro experience stand-off him and lose their gap due to the fear of being walked. Peterka is not just a perimeter player though, and likes getting to the danger areas, when he can use his plus shot well to create chances. One thing that marks out his shot versus a lot of players his age is the ability to utilise his wrister effectively while in full stride. His soft hands also mean he can feather some beautiful passes into danger areas, but so far in his career he has seemed better suited to being a “complimentary” player. His consistency needs to improve, but the work ethic is there and he forechecks hard. He misreads plays in the defensive zone at times, which can get him into trouble.","Peterka has a scorer's mentality, with good net drive and excellent sense for how to pop into areas of the ice where it will be easier to score. He has an excellent release and a heavier shot. Peterka's stride is a little heavier, too, though, as he's not exactly a burner. His one-on-one hand skills are average, but I really like his hockey sense, and his scoring ability separates him from others.",,"Everyone was talking about Tim Stutzle after the U20 World Hockey Championships, but what about his German linemate John-Jason Peterka? 
He was the best of the three high-profile Germans on that first-line, a take that is surprisingly controversial, in spite of Peterka leading the group with six points (four goals and two assists). 
Now, if the ranking didn't make as much clear, allow me to state, for posterity, that no one on our staff rates Peterka higher than Stutzle. We just found ourselves a little perplexed by the lack of press for the EHC Munchen product's performance relative to his linemate. 
Well, we took notice. That was the turning of the worm, as the saying goes. It was that moment that really caught our attention; the moment that made clear we needed to do even more homework on this kid. 
He plays the game with such force. Peterka doubtless has the highest motor in this class, and I'm not even sure I'd consider anyone a serious contender. He's hard on every puck. He's an eager, willing combatant in board battles. He's violent, disruptive -- a real pain in the ass. 
""His unrelenting motor is a force multiplier in every zone,"" J .D. Burke remarked in a March game report. ""He'll make second and third efforts where other players generally relent."" 
""Another game where Peterka's motor never waved and his defensive prowess stood out,""  offered in a February report. ""He constantly applied pressure on the puck carrier, deterred shots, and fought for possession. He's so effective supporting plays and reading opportunities to pounce on the backcheck."" 
Of course, will alone isn't going to land anyone an A-grade. Not in our books. There has to be a skill component, too. 
Fret not, because it's something we've noted in Peterka's game. He's an especially threatening player off of the puck. His sense of timing is at such a high level for a player his age. It's one thing to identify passing lanes; it's another to create passing lanes with off the puck movement and deception; it's yet another thing to time one's sprints to these spaces perfectly to become an option for the puck-carrier. It's just one of the many ways that Peterka consistently supports the puck, a theme that carries through all three zones of the ice. He's constantly involved in the play. He's rarely if ever stationary, constantly scanning the ice when the puck isn't on his stick, flaring wide and blending interior movements, adjusting pace, etc. It's really advanced stuff. 
Things get a lot more rudimentary once the puck is on Peterka's stick. It's not that he doesn't have puck skiIIs - - he absolutely does. It's that his inability to change speeds and the infrequency with which he handles the puck within the defensive triangle makes him vulnerable in open ice scenarios. 
Here is how  described Peterka's shortcomings as a distributor of the puck. 
""Peterka doesn't look before passing. He frequently relies on a look-off without looking first, missing a chance to set-up a scoring chance. He often fails to spot the trailer; he drops head on the backhand. That said, he is a technically skilled passer on the backhand and forehand. "" 
Now about that tempo; the one tempo at which Peterka plays. He's a powerful skater, one with a mostly refined mechanical base. His knee-bend is great, allowing him to get low and generate a tonne of power on his full extensions. Furthermore, Peterka maintains a relatively rigid torso, allowing for the retention of momentum. 
The only real quibbles we have with Peterka's skating is that he collapses just a bit hard at the hips, making him a little bit top-heavy and vulnerable to physical contact as a result. He also has a tendency to wave his arms like a Whacky Inflatable Tube Arm Man, and it'd be nice if he could bring them in a bit. 
Peterka does a good job of weaponizing his advanced skating in open space, too. He avails himself of a wide variety of rush patterns, integrates the dotted line, and has the ability to maintain stride through passes, pass receipts, etc. He also handles outside-in, where others go inside-out. 
There is just so much to like about this player's game, even if some of the technical aspects are a little unrefined. The skill level is there for Peterka to develop into a reliable, two-way forward capable of playing in a team's top-nine and in both phases of special teams. ",,"While he isn't the most skilled player on the ice, Peterka is a hard worker and utilizes his solid skating to help his team transition the puck effectively with speed. His skating is smooth, and his strides are effective at getting him to where he wants to go. The combination of straight-line speed and crisp edgework allows him to dip and twist his way through opponents and get to center ice in an incredibly deceptive manner. Through his skating and solid senses, he can get to the right areas on the ice while finding skating lanes and weaving in and out of traffic to pick his spots. He is a good passer but doesn't excel as the primary playmaker. He is a lethal triggerman, able to shoot the puck from a variety of positions and changing the angle with puck work. As a pure goal scorer, he scores in a variety of ways and whether it's a one-time blast or a greasy goal in front of the net, he does an excellent job of finding the dangerous areas of the ice. His strong lower body and legs support him in battles for the puck and he is hard to knock off the puck. Tenacious in board battles, often comes out as the winner in those battles for the puck. He needs to work on his defensive game as he sometimes gets lost but he has an active stick and a hunger for the puck."
2020,LW,72,170,17,CHI,26,Lukas Reichel,"Reichel had an impressive season playing versus men and getting regular minutes in the DEL for a good club in Eisbaren Berlin. I always saw some skill and speed in his game, but this season I saw a high level of creativity with the puck, making difficult plays through defenders and to his teammates. He has the skill and the pace to score in the NHL. I wouldn't call him the true playmaker you want running a power play, but he sees the ice well and gets a high IQ grade due to how well he creates in small areas. The last time he recorded a penalty was two seasons ago in junior club play, but I don't think he's soft. I've seen him be hard on his puck pursuits, drive the net frequently and win battles versus bigger players. But it would be fair to say he's not a very physical or edgy player.","Early on this season, I was more impressed in my first DEL viewings of countryman J.J. Peterka than I was of Reichel. But as the year progressed, Reichel just continued to progress while Peterka's game plateaued. Peterka plays a heavier, more net-driven game (more on him later), while Reichel has a finesse and touch to his game that makes him more dangerous both off the rush and from the offensive zone in. The more I watched him, the more I appreciated the way his heads-up style allows him to impact the game as both a scoring threat and a creator for his linemates. There's a comfort level about his game that I admire. He doesn't rush plays under pressure. To have that assertiveness on the ice against professionals this early in his career is impressive. Add in standout skating (especially through his crossovers), a May birthday and room to add some muscle and there are a lot of reasons to believe he will continue to progress.","Reichel's game is constructed around his hockey IQ. Yes, the young German has great vision and impressive passing ability, but the foundations for where he wins on ice have been built due to what is between his ears. It is rare for an 18 year old to be capable of playing such a mistake free game, especially in a pro league, and especially when they go into every physical battle at a disadvantage. He patrols lanes well, has an active stick, and is more than capable of slotting in for his center in the defensive zone if they are caught up ice. Offensively he is a pass first player who skates very well, having both good speed and impressive agility. However, this year he has shown he can be a goalscorer when given the opportunity and a good play-making center. Despite being physically underdeveloped, Reichel thrives in the tough areas of ice. ","Reichel is another player with projections and opinions all over the map, but generally, there are a lot of positives in his game. The first: He has great hands and creativity. In averaging 0.57 points per game, only Marcel Goc, Marco Sturm and Tim Stutzle had better numbers in their U18 seasons in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga. Reichel creates space and can extend plays. He needs to get a lot stronger, but even though he can be outmuscled, he doesn't shy away from puck battles. He makes really smart reads with the puck on his stick and processes the game quickly. The hands, passing and offensive sense all put him in position to have success at the next level.",,"Everything about Eisbaren Berlin winger Lukas Reichel's statistical profile screams first-round upside. 
Playing in a men's league as a first-time draft-eligible skater? Check. 
Producing in a men's league as a first-time draft-eligible skater? Reichel finished the year with 24 points in 42 DEL games, and did so producing more offence at 5-on-5 on a per hour basis than Tim Stutzle and John-Jason Peterka. 
Showing up on the international stage? Reichel finished with as many points as Stutzle at the U20 World Hockey Championship. 
Hell, even some of the underlying data that I've seen on the team side shows Reichel as a 
shot-quality driving forward with a solid two-way profile. 
Everything on paper suggests that Reichel is firmly a first-round prospect. If only we'd seen any of it manifest with any level of consistency on his game tape or our in-person viewings. 
For posterity's sake, our Dir. of European Scouting, Christoffer Hedlund, has a bit more time for Reichel's game than the rest of the group. Even so, that's a relative statement -- it's not like Hedlund was pounding the table as we worked our way through our final board. 
There are, of course, some undeniable physical tools at Reichel 's disposal. The best of them all is his skating. Reichel covers a tonne of ground, with sound mechanics, a strong lower-body, and an elevated work rate. 
""Reichel maintains consistent energy through shift,"" our Reichel player report reads. ""He's an unrelenting forechecker and backchecker, never gives up on a play, and wins battles through second-efforts."" 
, our Dir. of North American Scouting, and a notoriously harsh grader, even went so far as to describe Reichel's skating stride as ""gorgeous"" in one of his player reports. 
""Lukas Reichel wields two-step separation gear in open ice and the small-area alike: it's powerful stride with consistent extensions and under-the-torso recovery, consistent knee-over-knee crossover extension with occasional linear crossover use,""  elaborated in a player report. ""He's always in motion in transition; maintains feet through stick handling and pressure; uses changes of pace to lull defenders in false sense of security; stride remains strong late in shifts."" 
It's a really solid foundation for an attacking winger like Reichel. The amenities ain't bad either. Reichel is a pretty capable puck-handler -- even at top-speed -- carrying the puck through a defender's triangle, showing a predilection for outside-in maneuvers, and deploying weight shifts to avoid contact. 
It's just that Reichel's rock-solid foundation, complete with all of the amenities, lacks the framework to make a cohesive offensive whole. 
As the shot map, courtesy of our partners at I nStat, makes clear, Reichel has no problem taking the puck to the slot. He's proven relatively productive from those spots too, whether in the DEL or playing in the World Juniors. The question, for us, is whether that is going to continue to be the case for Reichel at the next level. 
Does he have the strength or dexterity to consistently work his way to the middle of the ice against NHL competition? Does he have the off of the puck habits, timing, and spacing necessary to get to those spots in the NHL? 
""Reichel is often stationary and reactionary with the offensive zone established -- this is especially noticeable on the power play,""  remarked in his year-end Reichel player report. ""He's too late to move into pockets of space despite his 
plus-skating. He's rarely ready to shoot in catch-and-release and one-timer options. and he relies on individual rushes to generate dangerous shots."" 
Another matter that works against Reichel in his projection is that he's just not an especially threatening shooter at range -- he's going to need to get to the high-danger portions of the offensive zone to consistently produce at the NHL level. 
""Reichel's shot is average to slightly above-average with power and shot variety,"" one year-end report reads. 
These limitations, of course, aren't out of the ordinary with players in this range. That's garden variety stuff at this point in the draft. It's just that there are enough countervailing points in Reichel's favour that we felt it necessary to spell out our work and make clear our thought process. ",,"Reichel is a pro-ready player and the maturity in his game shows. A very good skater, he is a treat to watch gliding all over the ice with a fast-top speed as well as very solid mobility. Smooth overall skater who relies on his solid skating techniques with very fluid strides. Possesses silk-smooth hands and can handle the puck very nicely, constantly putting the effort in to get to the tough parts of the ice and battle for puck possession. He displays great hockey sense and he always seems to be in the right place, getting to where he needs to be just slightly ahead of the play. He is strong along the boards, often coming out with the puck because of his excellent puck skills and tenacity. He can use his quickness in small spaces to evade opposing players and find open space for himself. He has a good shot, and it is more effective because of the shot locations that he finds. If he isn't getting himself to the front of the net, he is camping out on the backside of the play, waiting for a pass to one-time into the back of the net.  In the defensive zone, he plays a solid positional game and clogs passing lanes, not afraid to get in front of a shot. His excellent board play aids him in puck battles but he needs to try to stay on the inside of the puck in defensive zone board battles. Overall, a smart playmaker with high compete level."
2020,C,70,179,29,VGK,27,Brendan Brisson,"Brisson, the son of NHL agent Pat Brisson, was one of the best players in the USHL and had a great World Jr. A Challenge, tying the tournament record for scoring. Brisson is a very skilled player. He has the slick 1-on-1 skill to beat defenders consistently and make plays in small areas. He's an extremely creative playmaker who can make a lot of plays off the perimeter and make plays with pace. He improvises very well, making high-end plays under pressure. Brisson is a great passer, but also a great goal-scorer, who scored numerous goals off his one-timer. That combination makes him very dangerous on the power play. Brisson has limitations in his size and speed, which is why some scouts still question how his game will translate. He does compete well, attacking the middle third of the ice; and he isn't a perimeter player, although I wouldn't call him very physical.","Consistency is a hard thing to measure but it always comes to mind when I think about Brisson. He's not the kind of player who controls a game with any one skill. He doesn't get hot and produce a five-game stretch where he puts up 15 points and then follows it up by going pointless in his next five games. He's not a volume shooter and thus won't be a volume scorer. But there he was, at the end of his first year in the USHL, second in the league in scoring as arguably the best player on the best team. I suspect his adjustment to the college game may be a little slower than expected given where he's likely to be picked, but he's got a spatial awareness to his game that should help him blossom into a dominant college player in time. He reads and reacts to pressure at one of the highest levels in this draft with the puck on his stick, which helps him navigate in and out of trouble to make the small plays that drive results.",,"It's hard to pinpoint any one element of his game that registers as elite, though his skill is on an upper tier. Hockey sense is solid. Vision is solid. The skating is fine. The son of agent Pat Brisson, Brendan was on the best team in the USHL and finished second in league scoring to teammate Mathieu De St. Phalle with 59 points in 45 games. He still needs to get stronger and a bit more aggressive in the middle of the ice, though.",,"Chicago Steel centre Brendan Brisson got better with every passing viewing this season. 
I left the USHL Fall Classic last September with nothing but skepticism for the son of legendary player agent Pat Brisson's. As we turn the calendar on October for the 2020 Draft, I'm a believer. 
It was his performance at the World Junior A Challenge that really opened our eyes. I was there with Dir. of North American Scouting  for the entire tournament, and we could hardly believe what we were seeing. 
His skating had improved. He was more confident with the puck. He put himself in positions to let his one-timer rip, and there was nothing goalies could do to stop it. His coach was deploying him in high-leverage defensive situations. He was a new player. 
All told, Brisson left the tournament with 12 points in 6 games, good for the tournament lead, tied with Andrei Svechnikov and Nick Schmaltz for the WJAC scoring record. He had four periods to break from the pack, but the USA went cold in the semifinals and that was that. 
That was Brisson's coming out party. Upon returning to the Steel from the WJAC, he went on a tear, scoring six points in his first two games back in a second-half sprint to the finish. 
He's playing four-dimensional chess; the opposition is playing checkers. However one defines hockey sense; Brisson has it in spades. He's the best problem-solving forward in the draft not named Alexis Lafreniere 
The gears are always turning. Brisson skates into pressure to deploy a gravitational pull on the opposition, and has the good sense to either quickly dispatch of the puck to a teammate in space or processes his way through it one defender at a time. It's like watching Terminator's visual machinery break down every obstacle in its path; hostile, friendly, their weaknesses, etc. 
He's constantly moving his feet off of the puck too, playing a game of cat and mouse with opposing defenders, tricking them into vacating dangerous spots in the offensive zone, and stealing the space. It's like that episode of The Simpsons where the carnies trick Homer out of his own house. Then -- whether on the power play or at 5-on-5 -- he'I I receive the pass with the swift, thunderous force of a one-timer that's hard to process even as a spectator. He can get that shot off from any part of the offensive zone, with his body contorted in any position. It's special. To quote , ""he's got a shot that could be the basis for a fruitful NHL career unto itself."" 
Much like Seth Jarvis and Mavrik Bourque; Brisson is a true dual-threat scorer. There's the gravitational pull, the pace with which he plays, the strong off of the puck habits, and an elite shot. 
He's an interesting skater, with more strong habits than bad, but stil I very much so a work in progress. His posture tends to sag from time-to-time, and that limits the amount of explosiveness that he can generate through his stride. His stride is also marked by a wide recovery. He's sometimes vulnerable to a toe-kick on his extension, too. 
Generally, these mechanical issues reveal themselves most prominently late in shifts and games. It's fair to wonder whether conditioning has a part to play in these inefficiencies, but I'm not especially convinced. The simple explanation here is probably the right one -- it's more of a focus issue. 
He seems cognizant of his limitations as a puck-carrier though. Mostly, Brisson puts the puck in one of his linemates hands, and let's them do the legwork. 
One can apply the same principles about Brisson's defending skating to his in-zone defending. He plays with good habits, mostly, but a lack of focus tends to take him out of the picture from time-to-time. He's guilty of focusing a little too much on transitioning to offence and not putting in the work to facilitate that shift safely and effectively. 
These are minor quibbles -- the types of things one can develop. It's a lot more difficult if not outright impossible to teach someone to think the game the way that Brisson does. 
The question our staff often hears in response to this affinity for Brisson's game is: What about his environment? The Chicago Steel scored the most goals in the USHL by a significant margin, and surely that has something to do with Brisson's 24 goals and 35 assists in 45 games. 
Here's the thing: Brisson was second on the team in scoring to Mathieu De St. Phalle, and the two didn't often play on the same line, at least not in our viewings. Mostly, Brisson played with Sean Farrell and Gunnarwolfe Fontaine. And you know what? He was driving that bus most games. 
There aren't many players in this draft that have first-line centre upside in the NHL -- Quinton Byfield, Marco Rossi, Bourque, and Brisson. Whether these players get to that point or not is another matter entirely. 
As the ranking makes clear, Brisson might not have the best odds of getting there, but we rate it as a distinct possibility. That counts for a lot. Even if he's short one spot in the lineup; a second-line centre with power play utility is a hell of a get in the middle of the first-round. ","The son of well-known agent Pat Brisson, Brendan had an excellent first full season in the USHL. Brisson is a two-way forward and an excellent skater. He loves to play the middle of the ice. He boasts excellent vision and can play in all zones. Brisson will need a few years of development, but he looks like middle-six forward at the NHL level.","Brisson's skating is very smooth and fluid in all directions. When his feet are not moving, he can look like he's coasting but he can really turn it on when his feet are moving, and he is strong in transition and is able to maintain control of the puck. The only noticeable issue with his skating is his edge work and there are times where he loses multiple edges and falls to the ice, however his stride is sound and his turn radius is tight. When he has possession of the puck in the offensive zone, he delivers quick passes and has a decent shot and an excellent one timer. He does a good job of finishing chances that others create for him, but sometimes does too little to create chances for his teammates. Brisson is strong forechecker and plays the boards well in all three zones. He hunts the puck well and will get into tie-ups as he looks to regain control of the puck. He won't often go zone-to-zone with the puck, but he is strong at getting the puck into the offensive zone. He hustles back to his own zone to tie up defenders and battles along the boards but will need added strength. He is strong forechecker and hunts the puck well and will get into tie-ups as he looks to regain control of the puck. That said, his effort isn't consistent and too often he looks to his teammates to do the dirty work."
2020,RW,73,194,23,PHI,28,Tyson Foerster,"Foerster had a great season, scoring 36 goals and 80 points in 62 OHL games, generating a lot of shots as a driving force for Barrie even after Ryan Suzuki was traded. Foerster's shot is the first thing scouts bring up. He has an absolute cannon. He can one-time from the circles and beat goalies clean, which is a highly desirable skill. Foerster is also a high-end passer who can find seams consistently, which combined with his shot, makes him very dangerous on the power play. The main issue with Foerster is his skating. His stride is awkward, he hunches over, it breaks down often and prevents him from being dangerous on entries. I debated between a 55 and a 60 for his puck skills. When you watch him in practice it's clear he has tremendous hands, and in games you can see it come out, but he rarely executes, which may be due to a lack of quickness and not a lack of skill. I don't see him as a physical player who will PK in the NHL, but he works on the ice and wins enough engagements.","Foerster was a driver of offence on a team that needed it in Barrie this season and he just kept getting better as the year went along. When it was all said and done, his 80 points ranked fifth among first-year draft eligibles in the OHL. I was particularly impressed by his second half when, after the Colts dealt the bulk of their core, he continued to produce. He was also impressive at the CHL Top Prospects Game, where he made a trio of superb plays off the rush. He's an excellent shooter, particularly in catch-and-release scenarios in motion. After the Colts traded Ryan Suzuki on Jan. 10, Foerster went on a 13-game point streak to close out the season with 33 points in his final 25 games. I worry his skating and pace of play may not be high-end enough to reach his true potential, but if he can make some progress there, he's got the rest.","Like most notable goal-scorers, he's proficient around the net and has no issue finding the right spot to plant himself in front of the crease to put pucks in the net. ","A solid scorer who gets up and down the ice well, Foerster navigates the offensive zone with great awareness and can work himself into good ice to create chances. He led the Barrie Colts in scoring by 33 points and surely would have bolstered a case for himself had there been a U18 World Championship this year. Foerster is a late riser who had a nice performance at the CHL Top Prospects Game. He has a good variety of release points on his shot and can make plays off the pass.",,"He's most comfortable setting up shop at the top of the left face-off circle, taking cross-ice feeds, and one-timing them on net with thunderous force. 
Foerster scored 18 of his 35 goals with the man-advantage, connecting on 25 percent of his shots in that phase of play. That shooting percentage is a bit rich, even in a league where finishing talent can really move the needle but that just means he'll need to shoot even more next year to keep up that pace. It's still very much so a tool that I'd rate as NHL projectable. 
The Colts primarily used Foerster as a centre, and he rewarded their faith with passing numbers commensurate with the OHL's top pivots. The data that  collected from the CHL and the USNTDP in 2019-20 shows Foerster rating in the 96th percentile in expected assists per hour and the 89th percentile in shot assists per hour, both at 5-on-5. lnStat Hockey, meanwhile, has Foerster leading the Colts in passes to the slot, completing 33 such dishes -- that's eight more than the next highest Barrie skater. They also have Foerster completing about 82 percent of his passes total. 
""He sets up his feeds really well, scanning the ice for where his target will be, looking on the pass and threatening to shoot,""  remarked in a March game report. Now for the bad, and if you're a master of working the process of elimination then I congratulate you on correctly assuming it's his skating. 
""Your group thinks Foerster is going to figure out his skating?"" one Western Conference scout asked me. curious about our rating. ""It's not good. I just wonder if he's going to figure it out."" 
Wei I, fair enough. Foerster finished the year with a 4-grade as a skater, and that's just not good enough to make it to the NHL. There are a lot of really enviable tools in Foerster's toolkit; he's got one of the best shots in the draft, can see the ice well, and possesses plus-defensive instincts. 
""Foerster's skating remains a problem,""  remarked in a March game report. ""He doesn't even sniff a separation gear. He has no corrective or recovery ability -- and when he's not playing smart (which happens) he's a negative on the ice. When compounded with a lack of pace. the lack of speed killed him in transition. He was driven wide and forced to dump the puck in with no chance of a retrieval."" 
If Foerster can figure his skating out, play smarter hockey, elevate his work rate, and just work on his consistency -- there's something there. We see him as a winger at the NHL level -- if he gets there -- with top-six upside and first-unit power play utility. It's just going to take a lot of work to get there. ","Foerster has bounced around my late first-round rankings this season and made the cut as a legitimate first-round candidate. Foerster had a steady offensive season and on a rebuilding Barrie Colts squad has taken the reigns offensively speaking. He's a center that is coveted and has decent size and strength. He projects as a middle-six forward, with second-line upside.","An offensively gifted center who is an offensive threat with the puck on his stick. He's an agile skater with good edge work that can rapidly change direction and transition with the play. While he has solid foot speed and good power in his strides, he needs to work on his lower body strength to increase his acceleration though he can create speed through his transitions. Has soft hand with the ability to make nice saucer passes and makes smart decisions when pressured. His shot is a bit underwhelming and could use more power, but he does possess a quick release and a willingness to shoot from anywhere in the offensive zone. He has a knack for finding open areas in the offensive zones and relies on his awareness to fight for space in open areas. He could put more effort into his forecheck and can't always keep up with the physical play as he doesn't seem to initiate contact often enough. Defensively, his game could use work as his occasional lapses in positioning could mean he is better suited as a winger at higher levels.  Sometimes he gets caught with his feet planted in one position. He does have the ability to get open for his defenseman to put a pass back up the ice for an offensive rush. Overall, he seems to communicate well with his teammates, often dictating the play and isn't afraid to get into a puck battle along the boards with his high compete level."
2020,D,74,206,35,LAK,29,Helge Grans,"Grans is an interesting player with a profile that tends to project out well. He's produced well at the junior level, played a lot of SHL games (albeit in limited minutes) and worked his way into a regular role on Malmo's power play. He's been a top player for Sweden's U18 team and often the anchor from the point on the power play. I've seen very good flashes from him over the years, as he can make some very good passes from both ends and has a hard shot from the point. There's a lot of times I'm left wanting more. I've seen a lot of games he makes little happen offensively and his average feet are exposed defensively. I wouldn't call him a top-end puck-mover or defender, but he's got enough tools and track record to make me think he has a fair shot to make it.","Grans' game still needs some refining but there's a lot to like about his raw tools. He's long, he can skate, he can handle the puck well for his size, he can make plays as a passer on outlets or through seams in the offensive zone and there's a confidence to his game that enables him to take risks and execute. It doesn't hurt that he's right-handed or that he dominated a top junior league as a 17-year-old, either. His skating will need to continue to progress as his feet can look heavy. And I would like to see him clean up some of his mistakes with and without the puck (he turns it over a little too much for my liking and can get caught puck-watching defensively). But once he matures and tidies up some of that sloppiness, he's got a chance at serious upside. The combination of skill, production, size, age and handedness is worth betting on but he's going to have to cut out sequences like this (Grans is No. 2 in white, turning the puck over below the goal line):","Grans has a great physical package and is also a righty. That is a combination of attributes that NHL GM's lust after. He skates well, with good power and impressive edge work, and while he is already a big boy he does not look close to being finished filling out. He also possesses nice puck skills, and he uses that ability alongside his skating to regularly skate out of trouble and send play the other way. The Ljungby native has a good, hard wrist-shot that he manages to get space to utilize often, rarely struggling to find a seam to get a shot off. He fits the archetype of a modern-day defenseman, and loves getting involved in the rush. Once on the rush he does not lack creativity, and creates space for team-mates with soft hands and accurate passing.

Already a veteran of half a season worth of SHL games, his passing and vision in the neutral and offensive zone also stands out. In full stride he can feather the puck to rushing team-mates, and also spring forwards into dangerous situations regularly. But it is not just on the rush that his passing ability shines. When set up in the offensive zone Grans can dictate play from the blue-line.

However, he is somewhat of a project. He will certainly be a darn good SHLer at very worst down the line, and very likely a bottom pairing NHLer just due to his tools. But he can make poor decisions with the puck, which leads to questions over his hockey IQ at times. His gap-work can be lacking, which means that he can get walked even with his plus skating ability. Additionally, he has seemingly not quite figured out how to best use his frame yet. Despite his size he is rarely physical right now, and can even appear timid to engage at times. Nevertheless, he could develop into a very good second pairing defenseman with a unique skill set that is the perfect for modern NHL.","Grans has a lot of good tools that teams search for in defensemen, including size and pretty solid passing skills. My biggest concern is his skating. The footwork is fine, but speed is only average, which is concerning in terms of defending a forecheck and retrieving pucks. But when he has the puck, there's not a lot of worry in his game. Grans makes good reads and smart, accurate passes.",,"We've shed a lot of digital ink on players starting the scouting season with a bang. Today, we're going to break from that theme, as Malmo Redhawks defender Helge Grans absolutely does not qualify. 
Let's call a spade a spade -- Grans was awful at the 2019 Hlinka-Gretzky Cup. No two scouts see the same thing on any given play but everyone agrees that this tournament was burn-the-tape bad for the young Swede. 
Everything that could go wrong for Grans did. He played five games in a top-four role for the Swedes and in both phases of special teams. For his trouble? Grans finished with one assist, a minus-three rating, and the opposition out-attempted Sweden 70-48 when he was on the ice. 
If first impressions count for a lot, then it's no surprise that Grans' stock still hasn't recovered in the public sphere. 
Here's what I can tell you about the team side; I've spoken to at least two clubs that rate Grans in the teens. 
It's everything Grans did after that ignominious start to the scouting season that won them over. 
He went back to the) 20 SuperElit and produced at a point per game pace on a middling Redhawks side, good for the second-highest points per game rate on the team. Even though Grans' consistent, productive brand of hockey earned him regular promotions to the SHL; he's still fifth on the Redhawks in scoring and fifth in defensive scoring in the SuperElit, first in points per game. 
That's about the point when Grans' game blossomed - - when he joined the Red hawks' SHL team. It sounds crazy -- we certainly don't agree with this analysis, as a disclaimer -- but there were voices in Sweden comparing Grans' game to that of Rasmus Dahlin. 
Was Grans that good in the SHL? Absolutely not. Was he good enough that he warranted such praise? Also, absolutely not. 
When one evaluates Grans' game on its own terms, though. there's a lot to like. Everything flows from his skating ability. This 6-foot-3 Swede effortlessly covers massive swaths of ice, and what he can't get to with his feet he can more than account for with his seemingly endless reach. 
Our Dir. of European Scouting, Christoffer Hedlund, identified a smoothness to Grans' and effortless four-way mobility as the defining characteristics of his skating. 
This, of course, allows Grans to smoothly cover either blue line. He'll walk the offensive blue line with the puck on his stick with relative ease; and he can mitigate risk while maintaining an aggressive, space consuming posture when defending the defensive blue line. 
In general, Grans is one of the better 1-on-1 defenders in this class. It's simple. He skates well, has a long reach, an active stick, and good habits with his footwork. There isn't much more one would want from a defender in large-ice scenarios. 
Really, he's a fine defender in most scenarios, contrary to popular belief. Grans makes good reads off of the puck -- even if he's liable to get caught puck-watching on the odd occasion --, maintains an appropriate work rate, is becoming increasingly physical, and makes smart decisions with the puck once he's dispossessed the opposition. 
The only real concern that Hedlund identified in his player report, and often in game reports, is a lack of confidence on Grans' part. It's something we've discussed regularly in our meeting. At the expense of sounding like we're describing basically every Aaron Sorkin protagonist; we're just not sure that Grans has any idea how good or how physically gifted he is. 
It's a limiting factor in the offensive zone, too. Grans doesn't stray from the offensive blue line with the puck on his stick, and he doesn't try anything all that creative. There's also just a tendency to hesitate on plays where a surer hand could do some real damage. 
This reminds Hedlund of another prospect that's flourished since their draft-year in New York Rangers 2018 first-round pick Nils Lundkvist. Once Lundkvist became more confident in his abilities, things started to really turn for the better. Hedlund anticipates that Grans could chart a similar course. 
""There is a ton of stuff Grans already does well,"" Hedlund noted. ""I believe that many of his flaws are either stuff he can correct or notably improve upon or stuff that will get better with age and experience."" 
""When I look at him defend, I feel like so many of his problems are tied to his insecurities which then leads to hesitation or poor decisions. If he could find more confidence, I believe that he has the tools to become a good defensive player. With more experience and added strength I think Grans will take major steps in his defensive play. He looks a lot like Nils Lundkvist did in his draft year, and even the year after that -- they had many of the same issues."" 
There are inherent flaws, and then there are developmental flaws. Most of what we see with Grans fall in the latter camp, and those can be corrected. 
That leaves Grans with a good shot of developing into a top-four defenceman who can chip in on the second unit in both phases of special teams. He'll bring a tonne of value in transition, too. ",,"Grans is a defender with an offensive mind and good speed making him a strong puck carrier, using his body well to cover the puck as he transports it zone-to-zone. Despite his frame, he is a mobile defenseman that can move in every direction on the ice. Even if he isn't the fastest skater out there, he has long powerful strides and terrific balance. Defensively, he has an active stick, good gap control and uses his long reach to poke check effectively. In his own zone, he could use his physical skills more in the corners to get a stop in play and interrupt his opponent's attack.  He looks calm with the puck and makes mature, smart plays, though due to his offensive way of playing, he sometimes forgets his defense and gets little bit behind in the neutral zone. Very hard to forecheck due to how confident and smart he is with the puck. He has great passing abilities and makes accurate tape-to-tape passes almost every time. He sees the ice well and seems to find a smart and distinct pass for the teammate that has the best position in most of his plays. On the blue line, he is active and always ready to take a shot. He has a hard shot, though he could use it more. A reliable two-way player that can play in every situation and who makes good decisions on when to keep it simple and when to make a riskier play.

"
2020,D,76,191,32,DET,30,William Wallinder,"Wallinder has intrigued NHL teams because of his significant athletic tools. He's 6-foot-4 and a good skater for his size, and it's possible the skating gets even better given he's one of the younger players in the draft. When you see a guy his size easily closing a gap or rushing a puck up the ice, you can see how it translates to the higher levels. With his reach and feet, he is quite solid defensively and projects to make stops at the higher levels. Wallinder has good flashes with the puck. I've seen him occasionally stretch the ice or make a very creative play from the offensive blue line, which is why I have his IQ at 60, but I did so with hesitancy. I wouldn't call him a natural puck-mover though. I could see him becoming a real player from what I've seen of his best days, but I want to see those best days more consistently.","When you're 6-foot-4 and your four-way mobility is a strength, you've got my attention. Wallinder still has some work to do to round out his game with the puck. He can look off-balance through his shot, which speaks to some technique that needs cleaning up because he's not getting the most out of his big frame. But he can make plays, his head is always up, he's got enviable length and he's only going to get better. The combination of his late July birthday and his exciting combination of skills suggests he's just scratching the surface. There's more work to be done with Wallinder's game than there is with the other top D in this draft, though. He makes a lot of mistakes with the puck and I've seen some boneheaded reads. Whichever team takes him will be trusting their player development program to tap into his obvious upside.","Wallinder is a physical freak. He has a beautiful stride, and is very mobile and agile. The big blue-liner is also a very confident player, who likes to rush the puck up ice, and can dangle when he needs to. His transition play can be a job to behold as he scythes through pressure in the neutral zone. He also has a nice shot, and is good at quarter-backing a power-play once it is set up. However, at 5v5 the creatively he brings in man-up situations is not as noticeable, and at 5v5 he can go completely missing in terms of his offensive game once through the neutral zone, barring a big shot here or there. At times his offensive IQ in EV situations seems to be a question, with poor decision making and not seeing a play developing in front of him.

Defensively Wallinder is very solid, even versus men in the Allsvenskan. He can be physical and deliver big hits, even if he does not look to engage on a regular basis. The big Swede also has an active stick that he uses very well at his own blue-line, and is good at channelling opponents to the areas he wants them to be when he has his gap. He is also, however, prone to inconsistency, and at times gets outsmarted or overwhelmed in all zones playing against men. Some of this may well be due to the fact he is a late-bloomer, who does not have the experience playing at a high level prior to this season many of his peers have, as before this season he had only played two SuperElit games.

Wallinder is a project, who will certainly take time and patience to develop, but it is easy to see him becoming a great middle pairing defenseman with the combo of size, skating and skill.","There's a lot of projecting to do in Wallinder's game, as there's a bit of rawness to him. He has a big frame but needs to tack on some muscle. And while he has some intriguing offensive skills, he needs to finish plays better than he does. I need to see a little more from Wallinder in terms of hockey sense, and he could clean up his skating more to project more favorably. But there's enough to like here on potential alone.",,"If you're reading this draft guide one profile after the other, then think of MODO defender William Wallinder as similar to Joni Jurmo but slightly worse, at least in our estimation. 
If you're not reading this draft guide as we'd intended for it to be read, then step right into my office -- it's time to look at Wallinder brings to the table. 
This kid can really move, and he's a gangly, lanky lad to boot. Wallinder towers over the competition, standing 6-foot-4 and weighing 194 pounds -- there's plenty of room for him to fill out that frame. 
That's a combo that's always going to bring boys to the yard, where boys to the yard, in this instance, are scouts to 6rnsk6Idsvik arena to watch MODO's J20 SuperElit team play hockey. 
Depending on what games they attended, these scouts could leave their viewings thinking that Wallinder is a future top-pairing defenceman at the NHL level or a DND-grade (DND stands for Do Not Draft) prospect to avoid this October. 
That variance shows up well on the EliteProspects 'Draft Center' page, where Wallinder is ranked as high as 18th-overall by one outlet and as low as 57th overall on the low-end of that range. 
The one constant? Through the good and the bad performances alike -- Wallinder always skates well. He skates well enough that Christoffer Hedlund, our Dir. of European Scouting based in Sweden, made him one of the only players with a 7-grade or higher for skating. 
""Wallinder is such an unbelievably smooth skater with a fluid stride,"" Hedlund noted in his 
year-end player report. ""He might be the most technically skilled skater among all defenceman in this draft. Wallinder uses long strides to gather speed but short-quick strides to navigate through traffic. 
""He accelerates very well for a player of Wallinder's size,"" Hedlund continued. ""He'll probably be even faster once he adds more lower-body strength. We haven't seen him at his fastest yet."" 
Now, if only Wallinder skated with a purpose. Another consistent theme through many of our viewings was an effort level that would make Orange Cassidy beet red ... Cassidy. 
""Wallinder doesn't compete much in his own zone, can float around, and often looks totally unengaged,"" Hedlund wrote. ""He lacks that burning competitive fire to beat his opponents, whether it's defending the inside lane near the net-front or battling for a puck along the boards - - you rarely, if ever, get a full effort from Wallinder."" 
The real question is whether one would even notice if Wallinder started applying himself more consistently on a 
shift-to-shift, night-to-night basis, particularly in the defensive zone. 
Wallinder's defensive instincts are, regrettably, every bit as poor as his habits. 
""He plays a horrendous positional game,"" Hedlund wrote in Wallinder's player report. ""He can be all over his own zone, just wandering aimlessly, looking completely los, and not covering anyone in particular. 
""His decision-making in the defensive zone is just so very, very poor. Wal linder often left the slot completely unattended to chase pucks all the way on the other side of the zone. On other occasions, he was guilty as sin of puck-watching."" 
As Hedlund notes in many of his game reports, Wallinder isn't much better through the neutral zone, where his exceptional skating should make him an absolute force. He plays far too accommodating a gap, doesn't mitigate risk with his footwork, spaces himself poorly, and commits far too early. 
It's worth noting that Wallinder improved defensively over the course of the season but not by much. For additional context, MODO's J20 team was a bit of a disaster defensively, and Wallinder didn't look quite as permissive in the Allsvenskan. 
That's about as complimentary or accommodating as it's going to get for Wal linder's play in the defensive third though. Let's take a step back into the pros column, though, because Wallinder has shown some capability playing in the offensive zone. He's an alright finisher from the point, leaning more on his wrist shot than his slap shot, and showing some capability with the one-timer. 
'There's good accuracy on Wallinder's wrist shot, along with decent power. but it's far from a laser,"" Hedlund wrote. ""Taking a I ittle time off of the release would help him a bit here, both to get those point shots through traffic and to take away time from the goa I tender."" 
Where Wallinder is most productive, though, is on the rush. He's a great puck-carrier, eager to leader his team up the ice, and with a great deal of initiative in creative offensive chances. Barring that, Wallinder is all too happy to join the 
second-wave as a trailer. 
The consistency of his passes leave a lot to be desired, but there's no denying the way that he sees the ice. Wallinder has strong offensive instincts, of this much there is no doubt. 
Ultimately, though, we see the most likely career outcome for Wallinder as a No. 4 or 5 defenceman with puck-moving upside primarily, and offensive value secondarily. The lack of a finishing component really hurts his proJection here, as does his unspectacular in-zone offensive contributions. ",,"Wallinder is a player with large frame, but despite that, he shows good footwork and good agility as he can move smoothly in every direction. His first steps are not the best, but he has decent acceleration and good top speed, though he could improve these qualities, especially his first steps. He skates smooth when he turns both with and without puck.  He can play a two-way game and plays in all situations. While he doesn't take any risks in his own zone, he always stands up against an opponent when he feels safe to do so. He seems to have good work ethic and works hard along the boards and is very effective with the poke checks because of his long reach. He could use his strength better when he battles along the boards. He shows that he has good vision and can read the play. He can also be a puck-moving defenseman, but he has some problems with puck control when he reaches his top speed and therefore loses the puck from time to time. His passing is not very creative; he likes to keep it simple and with that comes safe passes with good accuracy. When he is calm, he makes good decisions but when he is under pressure, he can tend to make bad passes that cause turnovers. Offensively, he has a hard shot and uses it in the right moments. He plays a confident offensive game. Overall, a non-flashy defenseman who can do the job without taking any risks."
2020,C,71,176,37,MIN,31,Marat Khusnutdinov,"Khusnutdinov has been a leader for Russia's 2002 age group for years and was very impressive with his junior club this season, which was the best in MHL. He has high-end skill components to his game. He's able to make highly creative plays with the puck, improvise in tough situations and be very coordinated in small spaces. He sees the ice very well and can make tough dishes to teammates. He's a great skater too, using his speed to beat defenders wide and making hard plays to the net. He competes hard, frequently getting to the tough areas in the offensive zone and killing penalties well. Khusnutdinov isn't special at any one thing and he's undersized, but it's the combination of his skill, speed and very high compete level that equals a projected NHL player.","On a loaded team that didn't play him on the top line or power play unit for much of the season, Khusnutdinov put together an impressive rookie season in the MHL – and did it while spending the entire year as a 17-year-old. Khusnutdinov makes plays all over the ice, he's a responsible three-zone player, he doesn't shy away from playing to the interior, he's got enough skill to make plays from the exterior and he tracks the play exceptionally well. That last tool helps him intercept pucks or find space in the offensive zone. He's a long-term project but I see a player who continues to maximize his skill set and makes the most out of his career.","When you look at Khusnutdinov, you quickly look at his height. He is on the smaller end of the stick. In general, when you look at a player who is 5'9, you quickly expect that finesse and speed is their game. But, Khusnutdinov offers more than that. His defensive ability is quite strong and he is aggressive. There are plenty of instances where the young Russian prospect will be physical along the boards at both ends. In the defensive zone, he does not like giving his opposition room to breathe. While he might not always be following his opponent like a hawk, he will often look to decipher where his opponent is going with the puck and block that lane. Yet, when he wants to play body-to-body, his gap control is quite sound and he is not timid about bulldozing you down at the boards. There are times where Khusnutdinov will be very aggressive in front of his own net. Often times, you would expect a heavier defenseman to play that role, but Khusnutdinov proves that size does not matter. He is aware that his attacker is looking to block his goaltender's sight-lines and hope to deflect the puck in the back of the net. So, he goes to work. The biggest challenge for Khusnutdinov is going to be addressing his stride and crossovers. While he is a dominant at both ends and an outstanding play-maker, his skating is the one area that needs more development.","Khusnutdinov is not a big guy, but apparently no one told him that. He's an aggressive player with an unrelenting motor and a lack of shyness when it comes to the physical game or the hard areas of the ice. He can play with speed, too. Khusnutdinov captained Russia to a Hlinka Gretzky Cup title and was a key player for the team that won the World Junior A Challenge.",,"The cult hero of this year's draft? Why, that would be none other than SKA centre Marat Khusnutdinov, a two-way centre who just kept picking up steam among Real Prospect Heads'"" as the season dragged on. 
Now, this isn't Revenge of the Sith, and I'm not saying that El iteProspects has become the very thing we swore to destroy (200 hockey men) but we're straying a bit from the collective wisdom of draft twitter on this one. 
We like Khusnutdinov. When  and J .D. Burke went to Dawson Creek for the World Junior A Challenge, they left feeling pretty damn good about the gritty pivot's game. It's just that we just like Khusnutdinov a little bit less than some of our peers. 
As strong a performance as Khunutdinov put in that tournament, though, his offensive limitations were abundantly clear -- the same was true of his performance at the Hlinka-Gretzky Cup in August, too. 
That's what makes it so hard for us to countenance a first-round grade or even a higher grade in the second-round for Khusnutdinov -- a lack of offensive upside. 
""Khusnutdinov doesn't have any deceptive or manipulative abilities in the offensive zone,""  noted in his year-end player report. ""He barely creates for his teammates or even himself off of the cycle or in the moments that fol low an entry."" 
""Khusnutdinov doesn't bring much offence,""  noted in a February game report. ""Sure he plays with pace, but what about his shot, off-puck instincts, playmaking, and creativity? He's a simple player, with his offensive decisions using falling into three categories: skate into the corner, quickly, drive the net from an outside burst or speed, or back off the defence and pass in the space behind him. There's not much more there."" 
Another limiting factor is that Khusnutdinov just isn't much of a finisher, whether we're talking about short, intermediate, or long ranges. He's got clunky shot mechanics, takes low percentage, drive-killing shots, and doesn't place them especially well. 
You'd think someone with these limitations would be a bit more modest with their shot placement, but Marat has never seen a top-corner he didn't want to attempt to pick. 
One area where Khusnutdinov has shown a great deal of proficiency is in carrying the puck into the offensive zone. He's a willing east-west attacker once he's gained the blue line, and someone who integrates dotted-line usage and a diversity of rush patterns to create space for himself on the rush. 
He plays with so much pace too, and not just relative to the MHL but in the context of first-time draft-eligible skaters period. It's almost problematic for Khusnutdinov at the MHL level, where his teammates are often a far ways away from levelling with him -- this was especially true when he teamed up with Alexander Gordin who is a soft 4-grade skater. 
Whether Khusnutdinov has the hands to transport the puck through the centre lane of the ice himself or not -- he's consistently shown a great deal of bravery thrusting himself into the most hotly contested parts of the offensive zone. 
It's the way Khusnutdinov plays the defensive side of the game that is going to take him places -- that's his bread and butter. 
He plays the full 200-feet of the ice, with one of the best motors in this class. He'll relentlessly backcheck as play transitions towards the defensive zone, and his ability to track developing plays while he's skating at full speed really impressed us over the course of the year. 
""Khusnutdinov plays with a high-motor and constantly pressures the opposition,""  wrote. ""He stays above the puck, angles forwards to the boards on backchecks, shoulder checks in-zone to locate off of the puck threats, and intercepts passes regularly. He'll contribute low in the defensive zone, and he always jumps on pucks as they spring loose with reckless abandon."" 
Now, it wouldn't be fair to Khusnutdinov if I didn't add that we've received some pushback from scouts on the team side about his upside and offensive potential. Our position on Khusnutdinov's offensive skill set is hardly the ubiquitous one. 
We're nonetheless confident in our evaluation, with countless live viewings and film sessions to inform our position.It's not like Khusnutdinov lit the MHL on fire, and he played on by far its best, most productive team. 
With his limitations as a distributor and a skater, it's hard to imagine a scenario where Khusnutdinov can hold down a 
third-line centre's role at the NHL level. If he's playing centre, it will probably be on a fourth-line and on the penalty kil I. 
The more likely outcome for Khusnutdinov, in our estimation, is that of a detailed, two-way winger that can generate a decent amount of secondary offence on the rush and the counterattack. ",,"Khusnutdinov is a smaller player that possesses a lot of skill and brings speed as well as offensive awareness into the game. Very quick on his feet, he uses quick steps to accelerate in a hurry. Very mobile on his skates, he is hard to catch. He's smooth with his handling of the puck and he can rotate his body to generate speed out of corners due to a compact stance. He likes to play an active game and has an impact in most of his shifts as he wants the puck and loves to create offensive scoring chances. His quickness in the delivery of his shot is troubling for goalies to handle and even though power will come with the added strength, the release and deceptive factors to his game make him a multidimensional threat. Possesses very quick and smooth hands, can move the puck quickly and plays nice drop passes using his vision. Smart playmaker that prefers to set up plays than executing. Soft puck skills make it easy for him to move the puck with accuracy. Strong face off skills, wins key face offs at both ends of the ice. Plays a two-way game and is very aware of his defensive tasks, able to understand game situations in his own zone and is good in using an active stick to interrupt passes. Overall, he plays a very well-rounded game and should be able to blend his offensive flair with his strong 200-foot game to make an impact at the next level."
2020,C,69,175,38,SJS,32,Thomas Bordeleau,"Bordeleau was the top scorer on the NTDP this past season, a consistent driver for that team offensively. Bordeleau is a high-end playmaker and the puck ran through him on the NTDP power play. He has the patience to let plays develop and find teammates through seams. He also has a very good shot, showing a hard wrist shot that can beat goalies from a distance if the passing lanes are covered. Bordeleau has a high skill level and controls pucks very well, although I'd like to see him attack defensemen more with his skill. On the draw he shows the unique ability to turn his hands over and make both sides of the ice his strong side, which makes him a top option to take faceoffs. He isn't ambidextrous, but it's a unique skill regardless. He isn't that big or that fast, but he shows good small area quickness and edge work. Off the puck he's fine, but winning puck battles or killing penalties are not why you are drafting him.","The most consistent offensive threat in his NTDP age group, Bordeleau is an imaginative creator who has learned to pick apart teams in the offensive zone with his blend of puck skill, cross-ice vision and ingenuity. I wouldn't say he's particularly dynamic as a scoring threat (his shot is accurate but I wouldn't label it as powerful) but he's a threat to make something out of nothing with the puck on his stick, he's capable of beating goalies 1-on-1 with his hands and he's deceptively strong on the puck for his size. I suspect it's going to take him a couple of years at the University of Michigan before he really hits his stride and adds the strength he needs to take his game (and his speed) to the next level. He's got first-round talent, though.","Thomas Bordeleau is a reliable playmaking asset in the offensive zone. In addition, Bordeleau's passing is on point when in the offensive zone. From a shooting perspective, Bordeleau has thrived from the left side, which makes a lot of sense given that he is left-handed. Bordeleau is not the fastest skater on the ice, but his crossovers help spark his acceleration. Since speed can be an issue for Bordeleau, his ability to complete a forecheck can be a challenge. One of the other issues that needs to be ironed out is Bordeleau's puck possession. The defensive zone is an area that needs some improvement as well. But, this can also be attributed to his speed and mobility. He's proven to be rather effective in the offensive zone with great playmaking attributes. So, I would not let speed deter you from taking him in the draft. There are other appealing tools in the tool kit and speed will come.","Skill and creativity first come to mind when thinking of Bordeleau's game. He led the U.S. National Team Development Program in scoring this season, showing off quick hands and deft playmaking ability. Bordeleau -- who could be a third-generation NHLer, joining dad Sebastien and grandfather Paulin -- is a good skater who can make plays off the rush or with sustained pressure in the offensive zone. His size is a factor, but he has some serious ability to escape opponent pressure.",,"We're really breaking from the pack with our next ranked prospect, United States National Team Development Program U18 centre Thomas Bordeleau. 
The consolidated rankings on the EliteProspects 'Draft Center' page don't even place Bordeleau in the first-round based on the average of the public outlets that pour into it. Here we are, comfortable with him at No. 23. 
It's simple, really. Our American scout has been in Bordeleau's corner all year. 
He's not the only one. 
It was clear from the USHL Fall Classic Just how much the coaching staff trusted the sturdy, short pivot, committed to the University of Michigan for the 2020-21 season ... assuming there is one. 
USNTDP head coach Seth Appert had Bordeleau taking just about every defensive zone faceoff, playing against the opposition's best lines, and leading the first unit penalty kill. It was the start of a trend that saw Bordeleau finish second in defensive zone faceoffs on the program, only one behind the leader Chase Yoder. 
It's one thing to endure tough deployments; it's another entirely to thrive in them. Bordeleau finds himself comfortably in the latter camp. The data that lnStat accumulated from the NTDP's season shows Bordeleau winning 55 percent of his challenges, easily the highest rate among the team's forwards. 
Perhaps most impressive of al I is the territorial domination that The Program enjoyed with Bordeleau on the ice. His+ 171 shot attempt differential is 50 attempts clear of the next highest skater on his team; this, in spite of gruelling minutes. 
""Bordeleau is a tenacious defender who manages to force opponents' hands without 
over-pursuing,"" said in a player report from this season. He's also in the top quartile for the three defensive statistics that our Dir. of North American Scouting  tracks during CHL and USNTDP viewings. He's particularly adept at breaking up plays in the defensive zone. 
Granted, it wasn't Bordeleau's quality as a two-way piece that he had to sell us on in our scouting meetings. There was no denying that much. 
The question we had to repeatedly ask was: How much offensive upside does Bordeleau bring to the table? Is it commensurate with a first-round grade? We value upside heavily, and it took a little bit of convincing. 
Ultimately, it meant a lot to us that he remained steadfast in his belief that Bordeleau possessed untapped offensive potential. 
""As his strength improves, Bourdeau could prove to be an NHL-calibre player with a very high ceiling,"" he remarked in a Player Report from earlier this season. 
What do most high-ceiling players share in common? An innate, unteachable quality -- hockey sense. Whatever one's definition of that most nebulous of traits; it's one that Bordeleau brings in spades. 
His anticipation of developing plays is at such a uniquely high level for players in this age group. There are games where it just seems like the puck is following Bordeleau and vice versa. 
The puck is the Ring of Power, and Bordeleau is Sauron -- it wants to get back to its master. 
He's at his absolute best carrying the puck on the perimeter. scanning the defence. waiting for a passing opportunity to open up and striking with extreme precision to a waiting teammate. 
His puck protection habits are so strong for a player his size, and that's something he'll need to take with him to the NCAA level, then, perhaps, the NHL if everything breaks right. 
""While clocking in at just 5-foot-9, Bordeleau uses exceptional speed, and puck protection habits to make an impact in the offensive zone despite his size."" he continued, ""he's incredibly effective around the perimeter, shifting his weight to better protect the puck for larger opponents and creating seams for passes and shots. When Bordeleau does expose the puck, it's to manipulate defenders' gaps and reach, which he then exploits with his powerful and efficient skating stride."" 
When Bordeleau baits a defenceman, it's straight to the centre lane and into the homeplate area that we commonly associate with scoring chances. That helps explain how this pint-sized centre led the NTDP in individual expected goals. according to lnStat, with over 11 such tallies. It's going to be hard for some to square Bordeleau's solid if unspectacular production with a first-round grade. We get it. We'd also ask that one consider the environment in which he played. It wasn't just a down year for the NTDP as the whole: it was a spectacularly poor group at forward, in particular. 
We're not sure that Bordeleau ever had the support necessarily to flourish offensively, and frankly, his point production, however meek at first glance, might actually be to his credit. 
He's smart. He's such a refined two-way player. His puck skills and the habits with which he handles are both at a high level. There's a lot to like. It's why we've rated Thomas Bordeleau higher than most. ",,
2020,D,68,181,54,PHI,33,Emil Andrae,"Andrae was a top defenseman in the Swedish junior circuit and versus his age group. He brings a lot of elements to the table. Offensively he's highly skilled and creative. He has the hands to make crafty 1-on-1 plays off the rush, and at the offensive blue line he shows no hesitancy to walk the line and make skilled plays. He sees the ice very well, finding options through tight seams at a high level. He's not that fast, but he's elusive in tight spaces, allowing him to evade checks. Andrae isn't that big, but he plays hard, closing well on checks and using his body to separate pucks. Not having a great top gear at his size isn't ideal, but his game is well rounded enough that I think he can make it to the NHL even with the size and skating combination.","Andrae has most of the qualities I look for in a draft-eligible defenceman. He's calm under pressure. He can lead a rush in transition. He has the puck handling ability, east-west vision and four-way mobility needed to run a power play. He's strong on his feet, which he leverages effectively along the wall. He's physical when he needs to be without chasing for hits. And he's calculated enough with the puck to recognize when he needs to hang onto it and when he just needs to advance the play. I have been surprised by the caution so many have about him. He's very likely to slip into the second round and I believe that would be a mistake. His size is normally central to concerns some have with projecting him. I don't see it as much of an issue, though. He's very good defensively for his size. Don't mistake his height for his sturdiness.

I asked HV71 head coach Nicklas Rahm for his evaluation of Andrae's game at the SHL level this season. Here's what he said:

“He played his game. His game is a really high-risk game. When he played under-20s, there was a lot of big risk in his game and the reward is always there. And we talked about it when he came up and he adjusted that. He still did his big things out there and the crowd loved him but he took down the risk level and when it wasn't there, he didn't take it. That's what I like most about him. And he could handle the physical game. When he's not ready for a hit, he's on his ass. But if he's ready for a battle, he's pretty strong actually. He's got a low balance. I think he can have a really good year (next) year.”

And here's HV71 general manager Peter Ekelund on Andrae:

“Emil was not nervous at all. He likes to keep the puck and he kept playing the way he played in juniors, even when he came up to the SHL. And even if he made some mistakes, he didn't change his game. He did what he was good at.”","Andrae is able to puck-handle exceptionally well, both at speed and in close quarters. This lends itself well to transitioning the puck up ice, as well as evading pressure and providing efficient outlet passing from his own zone. He is also creative in the offensive zone, especially at the offensive blue-line, where his hands, IQ and calm demeanor means that he creates space exceptionally well, and baits forwards into over-committing to result in odd-men situations when walking in. This becomes a greater threat when his wrist-shot is factored in, as once a man has over-committed Andrae is capable of driving to the high-slot and getting a dangerous wrister off to create havoc near the crease. He has a good defensive IQ as well, and even though he is by no means “big”, he is broad and strong for his size, and has no issue being physical. At times he even engages in contact when he has the puck in the offensive zone. It is rare to see a defenseman “Forsberg” an opponent… but Andrae did just that on multiple occasions this year.

Apart from size, the only real issue is that his skating is pretty mediocre, and while very agile he has a slightly clunky stride, and as a result does not seem to develop the power he might be capable of in a straight line. He projects as a middle pairing defenseman if he can get faster. However, overall he has a very mature game that does not need overly developing from here on out in order to reach the NHL.","With high-end offensive instincts and poise with the puck, Andrae is a defenseman who doesn't meet the prototypical size standards by any means. Because of how well he thinks the game, there's still a good chance he'll be a top-two-round pick, but his skating might hold him back. His edgework is OK, but his straight-ahead speed is lacking for a player of his size.",Creative and shifty. Is already well developed physically and enjoys engaging. Might not be the best approach as he moves up though. There's sheltered upside here.,,"Andrae has been compared by some to Erik Bannstrom of Ottawa. And while the comparison makes some sense judging by Andrae's small stature, excellent speed, and offensive ability, Andrae likely has a lower ceiling than Bannstrom. Andrae has struggled to stay in the SWEHL, which isn't too concerning considering his age. However, some scouts wonder if he can transition to the NHL game based upon some defensive issues. His speed helps him get out of trouble currently, and I think he will progress to be a second-pairing blue-liner who can quarterback a power play.","Offensive-minded defender with an entertaining style of play, Andrae has good speed and is very agile but his edge work is even better when transitioning to skating backwards and in making quick cuts to change direction, which helps him avoid hits when carrying the puck. A fantastic skater, Andrae accelerates to top speed in just a few strides and his low skating stance allows him to be very effective carrying the puck through the middle of the ice and avoiding opposing players. He doesn't shy from physical battles or contact along the wall, but his size can hold him back in board battles and struggles to separate his man from the puck in the defensive zone when an opposing team starts cycling the play.  He is very aggressive with the puck on his stick, preferring to skate the puck out of his own end rather than make a long pass. Shows advanced puckhandling abilities from the back end, with the creativity to make one-on-one moves, although he can be selfish with the puck at times and can run into turnover problems when he's off his game. Offensively, he has a very powerful wrist shot that is very accurate, but he is more of a passer. He likes to make risky plays to find goal scoring chances and does hesitate to make a play even when it can cause a turnover. He is a great leader and talks a lot on the ice to guide his teammates in many situations."
2020,C,69,164,59,TML,34,Roni Hirvonen,"Hirvonen has been a successful player at the club and international level. He got regular minutes and power play time in Liiga this past season, and was one of the best players at the U18 level in international play. Hirvonen is a highly skilled playmaker. He's the guy you want with the puck on his stick at the half-wall. He has great patience to wait out lanes and sees the game at a higher level than others. He's undersized at 5-foot-9, but he's competitive – although I wouldn't call him physical. Hirvonen is an elusive skater but scouts' main hesitation is that his skating is not all that exciting for a player of his size. I see flashes of quickness, but at the pro level you could see a lot of attempts at making skilled plays die on his stick because he can't get around defenders.","After dominating the junior level a year ago, Hirvonen was one of the only players in this draft to spend the entire season at the pro level. Though his performance in my viewings throughout the season were mixed, Hirvonen has always dominated against his peers (domestically and internationally) and I saw enough in his play at the Liiga level down the stretch to believe in time there might be second-line upside to his game. Hirvonen's greatest asset has become his ability to find space in the offensive zone to get open. He does an excellent job rotating off defenders to keep his feet moving and slide into dangerous spots. And though I wouldn't say his shot is a major asset or that he has the lower body strength of a player like Simontaival, Hirvonen has the skill to finish off plays around the net when he gets open. And when he's not in a position to score, his skill comes to the forefront as a creator for his linemates. He will need to pick up a step and get a little stronger, but he plays a modern, crafty game.","When you watch Hirvonen without focusing in on him directly it can be easy to come away wondering why some consider him a potential first rounder. He is undersized, and really has no stand-out abilities either physically or technically. However, the young Finn plays the game to a high level primarily because of what he has between his ears.

Hockey sense is the best attribute he possesses, though he is also a very good passer. He skates well enough but not exceptionally, has nice vision, and is very good off the puck at finding lanes and creating space for himself and team-mates. Hirvonen is in the right place, at the right time, all the time. Inside his own blue-line he has a good defensive IQ and stick, and even though immature won't shy away from contesting pucks. The young pivot does not have much flash to his game, but has pretty good hands. He is also great on the draw for his age, and has put up good possession stats this year with 51.2% Corsi.

There are, however, legitimate questions over his offensive upside, and whether his skillset will allow him to be anything more than “just” a decent middle-sixer. It is worth noting though that last year his 1.10 P/GP better than guys like Kasperi Kapanen, Jesperi Kotkaniemi at same age, while playing mainly third line minutes in Liiga. It would not be a major surprise if he found himself as an NHL second liner down the line if he develops well.","Hirvonen spent the entire season in Liiga with Assat, appearing in 52 games and averaging 14:39 per contest. He was given a pretty long leash, which is important for a player who tries to create. His size was an issue at times against the pros, but his hands are especially high-end. He's one of the better puck handlers in this class, but at his size, his skating holds him back a bit. Hirvonen has a choppier, heavier stride. His edges are fine, and he can use his feet to deceive, but he lacks quickness.",,,,"Hirvonen is a smart and talented forward with an impressive acceleration, decent top speed, a smooth stride and slick edges that help him move very fluidly around the ice. His quick feet and great edge work help him gain speed and restart the attack quickly in transitions. He carries the puck up the ice well, but often prefers to open the play in the neutral zone. He has a great quickness, which allows him to be constantly buzzing in the offensive end. He has shifty hands that help him retain possession of the puck through traffic and allows him to deke around defenders on the rush. He is smart and he understands the game at high speed. He constantly tries to get into open space to make himself available for a pass. He has a high offensive awareness and his decision making with the puck is excellent. He's very creative in possession of the puck. He has a high-end vision and he finds partners with accurate passes. He also possesses a slick release, a dangerous wrist shot and a surprisingly powerful one-timer that makes him a dual threat in the offensive zone. He isn't afraid of physical battles and goes to the crease when needed, but he clearly lacks both lower and upper-body strength to be overly effective. He backchecks with intensity and provides support to his defender down low. Although he can be quick to leave his own zone once his team recovers the puck, he stays very involved in his own zone."
2020,D,72,196,72,CGY,35,Jeremie Poirier,"Poirier had a fantastic season offensively, putting up 20 goals and 50 points, and was one of the leaders in the QMJHL in shots on goal. What makes Poirier exciting is his skill. He has extremely quick hands and ability to beat opponents easily with his skill. Poirier is a good skater, too, and plays with pace. He is often flying around the ice, stick handling through checks and is easy to spot when he's on the ice. Poirier has very good vision and can make high-end plays inside the zone and on outlets, but a criticism of him is his risk management. He can hurt himself with turnovers trying to do too much. I try not to ding guys too much for that. He has the puck a lot and if you are a skilled player that's going to happen if you play a lot. But it's something in the back of my mind, especially for a player who was on the ice for a lot of goals against this season. The biggest criticism of him is his defensive play. He has to work on improving his gaps, not getting caught too much trying to make cute plays in his own end and not giving up on plays. He was one of the most divisive prospects this season in discussions among scouts, with some saying he's a certain first-round pick and others saying they wouldn't use a second-round pick on him.","Poirier may be the most dynamic offensive defenceman in the draft. From the offensive zone blue line in, he can create in more ways than Drysdale. He's got a better shot, better one-on-one skill and more strength to his game. But he also takes way more risks to create those chances, his game lacks the same defensive detail, his decision-making is several degrees more suspect and he can fade in and out of games without the puck. And though some of those skills can be learned and taught, many of them can't. That's what separates great D prospects who project reasonably safely to the top of a lineup from boom-or-bust types like Poirier. But he also scored 20 goals as a late-birthday defender, that extra time could help iron out some of the D-zone kinks and I'd rather take risks on talent at the draft than make mistakes by playing it safe. I've also seen him defend really well when he's surrounded by better players, whether that's with Team Canada or at the top prospects game.","Poirier is an outstanding offensive defenseman. The Canadian defensive prospect thrives when he is in possession of the puck. When in transition, he swerves and completes tight turns in the neutral zone to open up space and avoid attackers. While there are times where he seems to put in a ton of work in avoiding attackers just to dump the puck in, those dump-ins help pave the way for the Saint John Sea Dogs to complete a dump and chase. In the clip below, you will see at the 4:45 mark in the third period of play, Poirier lean on his outside edges to shift his stride and avoid his attacker. He also shifts control of the puck to his non-dominant hand to make it more of a challenge for the attacker to strip the puck. The one thing that limits Poirier's ability to go further and complete a controlled zone entry in this sequence is his feet placement. At center ice, he shortens his extension and does not complete a full recovery. When he does not complete a full recovery, his feet are place wide apart and he looses his mobility. If Poirier utilized his crossovers instead at center ice, he could have bolstered his acceleration and avoided a confrontation with the Moncton defenseman. There are also plenty of instances where Poirier will complete a controlled zone entry. I've included an example. In the clip, you will see Poirier receive a pass from Villeneuve and quickly use his hands to escape the Charlottetown Islanders attack. He throws the puck between the legs of his attacker and then pivots when he has two attackers approaching him. Once he completes the pivot, he can alter his direction once more and enter the offensive zone with the puck. In the offensive zone, there is a lot to talk about with Poirier. He can thread the needle through tight gaps and that makes him a valued asset on the power play. Poirier is an effective tape-to-tape passer and delivers quality feeds across the offensive zone. In the clip below, Poirier delivers a crisp pass from beyond the perimeter to the doorstop on the power play. Not only will he complete quality passes, but he does the dirty work to open up lanes when he is working the cycle. Poirier knows how explosive his shot is from the blue line and he will use that to his advantage. He will draw the opposition to him and the opposition will get themselves in gear for a shot block. At the point, Poirier suddenly has room along the blue line. In the clip below, you can check out an example of Poirier completing a fake shot, buying himself some room and then firing a lateral tape-to-tape feed. When you analyze his shot, he has quite the range. He can score from up close in the slot, in the corner, high slot/edge of the perimeter and from the point. But, Poirier is not your average offensive defenseman. If he has open lanes and room to breathe, he will exploit it. In the clip below, Poirier collects a drop pass from fellow 2020 NHL Draft eligible prospect Brady Burns. He then works the boards and pivots at the faceoff hashmarks. With the coast clear to the net, he drives to the net and goes five hole. While Poirier's offensive and transition game are quite sound, his defensive play is slowing him down. Earlier on in the season, I had projected Poirier as a top 25 prospect, but over the course of the season his defensive struggles were more pronounced. There are many elements in play here. Some of Poirier's defensive struggles can be attributed to poor decision making. For instance, there are rushes that he drops back for, but skates forward instead of backwards. Poirier is a solid backwards skater, but for whatever reason on an offensive rush, he tends to second guess himself. When his attackers are on the move and do not have 100% control of the puck, he needs to rely on his backwards skating. If he does not, he looses sight of both lanes. In the clip below, you will see an example of Poirier skating forwards against the rush and is unable to see the right lane. Since he can not see the right lane, he leaves an attacker open and ready for a pass. Poor defensive decision making is a trend with Poirier. But, one note that NHL teams should make is that deploying Poirier alongside a puck moving defenseman will not work. Saint John explored having Poirier and Villeneuve together throughout the season and it back-fired. Poirier was forced to drop back as Villeneuve was too far up. Since Poirier struggles in the defensive zone, it was not fair to have him all alone. In the clip below, you can see an example of Poirier having to circumvent a two attacker attack, but he has a hard time defending the puck mover and the forward driving down the opposing lane. Poirier is leaning more towards the puck mover and leaves too big of a gap. When he does this, it opens up a scoring chance for his opposition and the opposition burned him in the below clip. But, it's not just decision making that slows down Poirier's defensive play. His mobility hurts his defensive play as well. Poirier deploys a wider glide in the defensive zone and it hurts his ability to limit lanes and gaps. With his wide glide (feet placed wider then his torso), he is ineffective when an attacker passes by him with the puck. Poirier will more than often look to counteract his mobility issues by waving his stick and attempt a pokecheck, but his pokecheck attempt is an unsuccessful one as he waves the stick and misses the target completely. All-in-all, Poirier can be an effective offensive defenseman as he has showcased that through his QMJHL play, but his defensive zone play needs a jumpstart. Any team who selects Poirier needs to be patient with his defensive game. It can improve with the right defensive-minded coaches. But, it's not just development that will benefit Poirier. Poirier needs to be paired with a strong defensive defenseman, who will be the one to drop back and defend the rush. Poirier will still need to be apart of the defensive attack on those rushes, but the primary responsibility should not lie on his shoulders otherwise he will struggle.","There is little debate that Poirier is among the most skilled defensemen in this draft. His hands, in particular, are elite. But there are questions in terms of how he defends, his effort level and general hockey sense. He can force plays at times and gets himself into trouble a lot. In a shallower blue-line class, I have no problem betting bigger on skill. I think some of the deficiencies can be addressed with maturity and development, but Poirier's skill is unique.","A toolsy defender with above-average skating and elite puck skills. He might be the best stick handler in the class. Transitions extremely well with his feet, but can skate (and pass) himself into trouble at times. Swims around in the high-risk, high-reward waters. Boom, meet bust.",,"I liked Poirier last season, and my appreciation for his game has grown as the year has progressed. Poirier projects as an offensive defenseman, shown in particular by his ability to put up 20 goals from the back-end this season. His defensive game needs some work, and he is likely a few years away. Poirier looks like a second-pairing, offensive-minded blue-liner at the NHL level.","Poirier is an incredibly skilled and talented offensive defenseman, showing the ability to make defenders look foolish and pick apart defenses with his offensive instincts. Strong all over the ice, he possesses elite skating, great vision, quality passing/shots and solid in transition. He always keeps his feet moving and is ready for anything. His speed when backward skating is incredible as he can accelerate at the same rate as if he was skating forwards. He has a great gap control and works well in corners with his strength and active stick, but his positioning in the defensive zone is sometimes a bit off and he could be more physical. One of the best components of his overall game is his vision. He doesn't often make rash decisions with the puck and always seems to find teammates with open ice and delivers quality passes to them. In addition, he seems to find gaps in every zone which leads to quality puck movement. He also consistently finds loose pucks. Offensively, he is deceptive with the puck and flashes creative offensive puck skills and a well-timed and powerful shot from the point. He distributes the puck well with hard passes from the point and he has the smarts to find teammates around the offensive zone. He displays the ability to walk the blue line with his great lateral quickness and edge work. He is the whole package and would slide in well as a top-4 defenseman if he hits his full potential."
2020,D,73,195,25,COL,36,Justin Barron,"Barron is a player who's been hyped for a few years, playing well for Canada and Halifax. He had a tough season with a blood clot keeping him out for a while. He came back in late February, but it was still mostly a lost season with so-so production. On the ice, Barron is a fantastic skater who can lead a rush and close a gap very well, and he projects to be able to handle the NHL speed easily. When he hooks the net and is able to rush with speed, he's very difficult to stop with his size. The question on his game among scouts is whether he has enough skill and offensive IQ to move the puck at the higher levels. I think he does, but I understand the concerns and debated between putting a 55 or 60 on his hockey sense. He may not be a top puck-mover on your blue line, but rather someone who is solid defensively and makes enough plays to take even strength shifts.","It was hard to get a read on Barron this season. He played on a (rare) bad team in Halifax and battled injuries throughout. He has always been a top prospect and has long played with a maturity you don't often see in 16- and 17-year-olds. But he didn't really get the opportunity to progress like much of his peers, his game plateaued when he was in the lineup and I'm just a little hesitant to project him one way or the other these days. I'm just more confident in the players who are ahead of him here. He was excellent a year ago and I wouldn't fault a team for considering him late in the first round or early in the second. There's nothing about his game that will really grab you but he does everything well. I'll be keeping a close eye on him next year. He's a Hockey Canada favourite, so if he gets off to a strong start, he'll probably be on Team Canada for the world juniors.",,"Barron's season was derailed by a blood clot, and after he returned, Halifax was a decimated team, and he struggled to find his game before the season was canceled. On ability alone, Barron has first-round-caliber talent. But in a practical sense, teams are going to need a lot of assurances of his health before pulling the trigger on an early pick. His hockey sense is exceptional, and Barron can get involved at both ends of the ice, although I'd grade his defensive value more favorably than his ability to produce.",,,"If not for a blood clot, Barron might have been higher on this list. However, even when healthy, his point totals are down a bit from what I expected at the beginning of the season. Barron, like Poirier, boasts a strong offensive game. He is an excellent skater and enjoys rushing the puck. He is unlikely to be a top pairing guy but looks like a second-pairing defender at the NHL level.","A smooth puck-moving two-way defenseman, he possesses great speed, agility and puck control that helps him move the puck up the ice with no effort. With pressure on him, he lowers his stance to protect his puck while still gaining tremendous speed, which makes him almost impossible to stop in the neutral zone. He displays an exceptional rush defense, closing the gap quickly and shutting down many rushes with big hits along the boards. He has an incredible gap control and lateral agility to stay with his man and protect the slot. He also uses his frame and long reach to control his opponents and push them on the outside. He positions himself very well in his own end and he cuts passing and shooting lanes effectively. He showcases tremendous strength in board battles, and he loves to finish his checks with power. He has very precise breakout pass, a smooth stride and moves the puck up the ice with ease. He excels at escaping pressure from forecheckers with good fakes and smooth turns, showcasing a good mobility. He rarely pulls any flashy dangles, but he still owns some very solid puck skills. With a powerful slap shot and a precise wrist shot, he can get pucks to the net often. He is not the flashiest defenseman, but if you take a closer look at him, you can see that he always makes the right play. He plays like a with a mix of poise, confidence and great decision making."
2020,D,72,178,39,MIN,37,Ryan O'Rourke,"O'Rourke played a ton of minutes for the Soo, and while his point totals may not jump off the page, he was a driving player for that team and lined up in all situations. O'Rourke is a very smart defenseman. His skill won't jump out to you on the ice, but he makes a lot of smart plays at both ends of the ice and has the occasional high-level offensive flash. He's a very good defender due to his IQ and his physicality. He kills a lot of rushes and projects to play tough defensive minutes as a pro. The main knock on him is just fine mobility. I don't think he's slow, and I have seen above-average flashes of speed from him over the years, but quickness isn't what makes him interesting from an NHL perspective.","This is a ranking I worry about regretting. I agonized over where to rank O'Rourke. He's definitely in the same tier of D prospects as the handful of defenders who rank directly ahead of him here. He's got a real case as a late-first/early second-rounder. The strength of O'Rourke's game is his ability to defend players on the breakout and stretch the ice as a passer. I grew to appreciate the role physicality plays in his game defensively, too. He plays a hard game along the wall and if you can live with some of the penalties that come with it, it makes him an effective man-on-man option who can assert himself over the course of a game. He became a big driver for the Greyhounds defensively.

He's also got some nice deception to his game (look for the shoulder fake below) from the blue line in: I saw him make some great plays off the rush this year, too: My concern with O'Rourke's game, if I had one this season, is that on a team with a trio of other defencemen with some offensive skill, he never managed to make himself the clear-cut go-to guy for offensive zone usage. To be comfortable in taking a player in the first round, I want to see them separate themselves from their teammates. We'll see.",,"If there's a theme among many defensemen in this draft, it's underwhelming offensive upside but strong overall hockey sense. That's especially true for O'Rourke, who plays a mature, poised game and takes care of his own end well. He has the size, physicality and mobility to make things tough for opposing forwards. O'Rourke reads the game well, and that aids him on offense, but I don't think he's going to be major point producer.","Once considered an offensive-minded defender, he was relied on to anchor the defensive responsibilities on the blueline in the Soo this season. His defensive abilities are solid and there should be more offensive to give.",,,"O'Rourke is a missile on the ice and constantly engaged in the play. While his skating is slightly above average and he has a smooth stride, his biggest downfall is his acceleration and foot speed. That said, he can keep up with the play and doesn't get beat to pucks often but when in a foot race with a speedier forward, he relies on cutting into the forwards path, which could lead to interference calls against him. He doesn't shy away from throwing his body around, despite his thin frame. His hockey sense is strong as he seems to know where he has support and when he can take a chance. Whether it's pinching into the zone or stepping up when defending the rush, he understands when to take a risk and when it's unnecessary. When defending in-zone, he does a good job of skating into position and not giving up ground, especially to opposing players in front of his own net. Decent puck skills and vision from the back end, but he prefers to move the puck with crisp passing rather than try to skate it out of his own zone. Offensively, he has a bomb of a shot and not only is it powerful, but he is accurate and understand the closer he is to the net, the more effective his shot will be. He loves jumping into the play and put pucks to the net. He is an all-around combination of size and skill and plays with impressive poise."
2020,RW,69,183,31,SJS,38,Ozzy Weisblatt,"Wiesblatt was a top player for Prince Albert this season following an excellent 16-year-old season where he was a contributor to its WHL title run. Wiesblatt checks a lot of boxes. He's very quick and skilled. He makes skilled plays at full speed and is a handful for defenders to stop when he comes barreling down on the rush. His hands stand out, with extremely quick twitch touches and ability to inside out defenders. He can attack in a direct style, but also has great vision and can pull up to make a tough play. He was on the flank for Prince Albert's power play and looked like a pro in the type of plays he made in that role. He's barely 5-10 so that is the major knock on him, but he is competitive and doesn't mind the physical engagements. He is listed as a winger but can play down the middle.",,,"Wiesblatt has quick hands and can make plays with a good amount of speed. Despite not being a big body, he gets engaged physically and certainly competes at a high level. There aren't a ton of elite traits, but I do think his hand skills are in the upper tier of this draft, and he has some creativity. Wiesblatt has a very wide range of opinions in this draft, but I like what he brings to the table.","The frenetic ball of havoc plays the game like he's just been shot out a cannon. Loves to create chaos on the forecheck and has enough skill to create chances and points from the forced turnovers. You'll love him on your team, or hate playing against him.",,,"Wiesblatt is the definition of a player who is more than the sum of his parts as his physical tools don't immediately jump off the page and while he isn't the fastest skater, he doesn't take any shortcuts. He plays quick with smart and simple puck movement and can carry the puck well into the offensive zone, doing a good job of protecting it in traffic, slowing himself down to let his teammates set up. While he has a pretty good motor, he still lacks that extra gear that will help him find separation. He's not the biggest player but you won't see him lose many battles as he plays with a feistiness and edge that few can match and will make an even bigger impact as he fills out his frame. He has a killer instinct when given space and a good sense where his teammates are even when under pressure. His game is full of stops and starts as opposed to superficial loops and he puts a ton of pressure on the opposition puck carrier. He has excellent hand eye coordination and really excels at both plucking the puck off an opponent's stickhandle and batting passes out of the air. Defensively, he is quick to read the play and react and is active in puck pursuit, angling to gain inside position and using his stick well to limit pass options and strip at pucks. He is a well-rounded player with the puck and has an understated skill level."
2020,D,69,180,68,VGK,39,Lukas Cormier,"Cormier has been a productive minute eater for Charlottetown for the past two seasons. Despite his numbers, including elite shot generation numbers, Cormier isn't a player I would characterize as flashy offensively. He certainly has some offense in him, but his game is more about his feet and brain than skill. He's a very good skater who can transport pucks up the ice. His feet allow him to break up a lot of rushes and cause turnovers up the ice. Cormier makes a lot of creative exits and plays inside the offensive zone due to how well he sees the ice. Even though he's not the biggest defender, in the Q he showed he can play tough minutes and kill penalties. Some scouts question whether he can be that type of player in the NHL at his size.","Cormier was drafted into the QMJHL as a top prospect (fourth overall in 2018), he has played like that top prospect ever since, and yet I'm weirdly confident that he's going to be available well into the second round because he's perceived as small. If he were two inches taller, there's no question he's a first-round pick. Cormier's an excellent handler in transition and across the offensive zone blue line, where he rotates and pivots his way into lanes. He doesn't shy away from playing a physical style, despite being on the smaller side. He was a go-to option for the Islanders as a rookie, which earned him a spot on the QMJHL's all-rookie team. And he followed that up with consistency to his game as a sophomore that many of the other top D in this class lack. He's also a standout defender in his own zone, as well as off the rush and has shown he can drive results on a mediocre team at both ends. After missing six weeks with a lower-body injury that sidelined him from the middle of October until early December, Cormier came back and looked like one of the best defencemen in the QMJHL the rest of the way.",,"Opinions on Cormier are pretty wide-ranging, especially since he dealt with injuries at various points this season. It's hard to pinpoint one specific thing that stands out about his game aside from steadiness and decent offensive skills. There's a lot of ""pretty good"" in how he plays.",,,,"A puck-rushing defenseman who can escape pressure while finding skating lanes on the breakout with his agility and shiftiness. He has a great stride and always keeps his feet moving. His incredible skating abilities create many controlled zone exits and entries using his excellent acceleration, speed and agility to blaze through the neutral zone. He possesses smooth edges, which helps him attain lateral quickness and the agility to walk the blue line offensively. Defensively, he needs to work on his average game and there is room for improvement. With that said, he displays good gap control and backward agility to stay with his man off the rush. He has an active stick and he loves to close the gap with the attacker to knock him off the puck. He loves to restart the attack promptly with quick, accurate feeds and he owns a decent first pass. Although he has the quickness, speed, vision and passing abilities to lead the breakout, he often seems to lack the poised and patience to make the best decision, leading to many rushed plays and bad turnovers. He has a great wrist and slap shot, displaying a quick release and impressive velocity on both. He loves to surprise goalies with quick shots off reception, staying a constant scoring threat even without the puck. He shows tremendous offensive instincts and anticipation as he reads information and finds plays quickly. Overall, he has a good compete level and likes to be involved in the game."
2020,LW,66,182,115,CAR,40,Zion Nybeck,"Nybeck is a divisive player and one I expect many discussions about in the coming years. He's put up huge numbers in the Swedish junior ranks and has a ton of skill. When you watch him with the puck, his ability to dangle clearly stands out. He also has excellent vision and is very dangerous off the perimeter. A lot of NHL scouts see a barely 5-foot-7 forward without great speed and a so-so game off the puck and think his probability of making it is low. I think he's a good skater, but it's clearly more elusiveness than explosiveness in his stride. He's my type of player, so I could see him be a third/fourth-line player for a coach willing to play this style of player in that role, but I get that he won't be for everyone. I do think that he competes well, but it's not his selling point. I respect his track record, especially at the club level over the years, but he's going to be hard-pressed to become a scorer in the league without an extra step.","Yes, that's Nybeck's listed height by NHL Central Scouting, who confirmed that's one of their measurements. And yes, I still have him ranked in my first round. He's that good. Nybeck now owns some of the most impressive age-adjusted numbers of the last decade in SuperElit, Sweden's top junior level. If this were a list ranked for the most fun viewing experiences, he's a top-five player. Though there will be more risk in a Nybeck pick than in many others I have ranked around him, I'd bet on the reward and take my chances. There aren't many players in this draft who could do whatever they wanted in their respective leagues. Lafreniere did in the QMJHL. Carter Savoie did in the AJHL. Veeti Miettinen did in SM-Liiga. But it's a small list. That's the level Nybeck got to in one of the top junior leagues in the world. And he does it without ever really looking small. I've seen him dart past enough good defenders or slide under enough big ones along the wall to believe he'll be able to manage the pro game. Players his size need exceptional puck skills to get by at the next level. He has that. He can spend entire shifts with the puck on his stick. He's always going to be a little limited in the ways he can impact play in his own zone but he's so opportunistic in the other two zones that I'll take my chances. I can't wait to watch him shimmy his way past grown men some more in the SHL next season. Here's one example from this season, slowed down to half speed so that you can see the shimmy at the top of the zone and his near-perfect placement with the shot off the goalie's mask from a brutal angle:","Nybeck plays the game bigger than he is. He has a simply immense work rate and indomitable drive underpinning his game. His fore-checking means that opposition defensemen rarely have time to make clean passes and find lanes. He will go to the danger areas around the net and along the boards and battle with all his might. The Swede has some Danny Briere-like qualities to him in the offensive zone. He is very agile, and has good speed – though he probably could do with getting a bit faster to make the jump to the next level given his size. He has a high hockey IQ that is palpable every time he hits the ice, and he sees gaps in defenses that most players don't. In terms of shot he has a nice release that he gets off quickly. His soft hands also mean that he can make opposition players look silly at times. But he is not just offence only. Nybeck is a very good penalty killer who is also attentive to his own zone at 5v5.","Nybeck is an especially intriguing prospect because of his exceptional skill level, but his size is a drawback. He could definitely stand to be quicker, and if he can strengthen his base some more, it will mitigate those size concerns. Nybeck put up historic numbers at the Swedish U20 level, as no forward 17 or younger has scored as many as Nybeck's 66 points in SuperElit.",,,"Nybeck has played this year in Sweden's junior league and has been an offensive force. Though extremely small and lacking strength, Nybeck plays a lot bigger than he is. He is a terror off the rush and elite skater. He attacks the net relentlessly and isn't afraid to go into hard areas on the ice. Nybeck looks like a second line, secondary scoring option","A small but hard working forward that plays with a lot of buzz and creativity. Good skater with quick first steps and great balance, which helps him keep the puck against bigger and stronger opponents. Low skating stance gives him great power in his strides and good balance, helping him fight through physical contact and use leverage to get to the dangerous areas in the offensive zone. He changes his direction and speed to go through tight defences, though he could use some work in the offensive zone without the puck. Excellent passer in the offensive zone, always seems to know exactly what he wants to do even before he has the puck. Will quickly spot passing lanes to give his teammates scoring chances.  Can also put the puck into the net with his wrist shot, which has a good release and is very accurate; he isn't afraid to shoot from anywhere below the faceoff circles. Smooth hands help him deke past opponents. Good at regular strength but thrives on the powerplay, where he can look very dominant from his position on the blue line. Works hard in his own zone and uses his stick well to cut off angles but can struggle along the boards during physical play due to his smaller stature. He works hard on the backcheck and is willing to support his defenders down low. Gaining strength and filling out his small frame will be a deciding factor in whether he can continue to produce offense at higher levels of competition."
2019,C,70,170,1,NJD,,Jack Hughes,"Jack Hughes is one of the best USA prospects to be a first-year, draft-eligible prospect and could be the first USNTDP player to make the direct jump to the NHL. What makes Hughes a top prospect isn't his skill level, but his pace. He's a unique skater who is so tough when he gets going with speed. Defenses can see it coming, and they still can't stop it. His speed is dangerous but particularly his edge work is special. He spins off pressure so well and can create space for himself like few others with his cutbacks. He's got a high skill level and fantastic vision with the puck, and at a standstill, he can make highly skilled plays. But what makes Hughes stand out from your typical playmaker is how he makes those plays at a million miles an hour. He'll put pucks through legs while skating full speed and hit a target across the ice. He has a small, slight frame, and plays hard, which can lead to him getting knocked around a bit. His compete level is high, though. When he loses a puck, he wants the puck as bad as anyone on the ice, and he attacks the net without fear.  He has the potential to be a star, play-driving, No. 1 center.

USNTDP U18 coach John Wroblewski on Hughes: “The electricity when he hits the ice, it's undeniable. It's controlled chaos. He is top speed, flying around the sheet. Only he and a couple other guys know what's happening.”","If Hughes hadn't solidified his spot as the top prospect in the NHL draft before the under-18 world championships (hint: he had), then his 20 points in seven games, which made him the tournament's all-time leading scorer with 32 and nearly tied Nikita Kucherov's single-tournament record of 21, definitely helped. I was actually disappointed with how Hughes began his draft season. He was dominant but he wasn't unstoppable. By year's end, that had changed and he was the national development program's all-time leading scorer (by 39 points!). Hughes is a brilliant skater who uses sharp edge work and a light stride to pull away from opposing players off the rush or break them down laterally with a quick cut. He can take over a shift with his ability to hang onto the puck and break teams down as a puck handler, or he can break open an otherwise unspectacular shift with a pass that nobody on the ice sees coming. Because of his ability to evade contact and win races, he also doesn't get pushed around, which gives me full confidence that he'll be an All-Star calibre centre at the next level despite lacking strength.",,"As much as Kaapo Kakko narrowed the gap, Hughes finishes as my wire-to-wire No. 1 prospect for the draft class. Hughes has such great burst and an effortless glide in his skating, and he uses his edges deceptively and to create separation. He sees the ice and processes play development at an elite level. He is a shot-pass threat, though he's more likely to choose the pass option, as his shot still needs improvement. Hughes is an expert in making plays in small areas, which is why his size is less of a bother. Although he definitely needs to continue tacking on muscle and weight to his below-average frame, Hughes is unafraid to go to the hard areas of the ice and protects himself well, thanks to his skating and anticipation skills. He takes care of his own end and uses those anticipation skills to cut down passing lanes, but his defensive and takeaway capabilities need improvement, which might come with time and strength.

Perhaps the single biggest reason Hughes is atop my list is that I have yet to watch a game in which he didn't drive play for his line, shift in and shift out, constantly keeping defenders on their heels and making the guys on his line better. He broke the National Team Development Program's career scoring record and averaged more than two points per game this season. Hughes should be an NHL all-star and a play-driving No. 1 center.","When Sportsnet spoke to Jack Hughes in the immediate aftermath of the Draft Lottery, he revealed just how important it was to be the first player to go straight from the USNTDP to the NHL for him. We're mere months away from seeing Hughes do precisely that, likely for the New Jersey Devils who are first on the clock for this year's draft on June 22nd in Vancouver.

While Hughes might not register on the Connor McDavid, Auston Matthews, Jack Eichel Richter Scale, he's not far off. The combination of speed, agility, and creativity present in Hughes' game are among the best I've ever seen at any level. His explosiveness as a puck-carrier is unreal. The question for me isn't how will the undersized Hughes hold up physically, but who's going to be able to catch him with a hit anyway? This player has ‘Star' written all over him.  Based on the admittedly small sample I've tracked of Hughes' games with the NTDP this season, he's entering the offensive zone with control of the puck on about 75 percent of his attempted entries and exiting the defensive zone with full control of the puck at a comparable rate. Opponents are at a complete loss as to how one stops Hughes from transporting the puck from one zone to another. I imagine it's a trend that will continue at the professional level.","The decision to keep Hughes at the top of my board was far more difficult than I anticipated, even a few months ago. The margin is that thin. It's so thin that you won't see me bat an eye if someone tries to present the case for Kaapo Kakko at No. 1 overall.

Here's the thing — even if one believes Kakko is comparable to Hughes or even has a slight edge, the discrepancy in value between a first-line winger and a premier, No. 1 centre in the NHL in value is measured in miles, not inches. The edge goes to Hughes. In the interests of clarity, though, I do believe Hughes has the best long-term projection of any prospect in this year's draft. He's the best skater in the class, and it's not even close; he might be one of the best skaters we've seen in the draft this side of Connor McDavid. Hughes goes from 0-to-60 in a flash and can make plays with the puck at speed that most people can't even fathom with the benefit of a bird's eye view.

It's going to take some time for Hughes to adjust to the NHL game. I'm not sure he's going to step into the NHL as a No. 1 centre, but with careful development, it won't take long to get there. He's the real deal.","Hughes is an elite talent and most likely the best player available in this year's draft. Though small in stature, Hughes uses his elite speed and vision to create space for himself and other teammates. Hughes is more of a play-maker than a goal-scorer. He may not have the same immediate impact as #2 prospect Kaapo Kakko. However, center is, first and foremost, a more coveted position (Kakko is a winger). Second, Hughes may not have the same immediate impact as Kakko does in the NHL, but he projects as having a potential higher ceiling. Hughes projects as a franchise center and is NHL ready. He will likely jump into the NHL right away next season.","An offensive juggernaut, Hughes has an effortless stride, natural skating abilities and elite hockey sense. He's fluid on his skates, reaches an amazing top speed and his edgework is incredible. He's got incredible vision to find space and and maneuver around defenders. He has the ability to turn opponents inside out with his elusive skating and puck control. He can traverse through the neutral zone easily and enter the offensive zone smoothly. He competes hard on every play and will not relent in tough ice as he uses every ounce of strength to battle with or without the puck. His playmaking abilities are exceptional and he's so poised with the puck, he always makes smart decisions. His ultra-smooth hands allow him to make outstanding plays in tight spaces. His hockey senses are off the charts and he always thinks the game quicker than anyone. He has a quick release and a shot that he can blow past goalies as well as good accuracy with his wrister. He orchestrates the power play, where everyone is in search of him. He's able to recover pucks in board battles, but is often outmatched physically which isn't much of a concern as he is absolutely dominant in every other aspect of the game. He's the type of player who keeps fans on the edge of their seats and makes them pay high ticket prices to see him."
2019,RW,74,190,2,NYR,,Kaapo Kakko,"Kakko had a fantastic season in Finland, playing significant minutes in the country's top league and showing flashes of dominance versus men in Liiga and at the World Championships. Kakko has a ton of skill in his game. He's got the high-end hands to make plays through defenders and the cute dangles that will make highlight reels. Kakko can make the real tough passes and makes a lot of great decisions, but his creativity is what impressed me most. He improvises very well, with the high offensive IQ to know how to create offense versus men. Kakko has good size, and he's not afraid to lean on guys. He's not a crash and bang type, but he protects pucks very well, he takes pucks hard to the net and he already showed that he can power his way past pro defensemen as a 17-year-old.  His speed is just average for me. He's not slow, but his skating is not the selling point of his game. Despite average speed, he gets inside to the net so well because of how fearless and strong he is. Kakko could be an impact forward in the NHL, whether at the wing and possibly even at center, and should transition quickly into that role.

TPS manager Antero Niittymaki on Kakko: “His stick handling and overall skill level is one of the best I've ever seen at his age. We put him on the top line early in the year, and even though he was this young, skinny guy, you could see right away he's strong with the puck in the corners. He's really balanced on his skates. It's tough to knock him off the puck. Since the world juniors, he was dominant in regards to (his physical play). He can hang onto the puck as long as he wants. He's NHL ready.”","While Hughes was playing at under-18 worlds, Kakko was playing friendlies and practicing with Finland's national team ahead of the senior world championships after an excellent five-game, four-goal performance in Liiga's playoffs. In the final three of those games that I tracked, he averaged 22:36 time on ice and attempted 17 shots. Kakko is that rare blend of power and creativity. He can use his strong, extended stride to build momentum and drop his shoulder to drive the net but he can also feign the net-drive play only to make a deft pass to a teammate. Kakko is also lethal from the right-wing circle (where TPS used him on the power play) and gets low to leverage his one-timer and extend through pucks, which gives him a different kind of game-breaking talent than Hughes, even when he's not playing well. Both of his final two goals of the playoffs came from that spot.

Here's that one-knee one-timer I was talking about. And here's his standstill shot, which can also beat goalies cleanly, as well as a flash of his stick handling ability (and some impressive footwork) to evade the pressure. Kakko needs to correct the pitch-fork he has developed in his straightaway stride but he has all of the tools needed to be one of hockey's dominant wingers.",,"Your eyes did not deceive you at the World Championship. Kakko already plays at a high level with and against pro-level players. After he recorded the third-best scoring season by a U18 player in Liiga history, it was not a shock that he posted six goals and an assist for gold-medalist Finland. Only Patrik Laine had more points at a World Championship as a U18 player. There's so much to love about Kakko's game. He has a great frame and uses it well, as he's hard to take off the puck and uses that ability to create extra time for himself to find plays. He has the vision to spot those plays and make them quickly, and I think his hand skills have gotten to a fringe elite level. His shot is high-end and heavy; he can beat goalies from distance, but then he also has the skill to make plays in tight at the net front.

Although not Hughes-like in his skating, he is powerful and has enough speed to break away from the opposition. His edgework is strong, and his balance makes him so difficult to play against. He has power, but he does need more explosiveness in his skating. Kakko battles as well as any player, both in puck pursuit and with it on his stick. There's a definite fire in him to compete, and he will be a cornerstone NHL winger.","Only Mikael Granlund and Aleksandr Barkov have produced more offence on per game basis than Kaapo Kakko in the Finnish men's league, Liiga. Kakko is a dynamic player with the puck on his stick, capable of dropping his shoulder and driving to the net or methodically cutting through defenders one move at a time, avoiding contact entirely. It's that creativity that makes Kakko such a unique offensive threat.

The goals-heavy point split and Kakko's skill-set lend themselves to the belief that he's a goal-scorer first and foremost. One of the surprising developments of Kakko's game this season has been his ability to create offence through his linemates. Kakko loves to set up shop below the goal line, and from there he does a fantastic job of warding off defenders and finding teammates for Grade-A scoring chances. In fact, in the sample of players I've tracked, Kakko has among the highest scoring chance assist numbers and is completing 80 percent of his passes — for context, Hughes is completing 85 percent of his. Plays like these have helped form the notion that Kakko could, potentially, be a centre at the NHL level. I'm not sure that I'm quite convinced yet. I'd need to see Kakko perform at a high-level down the middle for an extended sample to believe it. Then again, I'd hate to bet against the guy either. Kakko is the leading point producer in his class by theSEAL (Situational Era Age League) adjusted scoring rating, also developed by Davis on CanucksArmy. He might not possess the ceiling that Hughes does, but I anticipate that Kakko's transition to the NHL will be a smoother one in the short-term.","The list of skaters to produce as much or more than Kaapo Kakko did last season in the Finnish Liiga as a first-time draft-eligible skater is two players long: Mikael Granlund and Aleksander Barkov. Using SEAL adjustments on Kakko's scoring rates him as the most productive player in this year's draft, with 2.05 adjusted points per game. There isn't a better player in this year's class from below the hashmarks than Kakko. I'm not sure that there are going to be many in the NHL either. What Kakko lacks in straight line acceleration and two-step quickness he more than makes up for his with balance and agility on his edges. He's near-impossible to push off of the puck, and that comes in handy when one spends as much time in tight to the opponent's net as Kakko does. He's adaptable with the puck, threading the needle through traffic to feed his teammates Grade-A scoring chances or driving to the net-front himself.

As far as consolation prizes go, one can't hope for much more than Kakko at second overall. He's going to be a capable middle-six winger in the NHL from day one, with the potential to become an elite, play-driving, first line winger in the years that follow. I also suspect that he'll have an easier time transitioning to the NHL than Hughes, at least in the short-term, for whatever that's worth.","Kakko was a revolution this season. He was ranked by many to be a top 10 pick before the beginning of the year, and he had solidified his number 2 ranking by Christmas. Kakko is a powerful goal-scorer. In fact, he broke Florida star Alex Barkov's record for most goals by an under-18 player in Finland's top league. Kakko also tore up the World Championships, scoring another 5 goals against a high level of competition. Kakko is also a relentless forechecker and is almost impossible to knock off the puck. Kakko's only knock at times is his speed, but he makes up for his lack of top speed with elite hockey sense. He projects as a franchise winger. Look for Kakko to be in the NHL as soon as next season and make an immediate impact.","A deceptive presence who's really slippery for a player of his build, Kakko doesn't have any major flaws to his game. His speed is an underrated feature, considering it's his hands and overall goal-scoring abilities that most scouts rave about. A very noticeable player every time he hits the ice, he skates very well and shows flashes of up-tempo speed. His top speed has improved a lot and his mobility is great for guy his size. He does a good job of shifting his body to change attack angles and although he sometimes shows some naive tendencies to overhandle the puck, he has the ability to put an accurate touch on his passes. Displaying spectacular puck skills, he's strong in the corners and has shown that he's a beast physically. His ability to do lots of small things right with the puck is a tremendous asset. He can take hits and keep his balance, which is why he wins a lot of puck battles. He likes to use his size to his advantage and he's tremendous when protecting the puck. He needs to improve his overall consistency to be a difference maker shift to shift and fill out a bit to play a heavier game. Having put in a lot of work in on his game over the past year, he's more than ready to take his game to the next level."
2019,C,76,198,3,CHI,,Kirby Dach,"When you think of what teams are looking for in a No. 1 center, it looks a lot like Dach. He's a right-shot centerman who measures in around 6-foot-4, with a lot of skill and offensive IQ, and plays heavy minutes. He makes high-end plays to his teammates and through defenders with consistency. His vision particularly stands out. He has great patience, finds guys in traffic and makes tough passes when you least expect it. He's a prototypical power play QB and plays a 5-foot-10 skill game in a big man's body. Dach showed that he can play all situations. He's not the most physical big man, but he's reliable defensively and often played more than 20 minutes a night for Saskatoon in tough matchups. At the Hlinka Gretzky Cup, he showed he could be a net-front guy on the power play. Dach has good speed. His feet don't match his skill and his first step could be a bit better, but overall he's the total package and a player who projects to be a front-line center in the NHL. His consistency is the only issue I have. With his toolkit, he should have dominated the WHL, but he only did that in stretches with a midseason lull, though he ended his season strong.

Saskatoon Blades coach Mitch Love on Dach: “He's a student of the game. He's got a very high hockey IQ. His playmaking ability is second to none. There aren't many 6-foot-4, 200 pound, 17-year-old players who can play center the way he can.”","A 6-foot-4 playmaking centre whose stride isn't awkward and heavy? GASP. There are good odds Dach goes higher than his ranking here (as high as the top five) on the basis of those tools — and it would be hard to blame the team that takes him. He's huge, he's strong on the puck, he handles it well in tight (rare for a player his size), he's a better skater than he gets credit and his length makes him a lot to handle when he drives the net (which he needs to do more often) or controls the puck on the cycle. He's also a player coaches lean on defensively because he uses his stick effectively to disrupt plays and win battles. Dach has also begun to play more physically and use his frame more effectively along the wall, which was one of the things I'd have liked to see more of last season. My biggest concern with his game is one of upside. Dach's going to be an NHL centre. A good one. But his growth hasn't been pronounced enough for me to be confident that he has the dynamic ability needed to be a 1C at the next level. It's easy to imagine him as a productive 2C, though, and given all of the other elements he offers, that makes him an extremely valuable prospect nonetheless. The Blades are going to lose standout overagers Dawson Davidson and Max Gerlach next season and the team will be handed over to Dach, so I'm intrigued to see just how dominant he can become in that role.",,"Dach has size, smarts and skill. It's not often that you get a play-driving center at 6-foot-4 who makes the game look as easy as Dach does. Although he lacks explosiveness, he skates smoothly and has a great sense of how to get to where he needs to be efficiently. Size and body positioning are two ways he can mitigate some of the concerns about footwork and lack of separation speed. When he does have the puck, Dach is a shot-pass threat who can score goals in a variety of ways. He's especially successful at driving the net.

While he has that size and solid middle drive, Dach can also pick teams apart from the outside, thanks to high-end vision and elite distribution skills. He has dealt with bouts of inconsistency that caused some concern and a general dip in projections, and he didn't necessarily dominate the WHL on a regular basis. But when he was on, he was unstoppable. It's something to take into account, but I still place a high value on Dach's best being so much better than that of a large swath of the top players in this class.","When Kirby Dach is at his best, he's one of the most offensively gifted players in this class. His vision is elite, and his creativity is right up there, too. Dach has the rare ability to create scoring chances and goals seemingly at will, and good luck to the poor defenceman that tries to stop his 6-foot-4 frame. This poor sap had to find out the hard way that it's a near-impossible task. Power moves like the one posted above increasingly became a facet of Dach's game as the season continued. It's clear that he's beginning to understand the physical advantages available to him, and leveraging those for Grade-A scoring chances. It's added a fastball to Dach's arsenal, whereas he used to only operate with breaking pitches. In layman's, Dach's foremost skill is as a playmaker. This three-zone pass is a perfect example of how well Dach sees the ice, and how that vision allows him to make quick decisions once the puck is on his stick to take advantage of the defence. The downside with Dach is that his production, although good, isn't spectacular, and that's what was required to rank any higher with players like Cozens and Turcotte directly in front of him. Furthermore, it's slightly concerning (sample size limitations here are worth accounting for) that Dach is only completing about two-thirds of his passes based on the sample of games I've tracked — a low number compared to his peers — and his scoring chance assist numbers aren't great either.","Kirby Dach is the prototypical first-line centre that teams dream of landing at the Draft. Well, at least in theory. Dach stands at 6-foot-4, has silky-smooth mitts and can power through defencemen with pace when he's at the top of his game. Over the year, I found that Dach wielded his lengthy-frame to greater effect with each passing game. I'm not ready to label him a power forward — Dach is more of a playmaker — but the capability to bury the shoulder, drive to the net, and find twine with two or three defenders dangling off of him is there. It's interesting to note, though, that in the five-game sample I tracked for Dach that he did a better job of generating scoring chances himself than setting up his teammates. The concerns I have about Dach's game stem mostly from wavering competitiveness on a game-to-game basis, as well as his penchant for absorbing dangerous, massive hits as a result of skating with his head down — seriously, it's a legitimate concern for his long-term durability. I see the potential for Dach to develop into a dynamic No. 1 centre, but in my estimation, he's more likely destined to play as a No. 2 pivot.","Due to his size and ability, Dach is often compared to fellow WHL center Dylan Cozens. However, there are differences in their game. Dach is more of a playmaker than a goal scorer. He uses his frame and high-end puck skills to create scoring opportunities for his teammates. Dach's biggest knock is his game often lacks tenacity and a high level of compete. Dach projects as a high-end #2 center at the NHL level and is likely a year or two away from regular NHL duty.","A tantalizing combination of skill and size, Dach is an offense-first center who is developing his 200-foot game. He may not always look crisp when striding quickly, but he's an absolute wrecking ball and showcases a ton of power in his feet. His stride will need to be refined which will lead to more neutral zone speed. Simply put, he's a highlight reel waiting to happen. He plays with a calm confidence, dictates the pace of play and has the ability to take over a game at any point. Displaying incredible vision and passing ability, he works well in tight around the net with very soft hands. He is sublime in his puck control both in tight and with his hands away from his body. He plays with a very long stick and is a vacuum for any puck within his reach. Once he has possession, he is incredibly difficult to strip of the puck due to his size, reach and impeccable puck control. Defensively, Dach is solid. He uses his lengthy stick very well, but could use his huge frame to separate opponents off the puck more often. Overall, Dach has high-end skill with above average hockey IQ. He needs to compete harder at winning more battles and loose pucks. Although he has shown moderate improvements on the dot, more work on winning faceoffs will be necessary."
2019,D,72.75,195,4,COL,,Bowen Byram,"Byram is my top ranked defenseman in this draft class. He was often asked to play 30 minutes a game for the Giants, showing immense offensive potential, including leading the WHL playoffs in scoring. Byram is a high-end skater with the ability to lead a rush and close gaps. He's got quick-twitch feet and a great first step. He's very active with his skating, as I often see him join rushes and lead ones, and he can activate well off the blueline. He's very skilled. I don't think he's truly tapped into how good offensively he can be despite his great numbers. He's got fantastic puck skills. I've watched him in practice manipulate the puck at an elite level. While he makes plenty of skilled plays, I think his individual creativity has another level than he's shown. I didn't see him consistently make high-end passes through seams at the offensive blueline. He has that in his game, but at times he relies on his skating and shot. He's a very patient and poised player who sees the game develop and has great outlets, which is why I give his IQ a 60 grade. Byram has an accurate shot and scored quite a few difficult goals from a distance this season. Defensively he's solid with good gaps, awareness and compete level, plus some physical edge; but it's how often the team has the puck when he's on the ice that makes him so good.

Vancouver Giants coach Michael Dyck on Byram: “His ability to jump away from checks is elite. He's got a great first four steps. He moves well laterally across the blue line. He can defend speed off the rush. His puck skills are elite. He can move the puck and has a great sense to find the open man and playing fast.”","I've already broken down Byram's game as the best defenceman in the draft and a frontrunner for third overall in considerably more detail here but the short of it is that while there is still work to be done on his defensive play, particularly with his effort and his spacial awareness within defensive zone schemes, Byram is one of the better goal scoring defencemen the NHL draft has seen in recent memory. Furthermore, he is an excellent three-zone passer and a strong skater who can recover from mistakes made pushing the play into the high slot if the puck goes back the other way. And he just keeps getting better, and better and better. The Byram of the last half of the season and into the playoffs was one of the best players in junior hockey.",,"Byram has been a significant riser and is an exceptional talent. There are teams that view Byram as a future No. 1 defenseman. There is no denying that he has some incredible offensive skill, but I would like to see Byram become a bit more consistent as a defender. I think the skating is excellent, and he has a good sense of how to play efficiently in a boatload of minutes. He willed Vancouver to the WHL final this season, and that's going to resonate.

One scout I spoke to expressed concern that the way Byram scored goals -- popping deep into zones and aggressively jumping plays -- won't translate to the NHL. I think elements of it can, but he will have to become a bit more selective. He's the best defenseman in this draft by a fairly large margin, but the highly touted forwards available in this draft offer a bit more long-term value. The threshold of a future No. 1 defenseman is pretty high, and I'm not sure Byram is there yet for me. But he's close and a definite top-10 talent in this class.","The gap in quality between Bowen Byram and the next best defenceman in this class might be more significant than any other two subsequent defencemen in this class. That's equal parts Byram's quality as a defender and the quality of the group that follows him. The shallowness in this year's class is going to contribute in a significant way to Byram going, in all likelihood, with one of the first five picks, where he might be closer to ten in most years. 

All that said, Byram is an excellent offensive defenceman that has all the skills to be a dynamic point producer from the blue line at the NHL level. Every facet of Byram's skating is at a high, high-level; his acceleration, mobility, and top-end speed are all projectable to the NHL. Byram's hockey sense is the binding ingredient that puts it all together into a coherent, delectable package. He sees the ice as well as anyone from the back-end in this year's class. One of the main knocks on Byram is that he can appear to float from time to time and has a tendency to skate himself into trouble. There might be something to that. I've seen instances of both. That said, Bowen has the highest on-ice goals for percentage on the team, is second in points, and is top ten in the WHL in estimated time-on-ice at 5-on-5. If that's what Byram can do without giving a full-effort, imagine what happens when his ice-time drops and Byram doesn't need to conserve energy.","There's only one defenceman in this class that I project as a No. 1 defenceman at the NHL level with any certainty, and that's, Bowen Byram. And I do so with a significant degree of certainty at that.

Byram was a leading member of the Vancouver Giants that pushed the Prince Albert Raiders to overtime in Game 7 for the WHL title. He was a constant on the ice for the Giants, rising to nearly 30 estimated minutes at 5-on-5 per game, and remaining a highly-effective offensive defenceman from puck drop to the final horn, night in and night out. There aren't any glaring holes in Byram's game. He's an excellent skater, with good balance, explosiveness and a high-end top-gear. I've found that Byram's hockey sense is high-end and that he can make the game look effortless to him as a result. I've heard some in the industry express concerns about his ability to defend, but those concerns seem overstated in my estimation. Byram does a good job of holding the blue line, and he uses an active stick to interrupt passing lanes and disrupt oncoming puck-carriers.

Some believe that Byram can step into an NHL lineup as soon as next season. I'm not sure that I'm that bullish on Byram, but he's not far off. One year at the very most.","It is rare that a defenseman scores over 20 goals in any league in this day and age, and yet Byram put up 26 in his draft eligible, one of the highest totals in recent memory. Byram is the only true #1 defenseman prospect in this draft. Byram is an elite skater and has tremendous upside. He also performs in high pressure situations, as shown by his ability to produce in the playoffs and in overtime games. Byram has the ability to drive play, something that is rare amongst defenseman. Byram projects as a true #1, first pairing defenseman at the NHL level.","Showing elite offensive potential, Byram uses his strong skating and offensive instincts to drive the play. A prototypical two-way defenseman, he's able to mobilize his big body on the attack and in his own zone, changing the landscape of the play by accelerating and pushing the game at his pace. A vital catalyst to his team, he anticipates the play extremely well in transition and on offense. At times, he can look disinterested in his defensive responsibilities and his positioning in his own zone can be iffy. This could be due to the fact that he logs so many minutes for Vancouver on the blue line. He does possess all the tools to improve his defensive game. He's excellent on the breakout and is great at creating offense from the back end, which is what every team wants on their top pairing. Perfectly suited for today's possession-based game, he's unflappable under pressure and usually finds ideal passing or skating lanes out of his own end and into the offensive zone. He has a quick shot that is accurate, but still needs to put in work to get more power behind it. Possessing excellent vision, creativity and awareness, he's a highly-precise passer who connects quickly and efficiently with teammates to get pucks out of his own zone. He also has the adept awareness to lead and be deceptive in delivery."
2019,C,71.25,186,5,LAK,,Alex Turcotte,"Turcotte had a tough season, missing time due to injury and contracting mononucleosis late in the season. When healthy, though, he was awesome and a dominant center at the USHL level. He's a well-rounded prospect without any clear weakness in his game and a lot of high-end elements. He's a great skater with a clean stride and can barrel down the wing with speed. Turcotte's speed is good, not overwhelming, but he's got a fantastic first step and a great overall pace to his game. He combines that pace with very good hands and vision, showing how versatile a threat he can be. He can make creative plays off the flank and sees his options well. It's not just his speed and skill that stand out, but his compete level is elite. Turcotte is the kind of forward who can dangle around defensemen, blow by them or drive his way through them. He gets to the net, consistently and without fear. He battles for pucks as hard as anyone and typically wins them, even at 5-foot-11. He's not the biggest center, but that is really the only criticism I can find of his game. Turcotte has been a top prospect for many years and this season he showed exactly why he's been so touted.

USNTDP U18 coach John Wroblewski on Turcotte: “Sandpaper and silk. He's the perfect blend of speed, skill and power. He's kind of a Brad Marchand type who plays center. He's got that 1-on-1 ability, he's got a great shot in tight, unbelievable vision and he plays with an edge. His game is predicated on him driving the puck to the net and putting the opposition on their heels. His bravery combined with his speed makes him the player that he is.”","When Turcotte missed much of the first half of the season due to injury, I expected it would take him some time to adjust and find his game after he returned, especially given the way Hughes and Trevor Zegras were playing down the middle for the program. That wasn't the case … at all. Turcotte was, from the moment he returned to game action, the program's biggest driving force behind Hughes. There were a number of games when Zegras, Cole Caufield, Matthew Boldy or Cam York would grab the attention. There were plenty of them, frankly. But Turcotte was the most consistent of the bunch. He doesn't have the finishing ability of Caufield or the cross-ice playmaking ability of Zegras, but he's a significantly better two-way player than both while remaining an exciting offensive threat as a passer and a shooter. Turcotte is strong on the puck, powerful when he chooses and careful when he needs to be. Add that to the way he fights to win pucks back and keep plays alive and you've got arguably the most complete player in the draft.",,"It has been a winding season for Turcotte, who was on the shelf with a significant injury the first half of the season and had to deal with a bout of mono toward the end, but when he was healthy, he was exceptional. He is a smart, two-way forward with an unrelenting motor and an ability to make plays in the offensive end of the ice. Turcotte is dogged in puck pursuit and remarkably strong, despite being average-sized. He is a fierce competitor but does not step over the line very often. He is not always flashy and doesn't always make the eye-popping play, but he makes the right plays. Turcotte goes hard to the net and into the corners, and he has the touch and plus-level vision to make plays under duress and find better options in tougher situations with the puck on his stick. On top of that, Turcotte has good speed and can make plays in transition. He has deceptive feet, showcasing a good second gear that allows him to beat defenders wide or challenge them inside.

Although his season was abbreviated by injury, some of his rate stats stand out. He appeared in just 16 games against USHL competition but had 34 points, an average of 2.13 points per game -- higher than Hughes. His 1.68 points per game in all competitions for the U18 Team was second only to Hughes, albeit a distant second.","Had Alex Turcotte remained healthy for the entirety of his draft-season, it's entirely possible he'd be a legitimate candidate as a top-five selection across the board. Turcotte produced at over a two points per game pace against USHL competition with the development program this season and almost matched those numbers playing against the NCAA.Only Phil Kessel, Auston Matthews, and Jack Hughes have matched or bettered that pace over a prolonged sample in the USNTDP's history.

Turcotte, committed to the University of Wisconsin for 2019-20, put these numbers up playing mostly on the second line, behind Hughes. As impressive as Turcotte's raw production is, it's even better when contextualized looking at his time-on-ice. When Turcotte was on the ice at 5-on-5, he produced roughly four points per hour — the best rate from any player, in any league, in this class — and his SEAL adjusted scoring rate of 1.76 points per game is second only to Kakko. 

There isn't a catch, either. It's not like Turcotte is giving up a lot defensively. This is a player that's every bit as proficient from his own zone as he is the offensive zone. One scout that I spoke with compared him to Patrice Bergeron, after qualifying that he hates player comparisons. The speed, skill, production — it's all there. Turcotte can be a dynamic, franchise centre at the next level if he stays healthy.","There isn't any one component of USNTDP centre Alex Turcotte's game that isn't high-end or elite — I don't throw the latter of those two words around lightly, either, you'll find. He's a highly competitive, two-way centre with elite vision and playmaking ability; a player that has the potential to develop into a Patrice Bergeron-like player at the NHL level. The only question I have about Turcotte is whether he'll be able to stay healthy enough to put all those tools together and carve out a highly-successful, long-term NHL career. Time has proven that injuries, particularly when a player is this young, are more about luck than anything else, and I'm clearly not deterred as his ranking can attest.

Turcotte has committed to the University of Wisconsin next season, where he'll have every opportunity to play significant minutes, in high-leverage situations, and both phases of special teams. It's the perfect spot for his development. Unfortunately for the Badgers, it's going to be more of a pit stop than anything else. Turcotte's game is mature beyond his years, and he'll be able to transition to the NHL in not much time at all.","Turcotte, overall this season, averaged over 2 points per game. This, in fact, was a higher rate than #1 prospect Jack Hughes. If it wasn't for injury, Turcotte would have set numerous records this season. Turcotte has very few flaws in his game if any. He boasts excellent offensive ability and plays a well rounded game. He hates losing and plays with a tenacious flare and high compete level, a level that is considered one of the highest in the draft overall. Turcotte is likely a year away from NHL duty, but it wouldn't be surprisingly to see him in the NHL late next season. Turcotte projects as a two-way #1 center at the NHL level.","A skilled two-way forward, Turcotte has an amazing top speed that allows him to create many controlled zone entries. He owns great acceleration and agility, which makes him deadly on the breakout and in the neutral zone. Though it looks like he's still getting used to his legs, his skating is effective and powerful allowing him to break through contact and drive to the net or down low. With both great speed and puck protection, he passes defensemen on the outside with ease at high speed. He pushes the pace of play and carries the puck through the neutral zone and into the offensive end at full speed. He's big and lanky with a good amount of power that enables him to be a dominant force with the puck. An exciting player to watch, he boasts nice hands and can beat opponents one-on-one with creative stick work. He has the ability to spread the ice and draw defenders over to him, while then firing cross-ice passes to set up teammates for scoring chances. Not afraid to be a net-front presence, he shows he's willing to do anything to score and win. He has some filthy mitts and he can pull off incredible moves to create space for himself. He's very competitive and he will battle with intensity for every loose puck. He backchecks with intensity and is very involved defensively."
2019,D,75,208,6,DET,,Moritz Seider,"Seider played all season in the top German pro league and was impressive in the World Championships for a U18 player. He looked good for a 17-year-old but never stood out versus men until the end of the season. At the IIHF U20 B pool, though, we saw the best of Seider. He was the best defenseman in the tournament as a double underage player. He's got great athletic tools as a 6-foot-4 defenseman who skates well. He uses his feet to join attacks often and can make plays at speed. Seider's main criticism from scouts is his lack of standout puck skill and that he won't be a true power play guy in the NHL. With that said, he has decent touch and makes plays. He moves the puck well, showing great poise and instincts.  Defensively he's a rock with his wingspan, feet and defensive acumen, and projects as a tough minutes player in the NHL. He is one of the best German prospects in recent memory.","Playing as a 17-year-old for most of the year, Seider was a third-pairing defenceman on the DEL champs, alongside former Stanley Cup champions and a number of players who fashioned out impressive careers in the AHL and NHL. He's one of those players who isn't going to wow you with his offensive upside but has proven he has the skill needed to be more than a tough-minutes option who goes off the glass and out. His size (which still has room to become even stronger, believe it or not) and length define him but he also possesses OK puck handling ability, a wrist shot that has some whip and bend to it (he doesn't use his slapshot all that often but his wrister comes in hard) and rapidly-improving skating to his game too. You can see that skating at play below (you'll notice his legs splay from the knees, creating an awkward extension, but that there's still a lot of power being generated to allow him to pull away). And watch the way he closes out on a loose puck, uses his size to gain body position, powers up the right-wing boards and exits the zone with a cross-ice pass for a primary assist. Or the way he again uses that size along the boards, this time in the offensive zone to protect the puck and send the shot on net for another playoff assist. He's reliable in his own zone, rubs carriers out along the wall and has the skill needed to escape and exit the zone with an outlet pass. Though I wouldn't take him in the first round, I'm not going to be surprised when a team does.",,"One of the most intriguing players in this entire draft, Seider won a championship in Germany's top pro league. And while skating for Germany at the under-20 and World Championship levels, he showcased incredible poise, played big minutes and displayed the size and strength to compete with pros. He's a strong skater for such a big guy and sees the ice particularly well. Seider can make plays at the offensive blue line and does a good job of absorbing and evading pressure in his own zone. He's a right-shot, too, which is becoming a lot harder to find these days. There's some risk because Seider didn't have a ton of reps on special teams and in key situations this season, but he should be able to get those next season. The potential reward is especially high with him.","Much of what I said earlier about Soderstrom applies to Moritz Seider. Seider is a right-shot defenceman who lacks high-end upside but has many projectible traits in the defensive zone that offer him a higher floor than most defencemen in this class. That said, in the interest of fairness, there is some debate over Seider's offensive capabilities — I just remain unconvinced.","There's not a whole lot more one could ask of Moritz Seider than the performance he turned in this season. Seider played top-four minutes for one of the DEL's premier teams, escaped the sample of games that I tracked with a 57 percent share of the on-ice shot attempts and a 63 percent ratio of scoring chance control when he was on the ice. Then Seider went on to play in a big role for Germany in the World Hockey Championships and handled the role exceedingly well, too. Seider's best attribute is his hockey sense. It's high-end. He can anticipate plays, sometimes two steps ahead of his opponents, and he can skate well enough to act on his reads as a disruptive defensive force. I'm not convinced there's a lot of offensive upside in Seider's game, but I like his chances of developing into a modern, top-four defensive defenceman.","Seider is a big German defender that is considered by many to be a project. Seider possesses excellent size and strength and played against men in Germany last season. He also didn't look out of place at the World Championships. Seider has all the tools to be a top-4 two-way defender at the NHL level. However, he will likely need a good amount of development time (3-4 years).","A confident puck-moving defenseman who can play a composed game even in high-pressure situations, he makes smart decisions with the puck and it's a trait that hasn't gone unnoticed. Mobile despite his size, he has a powerful skating stride and good top speed. Can make smart and accurate breakout passes to teammates and rarely makes mistakes when it comes to moving the puck up the ice. Defensively sound and can be relied upon on the penalty kill because of his great gap control. Uses an active stick to break up plays in his own zone. Known for jumping in offensively, he's very mobile and knows an opportunity when he sees one. Knows how to patrol the blueline, he rarely gets caught out of position and looks like he belongs on the ice with his confidence, poise and transition game. He has all the tools, but he needs to work on his transition game in the defensive zone so he doesn't get caught off guard. His physical side of the game is the icing on the cake and he plays an aggressive style of defensive play that teams will covet. Sometimes he tries to use his physicality to make unnecessary hits, which puts him out position, but he will likely learn to pick his spots. Sound defensively and dynamic offensively, he has the tools to be a reliable, minute-munching defenseman."
2019,C,75.25,183,7,BUF,,Dylan Cozens,"Cozens is a very well-rounded prospect. For the past two seasons in the WHL and in international play, he consistently impressed. Cozens measures in at 6-foot-3 and is a very good skater, not just for his size, but overall. That combination alone makes him a handful to deal with when a guy that size comes barreling through the neutral zone. He doesn't just skate fast, he consistently pushes the pace and plays the game hard. Cozens is not going to do a fancy between the legs kind of play, but he gets by defenders with dekes at full speed, makes skilled plays to the net and can make plays in small areas. He's not a dynamic playmaker, but he'll have the odd play that will hit that level and his vision can surprise defenders. He has a shoot-first mentality and, for Lethbridge, would often be the team's shot off the flank on the man advantage. Cozens can be deployed in any situation and competes hard every shift with a bit of an edge to his game without taking a ton of penalties.

Lethbridge Hurricanes coach Brent Kisio on Cozens: “He's a difference maker. He's very fast and utilizes his speed very well. His playmaking abilities are exceptional. He's a reliable two-way player.”","The list of under-18 WHL players who've outproduced Cozens in the last four drafts is a short one. It consists of just Nolan Patrick (second overall) and Cody Glass (sixth overall). Cozens ranked third in my midseason ranking and remains one of the three players I strongly considered for that slot on the final list. Though he's less of a scorer than Patrick was at the same age and less of a playmaker than Glass was, Cozens is an inch taller, a better skater and arguably as strong as both players (with room to get stronger and add some muscle). Though I don't think he projects as a 1C on a contending team at the next level, Cozens has the makings of an up-tempo playmaking centre whose vision and puck protection (both in tight and out wide) can keep up with his feet and carry a top-six line offensively. He makes his wingers better and that will translate quickly to the NHL game (though he almost certainly goes back to junior for one more year).",,"A strong skater who has an explosive burst in space, Cozens has that combination of size and speed that tantalizes scouts. There have been some questions about his overall hockey sense and skill level, but it's hard to argue with how his physical tools translate, especially with the expectation that he will only get stronger and perhaps even more explosive.

Given that he played both center and wing this season, there is some caution in projecting his NHL ceiling. The lack of high-end puck skills suggests that he might not be a No. 1 pivot down the road. That said, he has some two-way capabilities, with the balance tilting more offensively.","There's no such thing as a guarantee when it comes to the draft. That said, I feel pretty damn comfortable projecting Dylan Cozens as a No. 1 centre in the NHL at some point in the not-so-distant future. Cozens possesses among the most mature games among centres in this year's class, with a strong work ethic that makes him an absolute nuisance for opposing forwards in the defensive zone. With the puck, Cozens is an electric skater who can make high-end plays at speed. No qualifying (10GP or more), first-time draft-eligible forward in the WHL played more than Cozen's estimated 14.5 minutes at 5-on-5 per game, and in those minutes, the Hurricanes outscored their opponents 78-40. The Hurricanes ratio of goal-control dropped by nearly 12 percent with Cozens on the bench. All the plaudits concerning Cozens' defensive acumen are well-earned. The stats speak for themselves.","Whichever team drafts Lethbridge Hurricanes centre Dylan Cozens should leave the draft feeling pretty good about themselves. They've likely added a future first-line centre to their prospect pool, albeit on the low-end of that spectrum.

There aren't many holes in Cozens' game if any at all. He already plays a mature two-way game, is extremely competitive, and possesses subtly high-end hockey sense that allows him to impact the game in every part of the ice. With Cozens on the ice, the Hurricanes had a plus-38 goal differential at 5-on-5 last season as proof positive. Cozens' skating is his best weapon. He can dart up and down the ice at lightning speed, and furthermore, likes to play with that pace when the puck is on his stick.","Cozens is an excellent combination of size, speed, and skill. Cozens is a very well-rounded player. He uses his size and speed to create space for his teammates. He also possesses an excellent shot. Considered by many to be NHL-ready, Cozens biggest knock at times is his lack of strength. Cozens projects as a high-end #2 center, and considered by many to be a “safe” pick in this year's draft.","Displaying an assortment of tantalizing tools, Cozens plays a highly effective 200-foot game. He's dominant on the puck and shows a highly cerebral sense on how to create space. He uses his quickness, size and skill to get to where he wants to go. He has quick acceleration, good agility and great speed. When he plays hungry on the puck he uses his skating to create gaps. There's even more power in his straight-away stride and he's effective slowing down play and winding his way to open ice. He's big, rangy and will be an even bigger force when he fills into his frame. His vision is top notch and he distributes the puck well in the offensive zone, but his passes could use more precision and power. His has a deadly shot with a quick release and can be a dual threat. He can pick corners and has good velocity on his wrister, although he has some work to do on his slap shot. He uses his body well to defend and grinds along the wall. He reads the play well defensively, has great positioning and an active stick, but lacks a bit intensity. He's solid at hunting down opponents and using his size and stick to battle for pucks. He shows emotion after the whistle and gets into engagements in defense of his team. His enthusiasm and energy is contagious."
2019,D,75.25,200,8,EDM,,Phili Broberg,"Broberg exploded onto the scene this season with a great Hlinka Gretzky tournament. He had good stretches in the Allsvenskan, some so-so stretches that coincided with an illness and he finished off strong at the U18s. His value comes from his athleticism. He's a 6-foot-3 defenseman who is an elite skater. That combination alone is scary. There are some rushes he's made this season where the opposition didn't even have a chance to get a stick on the puck because he needs a few steps and he's blazing by guys. However, I found in league games he was hesitant to push the pace versus men like he did versus his peers. He has that ability and it may be a maturation thing. Broberg is divisive due to his offensive upside. I think there is some offense to his game. He executes give-and-goes in a clever way to make the most of his skating, he moves the puck decent on the power play, and he flashes both good handling and distributing skills. He can be careless with the puck too, and often I've seen him make terrible turnovers, but I've also seen a few high-level plays with the puck. If you're expecting more, you'll be disappointed. But if you want a two-way defenseman with size who can close a gap, man a second power play and transition the offense at even strength at a high level, he's your man.

AIK manager Anders Gozzi on Broberg: “Broberg has enormous potential and will play in the NHL in the near future. He is one of the best defenders we have gotten in AIK throughout the years due to his skating and skill level.”","Is Broberg a player whose post-Hlinka hype surpassed the reality of his game? Yes. That has always been my view. Does Broberg still have a lot to offer? Absolutely. When you have the length that he does and you can still skate as he can, you've got a lot to work with. The raw talent is exciting because it shows up in flashes in games when he joins the rush and carries the puck through the neutral zone. But I still have concerns about his decision-making as well as his puck handling (there are way too many bobbles at the offensive zone blueline that go the other way). He also struggles to make high-end plays with the puck once his speed has pushed him over the offensive zone blueline. In the right program, there's no question that there's a lot to tap into. But there's definitely a lot of risk associated with taking him in the first half of the first round.",,"One of the best pure skaters in this draft, Broberg has all of the tools to eventually become a top-four defenseman in the NHL. There have been some moderate concerns about his hockey sense and playmaking abilities, but I think those will catch up to his feet eventually. He makes pretty good reads in the offensive zone, distributes well from the defensive zone and can use his feet in transition as well as, or better than, any defenseman in this draft. Broberg has a very good, quick and accurate shot from the point, looking for open lanes and possessing the mobility to find the best option. The biggest issue I see at this point is an overreliance on his skating, to a point where it might not work at the next level like it does now. But his defending has improved over the course of the season, and his size and athleticism go a long way for him.",,"In terms of sheer physical ability, I'd have a difficult time naming five players in this year's Draft who have an edge on Philip Broberg. He's one of the absolute best skaters in this class, with great balance, acceleration and a blazing top-gear. When Broberg gets going, it's something to behold.

The problem? Broberg might have the worst hockey sense of any of the top defensive prospects in this year's draft. His ability to sense pressure with the puck on his stick in the defensive zone is awful. In most cases, a player with Broberg's decision making and hockey sense deficiencies wouldn't land in my first round. Hell, they might be on my ‘Do Not Draft' board. That said, I see the physical tools in Broberg's game, and I do think that if he puts it all together, he can be a top pair defenceman in the NHL.

Broberg is perhaps the biggest boom-or-bust prospect in this year's draft.","Some scouts have Broberg as high as a top 10 in this year's draft. While he may have the skating and size to make him a decent prospect, Broberg's overall game has struggled this season. He struggled to put up points in Sweden's 2nd division, and he makes questionable decisions with the puck at times. With time, Broberg may turn into a strong 2nd pairing defender. He is likely 3-4 years away from the NHL.","A puck-moving defenseman with a big frame, Broberg utilizes his big body very well and once he gets some speed, he's very hard to knock off the puck. He's a great skater with strong powerful strides, especially when his agility, quickness and acceleration all come together. He makes quick side-to-side movements and is quite elusive. If he can maintain his speed, he can get past an opponent one-on-one. When he doesn't have the puck in his possession, he is still a threat offensively and likes to join the rush to create odd-man advantages. He's very mobile on the offensive blue line and he's constantly moving and trying to find open ice. Overall, he's a very good passer and can make smart plays to set up his teammates in the offensive zone. Able to fire wrist shots through traffic, but he seems to lack shot strength and accuracy. Defensively, he plays a simple but active game. He makes good reads and intercepts passes in the neutral zone. He also has an active stick with good reach while playing in his own zone. He uses his big frame well and is a tough opponent to win a board battle against. On the downside, he sometimes seems to be too one-sided and opponents quickly learn his patterns. He needs to learn when to carry the puck himself and when to use his teammates."
2019,C,72.25,173,9,ANA,,Trevor Zegras,"Zegras was fantastic all season for the USNTDP and was a go-to guy for the program when they needed a goal. In terms of pure offensive skill, he's the best in the draft class. He's a special playmaker and one of the best passers I've seen as a first-year draft-eligible in recent years. It's not just that he sees the options, it's also the fact his timing is elite in terms of when to execute plays, and he has the high-end skill to feather pucks into the right spots. His imagination gets the highest praise from me. He's made some very creative one-touch plays where he's knocking pucks that were behind him onto the sticks of teammates or firing a bullet pass while spinning with the puck on his backhand. He's known as a playmaker but has a sneaky good shot and can pick a corner if you give him time. Zegras has fine speed, very good edge work and hands to evade checks. He can push the pace when he wants to, but for a small, slight forward, he slows it down a bit too much for me. He's not the biggest or bulkiest pivot and has at times played wing this season, but he's gotten steadily better in the physical parts of the game and will push back when opponents get physical with him. Zegras isn't a guy who you pick to run over guys, though; you're drafting him to slot onto the half-wall of your first power play and get the puck to the scorers on his wing for a decade.

USNTDP center Jack Hughes on Zegras: “He's the most creative player on our team. He thinks outside the box, he's really smart and super crafty with his hands and movements. He's really slippery. He's an easy guy to play with knowing he'll always give you great passes.”","If Hughes is the best passer in the draft, Zegras is the clear No. 2 (which isn't a knock on Ryan Suzuki, Dach or Krebs). I have two complaints with Zegras' game (otherwise there's a lot to like, from his ability to hang onto the puck to the job he does supporting the puck and winning back possession). The first is that he passes a little too much. Zegras has this uncanny ability to find small seams in the offensive zone with precision and pace and it means that everyone who plays with him (forwards and defencemen) have to be ready to receive a pass or moving to get open. But there are also times (not infrequently) when he ought to drive the net or use what is actually a pretty dangerous, quick release. The second concern is one of discipline. Zegras' physicality makes him the defensive presence that he is and enables him to come out of 50/50 battles more often than not but he can let it get the best of him and his talents are better utilized through his playmaking abilities rather than in the penalty box.",,"An elite playmaker with exceptional puck skills, Zegras is one of the most entertaining players in this draft class. He played both center and wing this season, though most teams I've talked to project him as a center with top-six ceiling. With elite vision and passing skills, Zegras is excellent in dictating play from the half wall or making plays on the rush. He can play at any speed and can back defenders down coming through the neutral zone. His ability to gain the zone is rivaled only by Hughes' in the draft class, as Zegras has creativity and a good sense of how to find the soft areas to give him the best chance to make plays. He has a quick release and can score goals but is viewed more as a pass-first player.

The biggest area of improvement for Zegras is his physical strength. NHL teams have consistently noted Zegras' frame when offering criticisms. He appears to have the frame to support more weight and muscle to allow him to maximize his potential, but considering the way someone such as Elias Pettersson operates, you wonder if it's an absolute necessity. He also seems to force plays sometimes, but I think that became less of a problem as this past season progressed.","On paper, there is so much to like about Trevor Zegras' game. He's one of the most productive players in the history of the USNTDP (a common theme among this year's graduates); he can play centre or the wing; he's committed to an excellent program at Boston University. Hell, even to the naked eye, there's a lot to like. Zegras has blazing speed and plays a sound, mature two-way game. 

Yet, I remain unconvinced of this player's upside. My concern is that Zegras, like Oliver Wahlstrom this year, will find that creating offence without Jack Hughes on your line is considerably more difficult at the NCAA level. Zegras' physical tools are undeniable, but the lack of offensive creativity concerns me. In my viewings, I've seen a player that attacks offensively as if by chainsaw where the precision of a scalpel would suffice; I'd like to see Zegras change speeds when he attacks to throw off defencemen and create space, for one example.

Perhaps that refinement will come with time, and as it does, Zegras will become a top of the lineup scoring threat for whichever team drafts him. I'm just not ready to take that risk myself any lower than the '20s.","No player ranking from my pre-U18 list incited as many raised eyebrows as Trevor Zegras at No. 21. Rightly so. Lord forgive me, for I have sinned. He's clearly so much better than I gave credit.

The problem at the time was I just hadn't seen anything that aligned with the hype that so many scouts were heaping on him throughout the season. In response to the outcry, I went back, rewatched some tape, tried to find new stuff, crunched numbers — you name it.

Now, I see the light. It became clear that Zegras was among the best, most creative playmakers in his entire class. His skating is, in my estimation, high-end, though I've come across some in the industry that are convinced it's a weakness. Zegras shot is just okay, and I wonder about his decision-making sometimes. It's why I didn't go all-in and catapult him into my top ten altogether. There is definitely No. 2 centre upside present in Zegras' game though.","Zegras is one of the best, if not the best playmaker in this year's draft. Even though he was the third line center on a stacked USTNDP team, he still managed to put up well over a point a game. Zegras has a unique ability to create space by holding onto the puck and using his elite hockey sense to find open teammates. He plays with a high compete level and does have an excellent shot, though his first instinct is to pass. Scouts are intrigued by what kind of player he could be with increased minutes. Zegras projects as a low-end #1 playmaking center at the NHL level.","A playmaking forward with great positional awareness, Zegras has the innovative ability to create chances for teammates in all situations. A slippery and shifty skater, he has exceptional foot mechanics and clean edges that allow him to be evasive. He has some slick edges, which helps him quickly break out from his own zone while pushing the pace. He owns a decent top speed that helps him create separation in the neutral zone to join odd-man rushes effectively. He processes information quickly and plays the game at high speed. A dynamic and exciting player, he possesses a lot of high-end skills and tremendous creativity with the puck. A skilled and creative playmaker, he sees the ice well and can advance the puck to open teammates with sneaky passes through defenders. His playmaking abilities make him very unpredictable in possession of the puck and he's able to find teammates easily from anywhere in the offensive end. His ability to gain the centre of the ice in a flash is a rare skill that is highly valuable. He has really soft hands which he uses to dangle through traffic without problem and excellent puck control on his backhand shot. He's a dangerous finisher, who's able to get in the right spots to become an offensive threat. He's very evasive along the wall and able to emerge from board battles with the puck on his stick."
2019,RW,72.75,196,10,VAN,,Vasily Podkolzin,"Podkolzin played a lot of hockey this season between multiple levels of junior, pro and international hockey, and impressed almost every single time. He almost always seems to have an impact on a game. He's super talented but also an elite competitor. Podkolzin can make the flashy plays to deke defenders, but he rarely does that off a standstill or along the walls. He has hard skill. Podkolzin is typically full speed ahead to the net; and if he needs to go around or through you, he will. He's also a very good playmaker and finisher who can take advantage of space if defenders make off him by making a pass or sniping from a distance. Quite often he made passes this season that were elite, but he didn't rack up that many assists. The one thing that bugs me about him is his skating. His stride is a little awkward and inefficient, he's hunched over, kicks his heels out, but he generates decent speed and hustles so hard that any technical flaw isn't that exposed. He has two years left on his KHL contract with SKA and told The Athletic he intends to see that contract out.

Russian U18 coach Vladimir Filatov on Podkolzin: “He's the heart of a team. He always wants to set an example on and off the ice. He's maybe not the most elite skill player or an elite sniper, but he's a leader, he runs the game. His game is always about controlling the puck, pushing the play forward and putting everything on the net.”","Podkolzin has age on his side (June 24, 2001) but his play has continued to leave me wanting more. The skill set is there. He gets to his top speed quickly and his top speed is a lot to handle in transition (more north-south than east-west), he's physical, has excellent hands and he can really — and I mean really — shoot it (though his drawback is a little too long for my liking). It all goes back to knowing how to use the skill that I touched on above. Podkolzin is an instinctual player who makes plays for himself but struggles to involve his teammates and the end result is a contrast between what your eyes tell you (they notice him a lot) and how effective he actually is. He has time to figure the rest of it out but it's extremely hard to be a dominant NHL player on skill and skill alone. Teams don't want to use a top-10 pick on a player who may become a checking third-liner who can play with pace and irritate teams but doesn't actually produce all that much. There's room for him to be a lot more than that but he needs to put all of the pieces together and I'm more certain today than I was in my midseason ranking that his top-five buzz is unwarranted.",,"He has become a hot draft topic because of his relatively quiet finish to the season and the fact that he remains under KHL contract for the next two years. The fact that his rights are owned by SKA St. Petersburg causes some nervousness, as the club tends to hold on to guys. It's important to note, however, that Podkolzin is represented by Newport Sports in North America, and it's hard to imagine it'd take on a client who didn't plan to come over at some point.

Podkolzin remains an exceptional talent, with high-end skill and power in his game. He has a mean streak, gets on pucks quickly and can finish. Podkolzin wasn't dominating in the same way at the end of the season, and his club play was underwhelming, but I've maintained all year that he was never put in a great position to succeed this season because he played at three different levels in Russia. But when Podkolzin is at his best, few in this class are better. He does a little bit of everything and does almost all of it very well.","There might not be a single player in this draft whose tape I've enjoyed as much as Vasili Podkolzin. He's a throwback power forward, capable of bulldozing his way through a defensive pair with ease and taking the puck to the net for a goal or a Grade-A scoring chance on any shift. Podkolzin has silky smooth mitts to match that power and is a strong skater with a determined work ethic who seems only capable of playing at full-speed. The fact that Podkolzin works even harder without the puck is going to endear him to his coaches — seems basic enough, but it's not always a given with players in this age group. This play is a perfect example of the type of three-zone player Podkolzin is. That Podkolzin is throwing that two-for-one hit to dispossess the opposition of the puck in a VHL game, against men, just highlights what an absolute unit he is. ","I've gone on record, several times, expressing the joy that I get from watching Vasili Podkolzin play hockey. Even if Podkolzin's rank took a hit from the pre-U18 spot at No. 3 overall, I still feel that way about the way he plays the game. He's a bull in a china shop. A throwback power forward who can take over a hockey game on a moment's notice; the type of player that general managers covet in the playoffs. Even though Podkolzin didn't show as well as many had hoped in the U18 tournament, I'm not quite ready to cast him from the top ten entirely. We're talking about a seven-game sample, after all. I'm similarly unphased by his supposed lack of production in the MHL, a league that isn't exactly renowned for its scoring — people made the same arguments about Florida Panthers first-round pick Grigori Denisenko last year. Besides, Podkolzin put up decent numbers in the Russian men's league, the VHL, which is one tier removed from the KHL. Unfortunately for Podkolzin, Turcotte and Byram happened to show as the better prospects over the full-year sample. They also have the premium position angle going for them.","Podkolzin can be a bit of a polarizing prospect. He is one of the most exciting players to watch in the draft. He is a tenacious forechecker who isn't afraid to crash the net. He also possesses excellent offensive skills. Podkolzin's biggest knock was his inability to put up points in the leagues he was playing in. However, he also played for a number of different teams and lacked consistent linemates. Overall, Podzolkin has all the tools to be a successful top 6 winger power forward in the NHL. He will likely spend the next two seasons playing in Russia, as he is still under contract.","His incredible speed is just the beginning of his skill and not only can he skate hard and fast straight, his side-to-side motion helps him create some jaw-dropping plays. His puck control is high end and he has incredible vision with the puck. Not just able to dangle and toe drag, he knows how to make great passes tape-to-tape. His play helps create scoring chances for his teammates, too. A force to be reckoned with each time he is on the ice, his explosive skating and speed help him carry the puck with ease. Always knows where to be on the ice and his ability to keep the play alive helps his team's possession numbers. He's dangerous on the power play and a consistent scoring threat. He's also known for his two-way game and is consistently engaged in the defensive zone. Willing to sacrifice his body to block shots and never backs down from a puck battle. His style is in a category of its own and his unpredictable play makes it hard for defenses to read him. His hockey IQ is outstanding and he plays with an energy and creativity that is rare for players his age. Always assessing his options on the ice, he is smart, patient and not mistake prone. His love for the game shows in his play and he is fun to watch. His size is the only knock on this player."
2019,D,72,182,11,ARI,,Victor Soderstrom,"Soderstrom started the season in junior but quickly moved up to the SHL level, logging significant minutes and getting power play time as a 17-year-old. Soderstrom is a great puck mover, showing high-end IQ moving the puck and ice in his veins under pressure. Sometimes he's a little too calm, letting guys close in on him and trying to be too cute, but typically he's efficient on zone exits. He's smooth with the puck, but has very quick hands, and is able to make plays through defenders from a standstill and off the rush. There were several times this season his game popped with a wow-caliber skill play. For a smaller guy, his game could have more speed. His skating looks fine when he winds up and get going, but he lacks explosiveness and doesn't have a ton of pace in his game. Despite his size, he's a good defender. He closes gaps very well due to his IQ, using his body and stick to break up pucks, and makes a lot of stops.","SOderstrOm is one of those players who will surely go higher than my ranking but whom I've watched a lot of in order to make sure my differing view of his game is grounded, hopefully, in reality. His stride is nearly flawless. His blades hardly touch the ice when he's extending through his body in straight lines, they're feathery on his crossovers laterally and he's nearly as fast skating backward as he is forward. Because he's also really physical for his size, that skating ability allows him to play a tight gap defensively and close on forwards to lay hits along the boards in the neutral zone, forcing dump-ins as a result. Though his shot isn't hard, he does a good job using his feet to get his wristers through and he isn't afraid to open up for the one-timer (something I would argue he uses too much on D-to-D plays at the point when a more effective pass is available). You can see both that shot and that neutral zone aggression at play here. My only major concern with Soderstrom's game is one of upside. There's no question he's ahead of his peers but two major issues persist:

He loses a lot of board battles due to strength and he doesn't mitigate against that effectively with his stick (though that can be taught, which is good).
I don't see enough high-end playmaking ability to his game to view him as more than a second-pairing defenceman at the NHL level and I'm not sure his power play use in the SHL will translate to the NHL.",,"A remarkably poised and mature defenseman, Soderstrom spent much of this season playing in the Swedish professional ranks. Before suffering a concussion at the under-18 World Championship, he showcased his puck-moving talent and high-end hockey sense. However, I don't know that there's anything in particular that stands out about Soderstrom aside from the way he thinks the game. The skill is fine, the passing is good-to-great, his shot is OK and he gets pucks out of the zone well. He might be a jack of all trades but a master of none. Hockey sense can carry a player a long way, however.","The question that many scouts will grapple with when deciding on Victor Soderstrom's spot on their board is how much offensive upside does he possess. Because as a first-year draft-eligible defenceman in the SHL (something that portends exceedingly well for his NHL future), Soderstrom was nothing short of brilliant in the defensive zone — his reads were great; he always puts the puck in good places; he holds up physically under duress. 

If Soderstrom built on some of the offensive dynamism that he showed in two games at the Hlinka-Gretzky tournament last summer, there's no doubt he'd be closer to ten on my board. Thing is — he didn't. Without proof of concept beyond a two-game summer tournament, it's hard to imagine that's likely to change.","I'm not sure that Brynas IF defenceman Victor Soderstrom has the highest upside of any of the defencemen in this class behind Byram, but he absolutely has the highest floor of any player in that position. Soderstrom, who only turned 18 in February, played top-four minutes virtually all season in the SHL and held up quite well given the circumstances.

There is just so much maturity to the way that Soderstrom plays the game. His puck retrievals are excellent, as Soderstrom always shoulder checks for a read on incoming pressure and surveys the ice for an outlet. He makes a superb first pass and can skate the puck out of his zone reasonably well, too. His battle level is through the roof.

About that upside question, though. Those concerns aren't unwarranted. Soderstrom didn't really flash a whole lot in the way of offensive skill this season, aside from some interesting moments at the Hlinka-Gretzky tournament last summer. I do wonder, though, how much of that is a result of the fact that Soderstrom was just trying to keep his head above water playing against men in Sweden — that would certainly be understandable.","Soderstrom saw his stock climb as the season progressed and is now solidified in the top 20 prospects in the draft. Soderstrom is a two-way defender with excellent skating ability. He is a prototypical Swedish defender, and he excelled playing against men last season. Soderstrom projects as a two-way, 2nd pairing defender at the NHL level. He is likely 2-3 years away.","Considered a two-way defenseman, he keeps the game simple defensively, but he still stands out. While not an overly physical player, he makes his presence on the ice known in other ways and never gives up on pucks along the boards. He doesn't take many risks, so his passes are safe and usually calculated. While he isn't the fastest skater on the ice, he is still quick, mobile and smooth. Good at clearing pucks in his own end, but from time to time he finds himself out of position as he is eager to track down his opponent. Confident with the puck, he is a responsible player who plays with poise and patience. Rarely makes mistakes with his high hockey IQ. Generally, makes good decisions but can sometimes try to do too much and put himself out of position as a result. Offensively, he can jump into the play and join rushes, but should take more shots than he makes passes as he has a powerful shot. He's great at causing turnovers and has a knack for making great first passes. Expected to be an offensive defenseman and has a very high upside. Calm, confident and simple; all the makings of a responsible penalty killer. Loads of potential and if anything, his biggest knock is that he sometimes tries to do too much."
2019,LW,74,196,12,MIN,,Matt Boldy,"Boldy didn't join the USNTDP as a top prospect, in fact, he was on the bubble to make the team. A sudden growth spurt combined with a great skill level spiked his prospect stock. Boldy is a unique winger in how he plays the game. His combination of puck skills and hockey IQ are among the best in the draft. His hand-eye coordination is off the charts. Pucks stick to him. He's also incredibly creative and made some of the best passes I saw all season. I wouldn't call him a natural playmaker, though; he prefers to play below the dots and around the net rather than QB a power play. While he's a great passer, Boldy has a quality shot and was often used as a trigger guy from the slot. Boldy's consistency was an issue this season. When competing hard, he's often catching unsuspecting players on the backcheck and gets to the net to score. However, he had stretches this season where he didn't impact games, and sometimes they were long stretches. His main weakness over the years was his skating. I think it's improved to an average level, but he's not a powerful skater and his stride could be cleaned up.

USNTDP U18 coach John Wroblewski on Boldy: “Boldy grew from 5-foot-10 to 6-foot-2. His development trajectory has been steep. He can be a power forward. He has excellent hands and vision. He can finish, he can run a power play, he can be a net-front guy. The puck is attached to him.”","Boldy's biggest skill has quickly become being whatever the national program needs him to be. Last year, that meant being the U17 team's go-to offensive winger when Caufield played for the U18 team. This year, it meant being a jack-of-all-trades. On some lines he became a slot-option scorer, on others he became a forechecking passer. By year's end, on a new line with Turcotte and Bobby Brink, he was exposing teams as the third-leading scorer at U18 Worlds. Boldy's versatility is a tremendous asset. He put up big numbers without getting the offensive opportunities afforded to a player like Caufield. Though Boldy lacks the high-end speed of many of the players near the top of this draft, I wouldn't say his skating holds him back because he does such a good job finding space and getting open (he doesn't need to blow by a defender for a breakaway in order to generate). Boldy and Alex Newhook are going to complement each other extremely well at Boston College next season and I wouldn't be surprised if either of them are one-and-done.",,"Boldy grew nearly 4 inches the past two years but never lost the puck skills and creativity that he had when he didn't have the size. He is a wing who plays more like a center, a true 200-foot player who is as valuable defensively as he is offensively. That toolkit is rare, and he's only going to get better as he continues to get stronger. Boldy could afford to improve his skating some -- he does not have breakaway speed -- but he still gets around the sheet effectively.

In the offensive end, Boldy has higher-end puck skills and creativity. He can make the plays in small areas and has an excellent, heavy, accurate shot. Boldy also possesses excellent vision and an ability to make accurate passes off the backhand and forehand. His versatility and consistent effort mean he can be plugged in just about anywhere.","There is so, so, so much to like about Matthew Boldy's game. You want a power winger? Boldy can drop the shoulder, pick up speed, and drive the net with his 6-foot-2 frame clearing all in his path. You want a distributor? As many have pointed out, Boldy's reputation was once that of a playmaking winger. You need a sniper? Boldy lovesto shoot the puck, and with good reason — that wrist shot of his is hard to stop. Unlike some of the other high-profile wingers in the USNTDP, Boldy played mostly with Turcotte or Trevor Zegras as his pivot — he spent little time with Hughes. In some cases, Boldy had to be the player that stirred the drink on his line, and he seemed to relish the role. Boldy is an active puck-carrier, eager to transition play through the neutral zone, and capable of making plays at speed.","There isn't much that USNTDP winger Matthew Boldy can't do. He's a highly-effective offensive winger with size, standing at 6-foot-2, and fantastic hands and puck skills — he's especially proficient on his backhand, as  noted in this article for EP Rinkside. The biggest concern with Boldy's game is that he's not the greatest skater, which limits his ability to play the power game anywhere near as effectively as he could if he had an extra bit of pep in his step. If he can sort that out in time for the jump to the NHL, though, Boldy has the potential to do a lot of damage in the professional ranks.","Similar to Cozens, Boldy possesses an excellent combination of size, speed, and skill. More of a goal-scorer than a playmaker, Boldy uses his strength down low to consistently create scoring chances. He also isn't afraid to use his excellent shot to attempt to score from the slot and off the rush. Boldy's big shot is his calling card. His biggest need for growth is in well-rounding his game and being more consistent overall. Boldy projects as a top 6 goal scoring winger at the NHL level and will likely be NHL ready in two years.","A versatile offensive forward, Boldy possesses elite vision, an excellent first pass in the offensive zone as well as high-end skating ability. He has some slick, deceptive edges and a smooth stride that help him escape pressure with ease. He protects the puck well, thanks to his strong edges and good strength. His ability to consistently enter the zone with control and speed helps his team hold onto possession of the puck and maintain pressure for solid periods of time. His stellar passing abilities are a big part of his game. He looks like he will develop into a top-line playmaker at the next level and could be lethal as the set-up man on the power play, but he can also carry his own in the goal-scoring department. He has smooth hands that make him dangerous in one-on-one battles. He has a powerful wrist shot and a good backhand shot that he loves to use near the net. Able to maneuver in high traffic areas with the puck on his stick without losing possession. With his big frame, he can take the puck to the net and screen goaltenders effectively. Also displays nice net-front presence as smaller opponents don't have much of a chance to win positioning battles against him. He's decent in his own zone as well, as he is very involved in board battles and covers his man well."
2019,G,75.5,193,13,FLA,,Spencer Knight,,,,"Knight is the top goaltender in the draft by a large margin -- although not a lock for the first round as the season wore on, especially after his numbers trended down a bit over the course of the season. The things that makes Knight exceptional among his goaltending peers is elite hockey sense, tremendous athleticism balanced with controlled play, great footwork and size and elite puck-moving abilities. I don't put huge value on a goalie's puckhandling skills, but Knight's are so good it's hard not to mention. Knight has really grown a lot in his confidence and poise in the net. There's such little flash in Knight's game, and that's a good thing. He's just always in the right spot because he tracks and anticipates as well as any goalie prospect I've seen in the past few years.",,,"Knight is the best goalie available in this draft. Boasting a large frame, excellent instincts, and athleticism, Knight is considered by many to be a future #1 goalie in the NHL. Unfortunately, goalies are extremely hard to project, and Knight is no exception. While his tools are excellent, time will tell if he can turn into a #1 goalie at the NHL level. Many compare his demeanor to Montreal Canadiens star Carey Price, which is a good sign.","A monster-sized, athletic, puck stopper, Knight is fundamentally sound and mature in his play. He shows a strong understanding of the technical side of the position and a calm fluidity in his movements. His size allows him to cover a lot of the net naturally and he uses his pads to seal off the ice with ease. When moving, he stays tight and compact in order to minimize any openings. He has quick feet and explosive mobility when needing to move post-to-post quickly. He's also able to push off the goal line quickly to get to the top of his crease, cutting off shooting angles for the opposition. He rarely moves out of control. Strong structural positioning doesn't hamper his ability to make a desperation save. He has plenty of patience in his game, though. Efficient in his movement, he's calm and moves to the top of his crease to cut angles instinctively. He also positions his shoulder posture well and uses his glove to help close off the upper portion of the net. He uses a quick glove hand to snag pucks and also has a solid blocker that he uses to punch pucks out of high-danger areas. Traps plenty of pucks as well, eating up shots to control or eliminate rebounds altogether. He has the mental makeup to quickly forget a bad goal or bad outing and regain focus."
2019,D,71.25,172,14,PHI,,Cameron York,"York was the No. 1 defenseman on the NTDP this past season, the main power play QB for most of the season and had one of the most productive statistical careers ever by an NTDP defender. York's hockey sense is what makes him so valuable. His poise with the puck is fantastic. He's never pressured into bad decisions and exhibits great vision. His teammates constantly praise what a calming influence he is when he has the puck. York has a high skill level but often does not lean on his stick handling, preferring to make a play to his forwards. York skates well. He lacks a dynamic top gear you'd like in a small defenseman, but he can skate pucks out of trouble or into the offensive zone. He defends well due to his feet and great brain, but it will be interesting to see how that translates versus men, as I wouldn't call him a top-tier defender.","It's hard to believe, given just how great York's season was, that I still think he has flown under the radar in scouting circles in terms of just how talented he is. Part of that is probably driven by the strength of this national development program forward crop but York is a star in his own right and is clearly the second-best defencemen in this draft for me. While Hughes and Caufield were making headlines for their record-breaking seasons, York was putting together a campaign (1.03 points per game) that surpassed Erik Johnson (0.94) and Adam Fox (0.92) to set the national program's record for points by a defenceman with 65. He should have been named the top defenceman at U18 Worlds over Philip Broberg, too. York doesn't have the flash, the speed, or the lateral quickness of program alum Quinn Hughes but he plays one of the most efficient games you'll see out of an 18-year-old defenceman, he picks his spots to activate as a shooter, he find forwards in transition or across the zone without hesitating and he's an excellent man-on-man defender despite lacking strength. He's going to be really, really good in today's NHL.",,"York is often described as the modern-day defenseman. He very quietly set the national team development program's single-season record for points by a defenseman with 65. He was playing his best hockey at the end of the season, making a bunch of plays with his superior passing abilities and vision. He jumps into plays with relative ease and has good instincts for when he has to get back. I thought his defensive game improved greatly over the past two seasons without sacrificing offense. Odds are, when York is on the ice, his team is going to have the puck an awful lot. His puck retrievals and sense for getting out of his own zone are among the best in this draft because he follows that first touch with decisive play. He still has to round out his game more and continue to build strength as an average-sized defenseman, but there's a lot to like in what he's done and how he progressed this season.","While the point production of Cam York is undeniable, and a deciding factor in his rapid rise this year up draft boards, I remain skeptical of how much of that is as a result of environment or the player itself. While York is a fantastic skater in every sense of the word, I don't see someone with a great deal of offensive creativity. The lack of a big-time point shot doesn't help either.

Ultimately, I see York as more of a two-way guy than a dynamic offensive defenceman capable of quarterbacking an NHL power play. That's not necessarily a knock on York either. Players that can move the puck as well as York and defend as capably as he does (York owed a 77 percent goals for at 5-on-5) have a part to play in today's NHL. 

We'll learn more about York's game as he transitions to the University of Michigan next season. It's a program desperate for an offensive producer from the blue line in the wake of Quinn Hughes' graduation to the NHL. Until then, I remain skeptical, and that's why he's sitting at 20 on my board, whereas the consensus rankings have him at about 14th.","Don't let Cam York's gaudy point totals fool you. This isn't the second coming of Quinn Hughes. He's not built to run a first unit power play at the NHL level, and even the most optimistic projections rate him as the type of defenceman that can hit 30 points on a season-to-season basis.

What York does have going for him, though, is a smooth skating stride that allows him to transition the puck up ice with ease. The escapability to lead a breakout from the depths of the defensive zone with heavy offensive pressure and leave unscathed. York's the modern, puck-moving, two-way defenceman. York's best attribute is his hockey sense. He can read the defensive zone incredibly well and anticipate plays well before they happen. In the offensive zone, York does a decent job of seizing opportunities as they present themselves. If he had a better shot, maybe he'd have first-unit power play potential at the NHL level, even. Instead, you're looking at someone who profiles as a highly effective second pair defenceman. If a team can find that at 16th overall, they have to leave the draft feeling pretty damn good about how things turned out.","York is a stereotypical modern defenseman. Though small in stature, York possesses excellent skating and puck moving ability. At times, York struggles to handle larger competition in the defensive zone. However, his overall play contributes to strong possession by his team, and his offensive ability helps create scoring chances. York projects as a high end second pairing defender at the NHL level. He is likely 2-3 years away.","An incredibly gifted defender, York can play elite-level hockey in all three zones. His skating is among the best of all the defensemen in this draft class. His skating is so silky smooth, it allows him to float around the ice and be in the perfect position to not only defend his blue line, but gain controlled zone entry into the offensive zone. He utilizes his speed and edges really well to keep a good gap while creating space for himself in the defensive and offensive zones respectively. A fundamental defensive defenseman, he's poised in his own zone and has tremendous hockey smarts. In his own zone, York is quick to attack oncoming forecheckers with good contact and pressure with his stick. He does a great job of moving the puck out of his own zone. He's also skilled on offense, proving to be adept at carrying the puck through the neutral zone and utilizing his high-end puck skills to make a clean zone entry. He's then able to push back defenders while opening up passing and shooting lanes. He shows good patience with the puck to wait out defenders and make smart passing plays to the front of the net. A highly-entertaining player, he still needs to fill out his frame. Scouts have been impressed with his overall poise and skill as well as his maturity level."
2019,RW,67.25,163,15,MON,,Cole Caufield,"Caufield scored 72 goals this past season. That wasn't a typo. He's one of the best goal-scorers to become eligible for the draft in recent years. Caufield's shot is special. There's plenty of snipers out there, but Caufield's wrist shot technique is like a slingshot. He gets control of the puck and fires it a million miles an hour on target. He's not going to pick a corner every shot, but his finishing rate is very good and he scored some of the most amazing goals I saw all season at any level.  He's got a good one-timer/slap shot, but it's his wrist shot that is special. He's more than a shot, as in most games Caufield would have four-plus scoring chances. Part of that was due to having Hughes as his linemate, but mostly it was due to Caufield's skill set. His puck skills are fantastic. Every touch he makes is smooth. He can make the 1-on-1 plays versus defenders, but he has such quick, crisp touches that it allows him to get so many clean shots. His offensive timing is excellent, and he reads how plays develop very well. He's got great vision, with the ability to make plays in open ice and off the rush. He's not as great a skater as you'd hope for 5-foot-7, but he's an above-average speedster who can flash a tier above. His size is his main drawback, but Caufield competes well and attacks the net to score goals. There are ways to pick apart his game. I've done it plenty watching him the past two years, but at the end of the day, he scored 72 goals. It's a lot of goals.

USNTDP U18 coach John Wroblewski on Caufield: “I've never seen purer hands coming through the NTDP. When he catches a puck, it lays flat. Every pass or shot explodes off his stick. It's not the flashy dangles, it's pure, it's clean. His shot is so accurate. He hits so many crossbars and elbows in practice, it's insane.”","Cole Caufield is to comparable shooters in this draft to what Jango Fett was to stormtroopers. The gap has become so pronounced that they'd be prudent to just clone him. Also, he's short.

Seriously, though: Caufield is brilliant and his size doesn't concern me. He had no trouble keeping up with the best skater in the draft and though his numbers are certainly inflated by playing most of the season with the best passer in the draft (Hughes is the best at a lot of things, you're probably noticing), Caufield's ability to release with speed, release from a standstill, score with his one-timer and go to his backhand is crazy-impressive. Couple those things with his knack for finding space, getting to rebounds and sliding in and out of traffic and you've got a player who will be a dominant scoring threat at the University of Wisconsin next season — and someday in the NHL. Caufield's biggest challenge will be driving a line on his own and involving his teammates a little more when he doesn't have a player as talented as Hughes doing that for him.",,"It isn't just that Caufield scored 72 goals this season, the most by any draft-eligible player in junior hockey by 21 goals. It's also how he scores them. Yes, Caufield is slight, but he has elite offensive sense. I haven't seen a prospect who has as keen a sense of time and space, and opponents have a hard time tracking Caufield on the ice. He's always moving, finding openings before anyone knows they're there. Combine that skill with an elite shot that isn't as heavy as it is ridiculously quick and accurate.

He has often been compared to Chicago Blackhawks winger Alex DeBrincat, but I -- and a few scouts I've talked to -- think Caufield is better than DeBrincat was at the same age. He's a little quicker and perhaps a little more skilled. He is especially tenacious, playing the game without fear and getting the most out of his 5-foot-7 frame. Is he a risk to be picked high in the draft? Not any more than anyone else. Everyone needs goals. He scores them and will continue to in the NHL.","There are at least 20 teams in the NHL kicking themselves for letting Alex Debrincat slip past them in the 2016 Draft. For those who believe that Cole Caufield can be that type of player at the next level, it's hard to imagine that happening again. This time the diminutive scorer who's done nothing but dominate at every level will have to prove he can't do it in the NHL — just like any other first-round talent.

It's becoming increasingly common to hear Caufield's name cited as the best pure goal-scorer in this class. It's also easy to see why that's the case — those 54 goals are some kind of impressive. Caufield has an excellent wrist shot, with a quick, hard release that most goalies can't see, much less stop.  Not that I disagree with Caufield's title as the premier goal-scorer of this year's draft, but I think it undersells his playmaking ability. Don't let his low assist counts fool you — Caufield can beat a defence any which way he wants. Based on the sample of data that I've tracked, Caufield has a ridiculous 93 percent completion rate on his passes and creates dangerous shot attempts at a respectable clip. My theory is that Caufield's assists don't reflect his ability because he's mostly feeding those passes to playmakers.","No question about it — Cole Caufield is this draft's best pure goal scorer. If there was ever even a shred of doubt about that lingering in the minds of scouts and draft analysts, Caufield summarily dismissed them with 14 goals in seven games at the U18s.

Even if one wants to try and dismiss Caufield as ‘one-dimensional,' his one dimension is the most important one in hockey — scoring goals –, and he's pretty damn good at it, too. Caufield possesses a quick-release wrist shot that he can fire with laser-like precision, at lightning speed past goaltenders. He's able to adapt the release point of his shot depending on the situation in front of him to create deception or alter his trajectory to find the net. It's really quite remarkable.

I'm not sure Caufield is the type of player that can drive a line at the NHL level. His skating is a definitive weakness, and that 5-foot-7 frame of his doesn't stand up well in puck-battles. He's going to need a capable, play-driving centre to get him the puck. But in the right situation, Caufield has 40-goal potential.","Caufield is a goal scoring machine. He already has an NHL shot and NHL release. Somehow he managed to score over 70 goals total this season. At the world under-18's, he scored a whopping 14 goals in 7 games. Caufield reminds many scouts of Chicago Blackhawks breakout star Alex Debrincat. Both players are 5'7″, yet have a tremendous release. Caufield's biggest knock is his size and at times his skating. He has low top-end speed, yet he always finds a way to create space for himself to get off a quick shot. Caufield projects as a first-line scoring winger at the NHL level. He will need at least one year of seasoning before jumping into the NHL.","A very quick skater who possesses great acceleration and quick steps, he's able to make plays at top speed. His skating ability and the fact that he always keeps his feet moving makes him hard to pin down by opponents and he can sneak into open ice for passes. While he is small, he is speedy and possesses plenty of high-end hockey IQ and passing ability. He can hide in plain sight, making him able to strike quickly and dangerously. He knows where to position himself to receive passes and jump on rebounds. He reads the play well and thinks the game quickly. He has an incredibly dangerous shot that is not only precise, but powerful, with an incredible release and he can get a dangerous shot on net from anywhere in the offensive zone. His agility and nose for the net are reasons why this player could develop into an elite level scorer at the professional level, despite his small frame. Defensively, while he battles hard along the boards, he rarely comes out on top due to his lack of strength and size. He plays with loads of energy and always looks for a scoring chance when hitting the ice. While his skating, shooting and passing skills speak for themselves, he is hailed for his vision and hockey IQ and can escape pressure with ease."
2019,C,70.5,192,16,COL,,Alex Newhook,"Newhook was fantastic in the BCHL for the past two seasons, as one of the most dominant Jr. A players of the modern era. He's one of the most entertaining and dynamic players in the draft. His skating, hands and vision all get plus grades. He can push the pace with his speed. He's got quick-twitch feet at full speed, which allows him to jet by defenders, and great edge work to create space in tight areas. He's often asked to carry the puck up the ice, and he does so very well. Newhook makes plays at full speed, often blowing by defenders, while also being able to pull up and make a play at pace. I've seen him make some very creative passes where he hits a tight lane with little time or hitting a man on the tape while he's going 100 miles an hour. He's also very skilled, and often makes tough plays to lose a defender and create space. Newhook isn't just a skill guy, he competes well too, which combined with his great speed allows him to always be around the puck. I don't know if he'll be a true defensive center in the NHL due to his size and I wouldn't call him overly physical, but I like that he battles. The one knock on Newhook is, at the levels with higher pace than the BCHL such as the World Jr. A or Hlinka U18 camp where he was cut, he wasn't dominant; but he was great at the IIHF U18 tournament.

Victoria Grizzlies GM/coach Craig Didmon on Newhook: “He has great endurance, he doesn't tire and wears his opponents down. He can attack in a variety of ways. He has great speed, a great shot on the fly and sees the ice very well. He can play 200 feet.”","The thing about a lot of players who can burn defenders wide with explosive speed is that that speed can often work against them. They begin to rely on it and their instinct is to just turn on the jets whenever the puck hits their stick. For many players, that speed forces them wide into areas of the ice where offence is hard to come by. It was my biggest criticism of Devils draftee Michael McLeod. A skill only takes you as far as your know-how. You need to be able to use it. Newhook has that speed but his brilliance is that he seldom wastes it. He knows when to pull up and find the trailer. He knows when to cut under the defender and drive the net. And he knows when to slow things down. But when the opportunity is there to burn wide or use his release at top speed (which he does effortlessly), Newhook will take it. He's electric and fearless.",,"Newhook has high-end skills with skating that is probably just shy of elite. He can dance on the ice at times, using quick hand skills to beat defenders one-on-one while always knowing his next play. He gets shots off quickly and finds teammates well under pressure. Having averaged 1.92 points per game, he had the seventh-best season ever by a U18 player in the offense-happy BCHL. Newhook requires patience because he needs to get stronger and needs to be harder to play against in more physical, tightly checked games, but that skill is tantalizing.","There was some concern among the scouting community about Alex Newhook's slow start (all things being relative) to the season with Victoria, but he's since hit his groove and finished the season on an absolute tear with the Victoria Grizzlies in the BCHL. With a strong showing at the U18 (Newhook had a hat-trick against Belarus in a pre-tournament friendly match last weekend), Newhook could easily find a home in the top ten of most scouts' boards. 

Newhook, committed to Boston College for next season, is the complete offensive package. His skating is elite, as Newhook can swerve through or around entire defensive units with relative ease. The coordination between his hands and feet to add an element of creativity that not many centres possess — a defenceman can tie up Newhook's stick, but that hardly means he's out of the play. Newhook can work a mean mohawk with his skates to freeze defenceman and open up lanes, too. This play is a perfect example of those deft, subtle touches that make him such a productive offensive player. With a little development and seasoning at Boston College — a great program — Newhook can develop into a high-end second-line centre at the NHL level. If one can find that player around tenth overall, that's an excellent snag.","Sure, Victoria Grizzlies centre Alex Newhook started the season slowly, but he more than made up for it by the end, producing at almost a two points per game pace in spite of it. Just imagine if Newhook had started the season anywhere near as strongly as he'd finished it.

I've found that Newhook is one of the better skaters in this year's draft, owing to an explosive first two steps, high-end acceleration and a top-gear that's elite. Newhook's footwork, agility and heel-to-heel skating are high, high-end. He can skate circles around the opposition if he wants to. Literally.

I'm not sure that I envision No. 1 centre upside for Newhook at the NHL level, but I feel good about his ability to develop into a defensively responsible two-way centre in time. He's going to a great program with Boston College next season, where I suspect he'll play a full two years. From there — watch out!","Newhook is a well-rounded offensive player and one of the most underrated players in the draft. Part of this is due to the league Newhook plays in. The BCHL is a tier II junior league in Canada, well below the WHL level on the West Coast. Yet, many NHL players and strong prospects have come from this league, and it's a direct feeder to the NCAA. Newhook put up 102 points and scored at almost a 2 points per game pace. He also produced at every major international event for his age group this past season. Newhook projects as a high-end number 2 center at the NHL level. He is likely 2-3 years away from regular NHL duty.","An agile skater, Newhook accelerates quickly to gain separating speed and is able to dash past defenders. Strong skater at his level, but he will need to improve explosiveness and raw power. Offensively driven player, he handles the puck with finesse and excels when leading a rush. Manages game well in the offensive zone under pressure. Shows great hockey sense, but needs to work on his consistency to play motivated. A pass first player with above average vision, he has the tools to take advantage of the other team's mistakes. Sometimes can pass too often when the better play is to shoot. Not really strong on the dot. Weaker presence physically as well when challenged and seldom steps up to hard areas of the ice. Defensively, he lacks intensity and drive and doesn't appear engaged in the play in his own end. Keeps stick in puck lanes and will step in front of shots, but avoids getting into battles. Away from the puck in the defensive zone, he looks to break the zone, stretch the ice and transition quickly. There is still more work needed to play tighter in his own zone and use his feet to get him in position to use his body to take the man off the puck. Overall great hockey IQ, but he needs to bring the intensity up a notch more consistently to succeed at the next level."
2019,C,71.5,183,17,VGK,,Peyton Krebs,"Krebs was in a tough situation on a rebuilding Kootenay team this season, but he was everything that team could have hoped for. He was an all-situations center, a 17-year-old captain and a consistent offensive threat. Krebs has a giddy-up in his step, as he skates quite well, and has so much energy to his game. He's always on the move, be it winding up in his defensive zone or hunting down pucks. Some scouts feel his feet are high end. I see more just good, but I see the argument for his overall pace. Krebs is also a fantastic playmaker and one of the best passers in the draft. He's always looking to make a play and has some of the most creative plays I've seen this season. His seam pass completion rate is very high. Krebs is also a competitive defensive forward who can kill penalties and be trusted to do so in the pros. He has some push back in his game and isn't afraid to mix it up. Some scouts said he's a high-end skill guy. I haven't seen that; rather I see a skilled player who looks to use his teammates more than do it all himself. He's a play-driving center who can be used in any situation and that's very valuable.","Krebs is one of those kids whose production (1.06 points per game) and minus-50 rating raise questions with casual fans over his merits as a top-10 pick. But he's also a perfect example of what I talked about in my scouting guide regarding team-to-team variance in the CHL because Krebs played on a Kootenay team that, in its final season ahead of relocation to Winnipeg, finished 21st in the 22-team WHL and was outscored by 143 goals. Krebs, meanwhile, contributed on nearly 40 percent of his team's goals and paced to outscore his nearest teammate by 20 points over the course of a 68-game season. The WHL's 2016 first-overall pick, Krebs led all rookies in scoring in 2017-2018 and has been dominant in all three major international tournaments he has played in, combining for 21 points in 17 games at U17s, U18s and the Hlinka Gretzky Cup. Krebs can score with his quick, no-drawback, low-kick release in transition (he lacks a one-timer but that's fine in the grand scheme of things because of the way he gets open), makes plays at full speed (with an impressive top speed) and draws a lot of attention away from his linemates.",,"Krebs played on a bad Kootenay team this season but still managed to produce. A play-driving center who has been highly regarded for his character and leadership, Krebs does a lot of little detail things well and can adequately take care of his own zone. Krebs can really survey the ice with excellent vision and above-average distribution skills in finding his teammates. The hockey sense is a separating skill. Krebs unfortunately did just sustain a serious Achilles injury during training this summer, but he is expected to be available for the beginning of the season.","I'm sure that I'm not alone in my excitement at seeing Peyton Krebs play at the U18's for Team Canada. Trying to catch the signal of Krebs' game through the noise that was the Kootenay Ice has proven a difficult exercise at times. The team finished second-last in the WHL with a -143 goal differential, amid a season in which the long-rumoured move of the franchise was confirmed. These don't make for ideal playing circumstances. 

Still, Krebs carried on and put together a quietly excellent season. Though Krebs' raw offensive totals don't match up with his WHL counterparts in Dach and Cozens, it's worth noting that a playmaker like Krebs is going to suffer the ills of his environment more than a pure sniper or power forward. Krebs was making high-end passing plays on the regular that died on his teammates' sticks, or worse, they couldn't think the game at a high enough level to make themselves available in the first place. Even so, Krebs has a higher INV% (involvement percentage, meaning the percentage of his team's offence that he contributed to) of 41.3 percent, about ten percent higher than Dach or Cozens.

Scouts rave about Krebs' work ethic. It jumps off of the screen in every viewing. Playing with Kootenay, Krebs had 64 opportunities to quit last season, and he just kept going, at full-speed, fighting for every puck, getting in shooting lanes, playing at full-speed, no matter the score. The floor for this player is exceptionally high. Could make the jump to the NHL relatively soon as a result.","With all due respect to Peyton Krebs' teammates on the Kootenay Ice — they'll be the Winnipeg Ice next season — it's a testament to his character and resilience that he didn't come to hate the game of hockey by season's end. Krebs was playing chess on most shifts; his teammates were playing go-fish with their cards facing backwards. The Ice were easily the worst team in the CHL. It was tough to watch sometimes. Krebs would make high-end, creative passing plays that amounted to nothing almost every game. His teammates either lacked the wherewithal to jump into lanes, create space or finish chances. For someone like Krebs, who operates primarily as a playmaker, it's quite the handicap.

To Krebs' credit, he never quit. In spite of the mountain in front of him on a game-to-game basis, Krebs just kept on truckin'. Everything you've heard about Krebs work ethic is valid. He has the best motor in this draft. Krebs gives his all on a shift-to-shift basis, in all three zones, no matter the score or the circumstance.

When Krebs had the opportunity to play alongside some talented linemates at the U18s for Team Canada, he shined with ten points (tied with his linemate Alex Newhook for the team lead) in seven games, as the team's captain. Unfortunately for Krebs, he tore his Achilles in off-season training. It shouldn't impact his stock, but it just might. It's certainly something to monitor.","Krebs has managed to put up good offensive numbers in two years on very bad teams in the WHL. Krebs is considered to be a well-rounded offensive player. He averaged over a point a game with little-to-no support last season. Krebs uses his speed and instincts to create opportunities for himself and teammates. He also plays with a high compete level. Krebs may project more as a winger than a center at the NHL level, but regardless he is likely a top 6 offensive player at the NHL level. He is likely a season or two away.","Known as a cerebral player, Krebs is a world-class thinker and he oozes talent. Logging lots of ice time, he's constantly in the thick of the action. Although his skating still needs work, he's very shifty on his edges and has a quick and efficient stride that generates lots of power. He has beautiful vision and feathers passes into spaces that most players wouldn't see. He is equally adept with both his forehand and backhand and executes tape-to-tape passes with remarkable regularity. He has elite vision and his quick hands create lanes for himself. He's completely fearless carrying the puck in all three zones and challenging defenders with his aggressive stickhandling. While he doesn't play small, he can get roughed up a bit by bigger defenders. His shot has some pop, but he can still improve on his velocity to match his accuracy. His release is quick and smooth, making his shot deceptive and dangerous. He has excellent instincts and predicts the play effectively. Not only does he cause consistent turnovers, he is lightning quick at turning those mistakes into offence. He's a master at disrupting and regaining possession. His game speed and mental processing is a major strength. He provides significant back pressure and is an ideal supporter of play in his own zone, showing awareness and conscious efforts to be proactive and stay on the right side of the puck."
2019,D,75,193,18,DAL,,Thomas Harley,"Harley's development curve spiked this season. One of the youngest players in the draft, Harley progressed from a decent prospect to a 25-30 minutes a night defenseman with impressive tools for the Steelheads. When he was on the ice, his team had control of the puck. He's big, mobile, skilled and smart. That combination is attractive. Harley skates with the quickest forwards in the OHL due to the strength of his stride and his wingspan. He can jump up into the attack. He's good with the puck, showing some creativity and good vision, at times very good. Defensively he's a bit of a work in progress. His feet and stick allow him to make stops and close gaps, but he needs to bulk up a lot and be better at times in his own end. Harley makes a lot of plays but tends to get too cute and make costly turnovers. Some scouts argue that was just the byproduct of the massive and arguably excessive minutes he played.","In isolation, Harley's production this season (58 points in 68 games) put him in some pretty impressive under-18 OHL company over the last decade as its sixth-highest total behind names like Ryan Murphy, Ryan Merkley, Mitch Vande Sompel, Cam Dineen and Dougie Hamilton — and ahead of names like Mikhail Sergachev, Jakob Chychrun and Rasmus Sandin. Harley's offensive talent is obvious. He's really mobile for his size, light on his edges and his shot has to be respected (and has room to improve even more in terms of his delivery and follow-through) by opposing teams, which opens up his decent cross-ice vision as an option. But I have concerns about other areas of his game that have mitigated him from consideration in my top-24 tier. The biggest is his play in his own zone (though some of that was a byproduct of workload, the tough competition he was tasked with and the fact that he was playing nearly 30 minutes a night for stretches this season). Harley does a decent job defending the rush with his reach but he lacks physicality in puck battles and plays too passively within D-zone schemes, which can result in some ugly shifts. Still, Harley's August birthday, coupled with a strong follow-up performance at U18s after an excellent regular season bodes well for the growth that he needs to happen. Once he gets stronger, which could and should happen this summer, that will make a big difference.",,"A higher-end offensive defenseman with size and mobility, Harley has plenty of upside in his game. He uses his skating to let things open up offensively and has the poise to be patient enough to find the right play. Sometimes he can get caught a little deep, but usually picks his spots pretty well. He comes with just average defensive-zone play, but he has a decent stick and can close on forwards decently well. Some scouts have wondered about his defensive sense. I think he has the know-how, but just hasn't figured out the balance between offense and defense yet.","The term ‘effortless skater' gets thrown around a lot these days, but for Thomas Harley, it really is the best way to describe the way that he carves up the ice as a puck-carrier. His mechanics are excellent, with a deep knee-bend that gives Harley the ability to generate speed in an instant and maintain balance under pressure. This clip is an excellent example of just that.  Harley is one of the youngest defencemen in this class, with an August birthday, which, combined with his lofty point totals, augurs well for his NHL future. Those are significant factors that the pGPS system weighs in determining the likelihood of a player's success, and Harley's 64 percent XLS reflects that as one of the best in this year's crop of defencemen.","There are few prospects that were more difficult to get a read on this season than Mississauga Steelheads defenceman Thomas Harley. His consistency, from shift-to-shift and game-to-game, was all over the place. Every now and then, I'd leave a Harley viewing convinced I'd seen the second coming of Ottawa Senators defenceman Thomas Chabot; in other viewings, nothing more than a power play specialist with third-pair upside.

Perhaps the truth lies somewhere in the middle of those extremes?

Harley is an effortless skater that can read pressure and react quickly to carry the puck out of harm's way. He's fast, with a deep knee bend that allows him to reach his top speed in very few strides, and maintain balance when opposing defenders try to push him off of the puck.

 

If an NHL team can coach the mental mistakes out of Harley's game and get him to play hard on a shift-to-shift basis, he could develop into a competent, offensive defenceman with top-four upside.","Harley is one of the better offensive defensemen in the draft. Harley put up excellent numbers in the OHL this season and scouts believe his offensive ability is just beginning. Boasting a large frame, Harley uses his size to help him create space. Harley also possesses an excellent first pass and has decent hockey sense as well. Harley projects as a high end second pairing defender at the NHL level. He is likely 2-3 years away from the NHL level.","A strong skater, Harley lacks a fast top gear, but looks smooth transitioning and moving laterally. Has long, smooth strides with good agility and balance on his edges. Foot speed has improved from the beginning of the year, allowing him to accelerate quicker and stick with opposing forwards better off the rush. Has a good understanding of the defensive zone and shows good gap control and uses his stick to get in shooting lanes and prevent any second chance opportunities. Uses his reach effectively and is tough to beat across the blue line due to his good gap control. Displays quick decision making on the offensive blue line on the power play. A smart defender on the back end, he possesses good instincts and awareness of when to jump into the rush. Confident with the puck and makes a crisp initial breakout pass. Struggles at times to make a smart play under heavy pressure in his own zone, causing some bad turnovers. He is also more than capable of firing the puck and has an accurate wrist shot with a deceptive release that he utilizes well to freeze defenders who try and take away the shooting lanes. He can dish smart passes and uses the open ice well, dragging opponents out of position, making fake rush attempts and dishing passes all over the offensive zone moving the goalkeeper from side-to-side and exposing weaknesses."
2019,D,72,186,19,OTT,,Lassi Thomson,"Thomson had a great first WHL season, playing big minutes in all situations for Kelowna. There are a lot of positive attributes in his game. He has an absolute rocket from the point that can beat goalies clean, as well as generate opportunities around the net. He can move the puck very well with his brain and feet. His puck game is good, showing the ability to generate clean exists and entries, stretch the ice on breakouts, and showing confidence with the puck. He can at times make high-end plays with his poise and vison, but he also tends to be too cute with the puck and play without urgency, leading to costly turnovers. Defensively I don't mind his game, but his strength is more with the puck than without it. I think his offensive game is high-end enough to balance out any minor defensive issues. He's going back to Finland next season.","One of the oldest first-year draft-eligible players in the draft, alongside Lavoie, Thomson is an aggressive, heavy-shooting defenceman (note: heavy denotes the spin the shot creates, rather than velocity, making it tough for goalies to control the rebound) who can score in transition, offset plays to his one-timer, or through timely attacks to the slot or the backdoor play. Defensively, Thomson plays a physical, glued-to-you-off-the-rush brand that can be really effective at holding the neutral zone and forcing turnovers but can also occasionally get him exposed. Thomson is a bit too much of a one-trick pony as a shooter offensively but he can still move the puck well enough and if that skill can be groomed there's significant room for growth in how he's used.",,"Thomson is a good two-way defenseman who uses smarts over skill. His skating is good enough to get him up the ice and he's sturdy in his own zone, but there's not a lot in terms of overall puck skills or dynamicism. He is very decisive, making confident plays with the puck and allowing himself to get into space. There's not a lot of forcing it with him, and his offensive reads are pretty strong.",,"On a weak Kelowna Rockets team, Lassi Thomson did a damn good job playing big minutes and contributing at both ends of the ice. He's an excellent puck-carrier, capable of leading a breakout with his feet or a strong first pass. He's opportunistic offensively, willing to drive the puck deep into the offensive zone to create chances.

I like Thomson's chances of developing into a strong two-way defenceman who can contribute to both phases of special teams.",,"A fantastic skater with light feet and ease of movement, this Finn is an exceptional skater at the elite level. His skating ability makes it hard to catch him or check him and he can use his speed to his advantage to create lanes up the ice. He is shifty and unpredictable, which makes it easier for him to skate the puck out of his own zone. His high-end mobility makes it so he can make crisp passes but sometimes those high-risk plays come at a cost. He is creative with the puck and has a great slap shot, which may not only stun the goalie but create rebounds for his teammates. It's Thomson's play without the puck that concerns many, and it's safe to say his defensive play is a work in progress. As with many offensive defencemen, he takes some risks that he should avoid and at times when beaten, seems to lack the urgency needed to make it right. Needs improvement when defending one-on-one, but has the ability to take the puck coast-to-coast if he does create a turnover. He plays with an edge and can be relied on to jump in the play offensively. As mentioned, needs to work on his defensive play, but has the tools to take his game to the next level if he puts the effort in."
2019,D,71.75,178,20,WPG,,Ville Heinola,"Heinola trended up quickly from a fine prospect to an almost lock to be drafted high this season. He was called up to his club team where he played a significant role, as well as on the Finnish U20 team. His hockey sense drives his value. Heinola is a calm, poised puck-moving defenseman who generates clean exits and entries with his vision, and makes plays on the man advantage. He's fine defensively due to his positional play, despite not being the biggest defender. However, he has limitations that may hinder him as he progresses. His size is obvious but his skating is also a minor concern. His stride breaks down when he gets going in a straight line, which is worrisome in a 5-foot-11 defender. I like his edges a lot, with Heinola showing a powerful burst on his first few steps to balance out the stride issue somewhat.","Heinola's growth this year has been incredible. It really has. Every time I watched him play I came away more impressed than the last and that has made him one of the consistent risers on my list this season. And though he's a more complete player than Honka, I don't see the same offensive level at his ceiling. Heinola is who is he because he's efficient (by that I mean that he makes plays quickly, he doesn't hesitate, but he does both of those things while still having surveyed the ice ahead of the decision), he quickly earns the trust of his coaches, he's precise in his execution offensively and he's compact and careful defensively. But he doesn't take over games and he's not going to be a dynamic offensive threat at the next level (though he showed signs that there may be more flair below the surface in the Liiga playoffs). He's really, really good. I just don't think he's going to be an outright star. He's probably going to be picked in the mid-to-late first round, that's fine.",,"Having spent the entire season playing quality minutes in Finland's top pro league, Heinola is especially intriguing. I think his skating is only average for a player his size, which keeps him from ranking a bit higher. There are more sub-6-foot defensemen in the NHL, but you still need to be able to skate at a high level. However, he makes up for it in his hockey sense. Coaches won't have to worry about him too much because he's so poised and moves the puck with incredible efficiency, even though his offensive skills are not necessarily dynamic. He defends decently well, closing on opposing forwards quickly. The fact that Heinola's minutes only went up in the Liiga playoffs shows how highly valued he is at such a young age.","On paper, Ville Heinola profiles like a top-five pick. The Finnish defenceman spent his entire season in the Finnish Liiga, playing against men, and produced at a clip better than that of former third-overall pick and Dallas Stars defenceman Miro Heiskanen — though not as prolific as Anttoni Honka, who we'll get to in a minute. Heinola only has one historical comparable player, and based on their inputs, pGPS projects Heinola to score at a 46-point clip on a per season basis in the NHL. 

The difficulty I'm having — and it's quite common — is reconciling Heinola's production with how the player looks on film. Usually, someone who is this productive offensively as a first-time draft-eligible player in a men's league would possess high-end skating or a heavy shot — something that jumps off of the screen. That's not really the case with Heinola, though he's above average in most regards.","On paper, Ville Heinola profiles like a prolific, offensive dynamo of a defenceman. His scoring rate as a first-time draft-eligible player in the Finnish men's league is higher than that of fellow countrymen and rookie defensive phenom Miro Heiskanen — that good.

I'm not sure any part of Heinola's game suggests that offence at this rate is what we should project for him at the NHL level though. His shot is okay, nothing special, and I don't see a player that's an active contributor in the offensive zone.

I like Heinola's hockey sense, and it's easy to imagine a scenario where he develops into a second-pair defenceman. It will take some refinement on the part of the team that drafts him, but the possibility exists.","Finland has been cranking out strong prospects today, and Heinola is no exception. Heinola's biggest asset is his hockey sense and his ability to make a strong first pass. Heinola has very few flaws in his game. He does need to get stronger, but that will come with time. He projects as a top 4 defender with offensive upside. He is likely 2-3 years away from NHL ready.","A capable puck-moving defenseman, Heinola is poised under pressure and makes small but smart plays in his own end. Overall, his skating is good, even though he could stand to add a bit more speed. He's agile, has quick first-step acceleration and can shake off opponents with quick turns. He defends aggressively in the neutral zone, which can result in odd-man rushes for his team. He creates turnovers and is good at forcing the opposing team to try to cross the neutral zone again. His biggest weaknesses are on the defensive side of things. He gets caught out of position multiple times at even-strength and on the penalty kill. The fact that he gets outmuscled pretty easily doesn't necessarily help the situation. He's trusted to play on the penalty kill despite his mistakes, which tells you something about his coaching staff's faith in him. He carries the puck with confidence and is excellent at traversing his way through the neutral zone. He's shown an ability to play a deceptive offensive game. He's able to make quick, small plays when required, but also has poise with the puck. His passes are mostly accurate and crisp. His game needs refining and he doesn't necessarily have any standout tools, but he projects to be solid two-way defenseman with an offensive upside."
2019,RW,73,212,21,PIT,,Samuel Poulin,"Poulin, the 2017 second-overall pick in the QMJHL draft, was a good junior player the past two years and got better as the season went along and in the postseason. He's a smart and competitive winger. He's very intelligent, flashing high-end vision and tending to make good decisions with the puck. As the season went along he showed more consistent playmaking and overall dynamic elements. He's got some soft skill, but he's more of a distributor than an individual creator. He's got very good hands in tight and scored several nifty goals. His shot is also good, and he can score with his wrist shot in tight. Poulin works hard, is strong on pucks, and wins his fair share of battles along the boards and in front of the net. He's already quite strong, measuring in at over 200 pounds. His skating is OK. Some days he flashes a good top gear and other times I don't think his pace is anything noteworthy.","Poulin, taken second-overall in the 2017 QMJHL draft, has progressed well ever since without really taking huge leaps. Given the talent level that was already there, though, that has produced a darn good player. He's a lot to handle along the wall, is willing to go to the net with that power by dropping his shoulder and using one hand on his stick to force his way to the crease (or the slot) and has what has always been some sneaky-good passing skills that can surprise defenders who expect him to drive the net for a scoring chance, only to find the trailer. That versatility will translate well to the pro game. He also tracks the play back to stay above pucks and in responsible positions within Sherbrooke's structure, making him a positive presence in all three zones. Poulin was the best player on an otherwise mediocre team and played his best hockey late in the season (he finished the year on a seven-game point streak) and into the playoffs, where he posted eight goals and 14 points in 10 games. A good summer should make him one of the QMJHL's tougher players to contain next season.",,"Poulin has been one of the toughest players for me to rank. There are times when you see a player showing what he can do with his size and skill. There are other times when he disappears. The effort needs to be better. Aside from that, the skill he has in that sturdy frame of his is tantalizing. If he finds a level of consistency to force his will more during games, he has a chance to outperform his draft ranking in a major way.","You just get the sense watching Samuel Poulin that he's going to will himself to the NHL. His skill level is high-end, and Poulin possesses a great deal of creativity with the puck, sure, but his work ethic is off of the charts good. If there's a loose puck on the offensive zone; he's the first one there. If the defenceman is trying to execute a breakout; Poulin is going to make it as difficult as is humanly possible.

That skill, and work ethic project well at the next level for Poulin. So, too, does his skating. Poulin is an explosive skater with a strong first two strides and good top-end speed. As he gets more physically mature those traits are only going to improve.","There wasn't a lot of talent around Samuel Poulin in Sherbrooke, and all he did was produce at an elite level in the QMJHL. He's a creative offensive player with high-end offensive upside. He can put the puck in the back of the net and distribute it to his teammates with about the same amount of skill.

The major concern with Poulin's game is that he's not the fleetest of foot. Other than that, there aren't many holes in his game. It's easy to imagine a scenario where Poulin develops into an impactful middle-six player at the NHL.","Poulin is a strong, power forward type player who has seen his stock climb this season. Poulin's skating has improved as the season has progressed, and he has shown an ability to put up points and produce offensively. Poulin uses his size and strength to his advantage. He projects as a low-end 2nd-line winger. He is likely 2-3 years away from NHL duty.","A decent skater with an above-average top gear, Poulin has long strides but he has trouble accelerating in tight spaces. However, he can beat defenders wide once he's given open ice and has the speed to be considered a threat coming across the offensive blue line. His stops, first steps and turns in control of the puck are very aesthetic and quick. Knowing he's got speed and strength, he loves to dump the puck deep to recover it. He is very good at handling the puck with speed and is a complete power forward. He has a great control of the puck with one hand, which allows him to protect his puck very effectively. He's aggressive offensively and can lead the rush by carrying the puck into the offensive zone and set up possession. Never one to shy away from board battles, he will go to the corners and usually comes out with the puck. He is responsible defensively and puts in the necessary effort to stop plays down low. He's patient in his own zone and watches the play so he can be at the right position, at the right time to create turnovers. Also very active once his team regains possession of the puck, he makes himself an immediate option to complete the zone exit. His work ethic is elite and he's a tenacious, hardworking forward who doesn't take a shift off."
2019,D,72.25,193,22,LAK,,Tobias Bjornfoot,"Bjornfoot was a touted prospect for a few years and a minutes eater for Sweden's international teams, including being one of the best defensemen at the U18s and named the best defenseman in Sweden's J20 league. His skating provides a lot of his value. His ability to lead a rush, pinch off the blueline and close on his checks is very good. His feet allow him to make stops and transition pucks. He has solid defensive acumen and generally is trusted by coaches to play tougher minutes. His puck game is average. He can have the odd flash offensively due to his feet and above-average vision. His skill level doesn't overly impress, but there were times, particularly in the second half of the season, he showed more confidence making creative plays. He could be a reliable two-way defenseman in the NHL who might not put up points.",,,"Bjornfoot is one of the smarter players in this draft. His ability to read plays in all zones is exceptional, and he always puts himself in a good spot. Despite a relative lack of high-end skill, he's a good passer and has shown flashes of more offensive capabilities. Bjornfoot keeps it simple when he has to, allowing his vision and mobility to do the work for him. With elite defensive sense, he is so hard to play against in his own zone and limits mistakes when he has the puck. He can get it up ice quickly, too. It's clear when you talk to him that he is mature and carries himself like a professional. He's the kind of guy you want to have on your team.",,,,"An elegant skater, his puck-moving skills are a notch above other European prospects. His upper-body strength and balance make it very hard to knock him off the puck. Aided by his strong skating stride, he's great at moving the puck from zone-to-zone and his mobility allows him to fend off attackers as he uses both his stick and his body to protect the puck. A mobile two-way defenseman, he shows confidence playing in all three zones. He has a strong and hard first pass to start the transition game and he also has the ability to transport the puck zone-to-zone himself. If given the chance, he won't hesitate to carry the puck towards the slot in the offensive zone. With his quick lateral movement, he's able to patrol the blueline while looking for openings to either set up teammates or shoot the puck himself. His gap control and stick work are above average. He's generally good in his own zone, although he needs to work on his positioning around his own net. At times, he finds himself too far away from the puck, but not in a position to cover the slot either, which can lead to dangerous scoring chances for opponents. He's calm under pressure and rarely throws the puck away or makes a pass to a teammate in a dangerous position. He's mature in the way he plays and his progression has been very good this season."
2019,RW,72.75,193,23,NYI,,Simon Holmstrom,"Holmstrom's junior career has been bumpy to date due to multiple injuries the past two seasons, as he had hip surgery and tore a ligament in his thumb. When healthy, he's generally drawn praise from scouts, and he played well at the junior and international levels. Holmstrom is a very skilled and smart winger. He makes a lot of smart decisions and finds options consistently well. With HV71, Holmstrom was often used in their setups to make plays from behind the net, and he did so very well, finding players in high-percentage areas in a variety of ways. He has slippery skill, and while he won't often go end-to-end, he can get through defenders and have the odd impact shift with his skill. Holmstrom competes well. He's not overly physical, but he engages defenders well and will battle for space. His skating is fine. He can show the odd burst where he turns defenders, but his overall pace is average.",,,"Good size and hockey sense have helped Holmstrom lift his draft stock throughout the season, as has a particularly strong performance at the under-18 World Championship. He has a very good shot that he can get off from anywhere. The puck really zips off his stick. His puck skills are OK, and pretty average in terms of one-on-one stick skills, but he gets himself into good positions and helps create space for his linemates. Holmstrom has good physical strength which helps him protect the puck well, and he has a little power element to his game. But does he have enough skill to create on his own?",,,,"A speedy forward with a lot of skill and creativity that makes him stand out on the ice. Holmstrom is an excellent skater with good first steps. He has elite acceleration and top speed and he can handle the puck and stickhandle his way through traffic while maintaining high speed. He also uses his soft hands to stickhandle his way past defenders. He has a strong wrist shot and can score from up close and from far out. He can play the game at both a high pace and a slow pace, sees the ice well and can make great plays on the power play where he mostly works from behind the net. He's a constant threat for his opponents to handle as he likes to challenge defenders on the outside and simply outskate them to force himself around them and towards the net. He's not a player waiting for something to happen and always tries to generate offense for his team and can create scoring chances on his own. However, he sometimes makes risky plays by doing too much on his own. He is an excellent forechecker and often can win puck battles in the defensive zone, too. He uses his speed to chase defenders and win pucks when they are trying to set up. Overall, he's a very mobile player who likes to be involved in the game."
2019,C,71.75,183,24,NSH,,Philip Tomasino,"Tomasino is a very talented forward who started the season down the lineup but worked his way into a decent role on a top OHL team. He's got all the tools to succeed in the modern day NHL. He's a very fast skater with high-end puck skills and the vision to make difficult plays. His pace is good but I wish he used his high-end speed a bit more. Tomasino is a threat off the rush due to how quickly his feet and hands move, and when you think of “playing fast,” he's a guy who is built to do that. He looks to make plays, often finding tight lanes, and he has the creativity to make unique passes. Tomasino has a slight build and isn't the best at winning 1-on-1 battles in the tough areas. He can at times get pushed around and out of the game, and other times he'll drive the tough areas. He'll need to work on the consistency of his play and making the most of his tools, but he's got the ability to impact a shift like few in this class do.","Tomasino's game is built for today's NHL in that he plays with pace, he's a threat in transition, he handles the puck lightly but not too long, he drives the slot, he finds pockets off the puck and he makes tough plays look easy. A little more upper body strength will go a long way to making him a more complete player as well. Though Tomasino is a natural centre, he spent a good chunk of the post-trade deadline season playing right wing with Akil Thomas due to the IceDogs' overwhelming talent down the middle. Now that a decent chunk of the IceDogs core is poised to move on, Tomasino will become more of a go-to threat next year and I think he will handle it really well. The talent is there for him to become a productive, borderline line-driving top-nine forward at the next level.",,"Tomasino is an exciting player because of his elite-level skating ability. He looks like a gazelle on ice with his fluidness and quickness. With a quick release and solid vision, he's a true shot-pass threat in the offensive zone, too. Tomasino can play in a variety of situations and handles the flow of games very well. Whatever style a team needs him to play, he can probably do it. The important element, however, is the speed at which he plays the game. He's fast both up and down the ice, and quick in small areas. He has a good work ethic, a willingness to go to the hard areas of the ice and a competitiveness on the puck when he gets there.","Tomasino is the complete offensive package. His hands, feet, hockey sense — they're all good to above average traits, and they give him a higher ceiling than one might otherwise suspect from a 31st overall player. That said, Tomasino was playing on an offensively loadedteam in Niagara, and it seemed clear in my viewings that a not-insignificant portion of his production can be attributed to that.","The big question with Niagara IceDogs forward Philip Tomasino is how much of his production was a byproduct of playing with the likes of Jack Studnicka, Akil Thomas, Ivan Lodnia, Ben Jones, Jason Robertson, etc. on a loaded IceDogs team. Because his production is quite impressive in a vacuum.

It's worthwhile context, certainly, but I give Tomasino ample credit for what he was able to create offensively last season. He's a fearless puck-carrier, willing to pay the price to take the puck to the high-danger parts of the offensive zone. His hands are elite, and I think his hockey sense is above average, too.

I'm not sure that I project Tomasino as a centre at the NHL level, but he could develop into a high-end middle-six contributor on the wings.","Tomasino had one of the highest scoring rates at 5-on-5 of any draft eligible prospect. Tomasino also saw his game and offense improve as the season progressed. He plays an excellent overall game, and his shot stands out. Tomasino is at his best in open ice and uses his speed to creating scoring chances. Tomasino's biggest knock is his lack of strength, but this will likely come with physical maturity.","An offensively-gifted forward with no major weaknesses to his game, Tomasino shows elite vision and a dangerous ability to be a set-up man. His explosive skating style is highlighted by a lightning-quick first step and high-end foot speed. His elite acceleration allows him to be highly aggressive on the forecheck and force defenders to turn the puck over with his constant attacking. He's also able to utilize a quick step to transition the puck deep into the opponent's zone. He's adept at using his smarts and speed to blow past the defense to get possession of the puck in deep and get the offense set up for sustained pressure. There's no question about his offensive abilities. He shreds defensemen to pieces with his quickness and has the ability to release a solid wrist shot towards the net or deliver a crisp pass to an open teammate. He's able to make up for overextending himself on offense by using his speed to get back into the play on defense. Although he's shown inconsistent efforts on the backcheck, he displays good stick work and can pilfer pucks to turn defense into offense quickly. He tends to shy away from physical play which limits how well rounded his two-way game can be, but he'll improve when he adds more muscle to his frame. He'll also have more success if he adds more snarl to his game."
2019,C,71.75,182,25,WSH,,Connor McMichael,"McMichael had a great season, as a go-to player for London when its lineup was depleted, and he continued to produce and generate shots at a high level when the roster filled out, although he tailed off toward the end. He doesn't wow you with his tools, but he's a quality player. McMichael is a very smart all-around hockey player. He sees the ice very well, is creative with the puck and understands the game away from the puck. He's not the biggest guy but McMichael competes well. He gets to the net and gets back on defense. With the puck, he's skilled but not amazingly so. He can make some space with his hands, and his shot can surprise goalies with the ability to pick corners. His skating leaves some to be desired. He has decent speed but not great for his size, and his stride is inefficient. I give a nod to his sense and production as indicators that he could play in the NHL.","McMichael's playoff performance was disappointing by most measures. His play on the team's third line at even-strength didn't have enough of an impact to tilt games London's way when they needed him. Throughout, he was also used on the wing in spurts instead of at centre, which is a little odd given he was 55 percent on nearly 600 faceoffs in the regular season. McMichael is a player who does a lot of different things really well at the junior level but (outside of maybe his release) doesn't have any standout skill that really leaves you thinking “that will translate to the NHL.” As a result, he projects as a third-line forward more than a high-end scorer, even though his 36 goals ranked third among under-18 forwards this season to Kaliyev and 2020 prospect Cole Perfetti. He needs to get stronger if his development is going to take off.",,"One of the fastest players in the draft, McMichael carved out a substantial role for himself on a talented team and was one of the top draft-eligible producers in the OHL this season. His shot really improved this season with a good, quick release. He competes, too, playing with tenacity, and his ability to create on the rush is among his more important attributes. As he gets stronger, he's going to be difficult to handle down low.","Death, taxes, and the London Knights producing among the best two-way pivots at the draft like clockwork. Next in line for the seemingly endless succession of defense-first centres from the legendary OHL franchise is Connor McMichael, who was a consistent riser from puck-drop onward. 

Many believe that McMichael has upside beyond what he's shown thus far at the OHL level, and I tend to agree with that assessment. McMichael has excellent vision as a puck-carrier and always seems to find his linemates and get them the puck in position to score. He's not afraid to shoot the puck either as his estimated ten-plus shots per hour at 5-on-5 can attest.",,"McMichael is a well-rounded center that plays for the NHL factory London Knights in the OHL. McMichael's game isn't flashy, but it is consistent. He always finds a way to put up points and make his team better. McMichael has above-average hockey sense and is an excellent skater. He will likely have a big jump in offensive production next season. He is likely 2-3 years away.","Very skilled two-way forward with speed and vision who possess a fluid stride and can gain a high-end top speed in a hurry with the puck on his stick, carrying it through the neutral zone. Does an exceptional job of breaking up passes and plays in the neutral zone thanks to his positioning and active stick work. Transitions quickly from defense to offense with ease, often faster than his opponents can react and can beat defenders in tight while protecting the puck for dangerous scoring opportunities in close. Seems to process the game exceptionally well compared to his peers and consistently shows that he can turn the most simple of plays into quality scoring opportunities. Anticipates the play well and always seems to know where to be on the ice. Possesses a solid shot, and the smarts to be an excellent playmaker and has the ability to create dangerous scoring opportunities. On the backcheck, he uses good positioning and a quick stick to break up plays and generally clog up the neutral zone. He's very aggressive in his own end and unforgiving in his effort to pressure the puck carrier to make a mistake. Isn't afraid to use his solid size to separate the puck carrier and the puck, but only when necessary. Constantly smart when it comes to the 200-foot game and makes good choices with or without the puck."
2019,LW,69.25,165,26,CGY,,Jakob Pelletier,"Pelletier had a great second season in the QMJHL and was among the top scorers in the league. Despite his massive point total (39 goals-89 points in 65 games), Pelletier is not a natural scorer. He's a fine skater but doesn't have an explosive stride. His stride breaks down at times, but I've seen him pull away from players at times too. He's skilled but won't dangle defenders or go end to end. Rather he's a very smart and very competitive forward. Pelletier shows great vision as a playmaker and makes tough plays in small areas. If you ever can't find Pelletier on the ice, look around the opponent's slot or net and you'll likely spot him. He lives in the tough areas of the ice and competes very well for pucks despite not being that big. He scores by going to the tough areas but has a sneaky good shot, too. You don't have 39 goals by accident. He also kills penalties quite well. There are legit concerns about a player his size without great speed or hands projecting to the NHL, but he could make it based on his compete level, character and sense.","Pelletier isn't all that dissimilar to Puistola in that he lacks the versatility required to project lower in an NHL lineup so you're basically banking on his talent to continue to blossom and carry him into an offensive role. The good news is that I think there's a real chance that happens for him. He definitely has the creativity and on many nights this season, he looked like the best player on the ice for Moncton (a team that boasted standout 20-year-old Jeremy McKenna, who may get drafted this year, as well as Minnesota Wild third-round pick Alexander Khovanov). Pelletier finished second to Alexis Lafreniere in under-18 QMJHL scoring a year after he finished second to Lafreniere in under-17 scoring. Late in the first round, I'd bet on a higher-risk player with real offensive potential than a safer NHL option with limited upside, which is what picking Pelletier comes down to. I love his creativity (he rarely makes the play you expect him to make and the one he does is normally the better, smarter play in retrospect anyway).",,"Pelletier has quick, shifty skills that have served him well in one-on-one situations and getting pucks into the zone. His skating is fine, but perhaps not overly dynamic for a player of his size (5-foot-9). But he makes up for that with his energetic, fearless style of play. His game needs work away from the puck, as there are some concerns he's a tad too one-dimensional.","Whatever Jakob Pelletier lacks in size — he's a mere 5-foot-9 — he more than makes up for with high-end offensive creativity with the puck and elusiveness as a skater. Pelletier has dominated the QMJHL offensively since entering the league last season, culminating in 89 points through 65 games this year with the Moncton Wildcats. 

Where there is concern with Pelletier is with the fact that he isn't an overly fast skater, which can often spell doom for slight forwards as they rise the ranks of professional hockey. If Pelletier can't improve upon his footwork, the possibility exists that all this offensive upside will be for naught.

The reason to believe Pelletier can overcome this is that he's determined as all hell. His work ethic has never been in question, nor has his willingness to fight for the difficult parts of the ice to produce offence. If he sorts this out, he'll be a dynamic offensive player at the next level.","While Jakob Pelletier might not be the biggest skater on the ice at a modest 5-foot-9, his competitiveness is near the top of the charts. More importantly, though, Pelletier is a highly skilled offensive player, with good vision, a high-end shot and creativity with the puck on his stick. The big concern among scouts with Pelletier's game is that he's not the greatest skater. He gets around the ice decently well, but not at the speed one would like to see from a player with his physical disadvantages.

If Pelletier can get his skating to an above average level, though, he has legitimate top-six upside and could contribute on an NHL power play. If you can score like Jakob Pelletier, it's worth the risk to see if he can improve that skating, too.","Pelletier is another small skilled forward in this year's draft. Pelletier's biggest asset is his hockey sense. Pelletier uses his speed and high-end skill to produce and set up scoring chances. He also has a deceptive shot. If taller, Pelletier would likely be ranked higher. Pelletier has top 6 winger potential and is likely 2-3 years away.","A speedy and agile skater, Pelletier has an explosive stride and can fly at top speed. Dangerous when using that pace at both ends of the ice, the puck seems to be on a string as he propels forward. Offensively, he is very opportunistic and if he smells a scoring chance, he seems to have an extra gear and killer instinct. While he would be thrown into the finesse player category, he plays a pretty simple north-south game. Creative and shifty, he can turn nothing plays into scoring chances on a regular basis, but his biggest strength might be his way to process the game with his high hockey IQ. Natural scorer with a quick release and accurate shot. His shot is probably the most underrated part of his game and he could even take more advantage of his accurate and surprising release. His slickness allows him to get away with his small frame for now, but he needs to grow physically to reach his potential. Learning to play more responsible in his own zone by realizing how to better use his skating and puck skill, he'll develop the ability to intercept pucks and counter quickly. Works hard alongside the boards to take the puck out of the zone and ensures good communication with teammates so everyone have their assignment covered. Overall, he's a well-rounded player with very few weaknesses outside of his measurements."
2019,LW,75.5,195,27,TBL,,Nolan Foote,"Foote, the son of longtime NHLer Adam Foote and younger brother of Tampa first-round pick Cal Foote, was successful in the WHL the past three seasons and was one of the leading shot generators this past season. Nolan Foote is a trigger man for a power play, with a heavy shot that can finish plays. He has good vision and overall hockey sense, but the key to his game is his ability and willingness to shoot the puck. He's a big man who competes well for pucks. Given his shooting skill, he might have taken too many outside chances when he could have driven the net, but he can attack when he wants to. My concern with Foote is whether he can create enough of his own chances at the pro level. His feet are below-average and, while he has puck skills, I never really saw him create space consistently with his skill.","Foote uses his weight and his balance to receive passes on his backhand and pivot to his forehand for a one-motion release as well as anyone and that's a skill that makes him lethal in any league because it's a split second movement across his body that disguises his release point and forces goalies to catch up to him. And though that skill is absolutely transferable, there are hitches in Foote's game which haven't yet disappeared (something that is particularly concerning given his three years in the WHL due to his age). I worry, too, given the way his brother Cal has struggled to increase his foot speed as he has gotten heavier, that Foote will have to settle for average acceleration, something that could limit him from becoming the power forward so many believed he could be.",,"Foote had a pretty strong season, scoring 36 goals, even though he played much of it with a fractured wrist. He is a good, not great, skater who uses his body well and can win along the boards. His puck skills are average, but he has exceptional hockey sense and can make good passes in all zones, and whether or not there's pressure. Foote also has enough edge in his game to win a lot of battles down low.",,,,"Playing a prototypical power forward style of game, Foote has an imposing frame with great athleticism, which is evident in his work ethic at both ends of the ice. He's powerful on the puck and when he asserts himself he's an unstoppable bull on the wall or in a straight line to the net. Possessing strong bloodlines, he has far more offensive prowess and puck skill than his father Adam and brother Cal and has the potential to become a dominant power forward due to his tenaciousness on the attack. His skating lacks fluidity at times and, according to scouts, it will be a large hurdle for him to overcome before he finds success at the NHL level. He does have the ability to use his footwork to make himself quick and agile as he pivots and crosses to find free ice. The way he shoots the puck is lethal as everything from his release to his velocity and pin-point accuracy should give him the ability to wreak havoc on goalies for years to come. He's able to combine that velocity and accuracy with a deceptive release that seems to flummox opposing goaltenders. He works hard to crowd puck carriers and compete for ice in his own zone. While his defensive work is average, he has the ability and strength to separate his man from the puck with a big hit along the boards."
2019,C,72.75,180,28,CAR,,Ryan Suzuki,"Suzuki, the younger brother of Montreal prospect Nick Suzuki, has been a top playmaker in the OHL since being drafted first-overall in 2017. His vision is outstanding, with the ability to wait out lanes and hit passes through seams at a very high rate. He's skilled with flashes of plus hands, and he can navigate in tight spaces. He doesn't have as good a shot as his brother, but he's a better skater with a bit of a separation gear to gain the zone and create space for his playmaking. Ryan Suzuki's criticism among scouts is his lack of physicality, especially as a smaller/slighter forward. However, he will get to the middle of the ice to make a play. I like how he defends due to how smart he is, and he can kill penalties at the amateur level. Some will look at his production this season (25 goals-75 points in 65 games) and not be wowed, but he didn't play on a good team. It's fair to say he hasn't been as dominant as he could be with his talent level, but he's a good player and projects to be a top-six center.","There was a time, not that long ago, when Suzuki projected as a top-10 pick in this class. Given that the Colts selected him first overall in the OHL draft, that shouldn't surprise anyone. Suzuki hasn't quite reached take-over-a-game levels though. Part of that is driven by the fact that he's a playmaker first and the Colts didn't have anyone for him to play with this season after they traded Lucas Chiodo to the 67's (the injury he dealt with at U18s didn't help him showcase his talent after an excellent Hlinka Gretzky Cup showing either) but part of it is a matter of over-handling and trying to do too much to create the perfect play. Still, Suzuki was far-and-away the best player on a bad team and the 25-point gap between him and the nearest Colts forward (who also happened to be the coach's son and 21 years old) speaks to that. Suzuki is a pinpoint passer who uses delays and a surprisingly-effective toe drag to pull defenders in before finding a teammate (something that will be harder to do at the NHL level unless he learns to take those chances a little less often).",,"One of the better playmakers in the draft, Suzuki has seen his stock dip a little over the course of the season, even though he didn't necessarily do anything wrong. Some prospects just passed him. One of the primary complaints among scouts is a relative lack of intensity and compete level, and there are some issues with consistency that arose when he wasn't getting to the middle of the ice enough. He's a cerebral player who could afford to make quicker decisions, but there's very little questioning his puck skills and his ability to find teammates. He has elite vision and anticipates exceptionally well. As Suzuki gets stronger and does a better job of getting to the middle, his value is only going to climb.","Ryan Suzuki, the younger brother of Montreal Canadiens prospect Nick Suzuki, didn't quite live up to the expectations that came with his first overall selection in the OHL Entry Draft, and often left analysts wanting, but there is a significant difference between being disappointing and bad. In this case, Suzuki disappointed, but he's still an excellent prospect in his own right. That distinction is an important one. 

The name of the game for Suzuki is his vision. Much like his older brother, Suzuki sees the ice exceptionally well, and is tactical in the way he diagnoses a team's defence and attacks its open spaces, with or without the puck. He's an excellent passer who never fails to find his teammates with the puck, often in great scoring opportunities.

What's made some sour (everything is relative, remember this) a bit on Suzuki has been his tendency to let the game come to him. At times, Suzuki can seem passive, particularly without the puck. This is especially noticeable in the defensive zone, where Suzuki's effort comes and goes depending on the day.","Did anyone in this year's draft have a bigger fall from grace than Barrie Colts centre Ryan Suzuki? When the year started, he was a consensus top-ten pick, considered the premier playmaker in this draft. A week out from the Draft, it wouldn't surprise me if he slides out of the first round entirely.

It won't be Suzuki's talent that costs him draft spots. He's still one of the Draft's foremost playmaking centres, with elite vision and offensive instincts. If someone can tap into the raw potential present in Suzuki's game, the potential for a grand slam is still there.

This season, though, Suzuki's competitiveness was decidedly absent. He played almost exclusively on the perimeter. Worst of all, Suzuki had a nasty habit of letting the game come to him.

At this point, Suzuki looks like the ultimate boom-or-bust forward prospect in this Draft. With risk like that, I had a hard time keeping him in my first round. Ultimately, there was too much talent there to drop him any lower than 25th.","Suzuki was considered by many to be a top 10 talent before the beginning of the year. Even though he did put up solid offensive numbers, scouts were expecting significantly more from him. Suzuki projects as a number 2 playmaking center, similar to his brother Nick, a Montreal Canadiens' prospect. Suzuki is likely 2-3 years away from NHL duty.","A cerebral player, Suzuki always seems to show patience and the uncanny ability to make the right play. He is a smooth skater, with good balance on his edges and good foot speed to accelerate quickly in tight spaces. He has very good offensive awareness, both in terms of moving his feet to open up passing lanes to teammates and at finding soft areas where he has time to get a shot on net. Despite not possessing the biggest frame, he shows elite puck-handling abilities. He has a quick release and accurate wrist shot, but he often gives up scoring chances in favour of a pass. He needs to learn to engage a killer instinct. When he turned it on, he was one of the most difficult players in the OHL to contain this past season. His shot is really underrated as he has a fast release and it has excellent velocity. He's also very deadly with the man advantage as he can set up beautiful one-time chances. He needs to work on limiting turnovers and when he does cough up the puck to skate harder on backcheck and not just glide back into his zone. His smart positioning and active feet extend to the defensive zone where he supports the puck well. Looks like he could be an elite playmaker at the next level and an underrated goal scorer."
2019,LW,72.5,170,29,ANA,,Brayden Tracey,"Tracey played his first full season in the WHL after playing Midget AAA as a 16-year-old. He was one of the best rookies in the league, working his way into a major offensive role on Moose Jaw's top line and eventually Canada's top power play at the U18s. Tracey is the kind of player who you want with the puck. He's a creative offensive player with high-end, offensive hockey sense. He's always looking to make a play, controls the puck well and sees his options very well. Sometimes he tries to do too much and can force pucks where the option isn't available, but I like that he tries things. He's got a lean body and can struggle versus bigger players, but he goes to the net, scoring a lot of goals this season around the tough areas. Tracey's skating for me is so-so with a stride that lacks power and breaks down. He has enough speed to skate with pros but not challenge them. Some scouts like it and think, when his lanky frame fills out, he'll be fine; but for me, he lacks that extra gear.",,,"The WHL's Rookie of the Year and one of the fastest risers in this draft class, Tracey has really good puck skills and vision, with an ability to make plays under pressure. His skating is probably closer to average, but I don't view it as a hindrance. He gets to the hard areas well enough and can make some decent plays on the rush.",,,,"Continuously elevating his game, Tracey may not be an elite skater but he is quick on his edges. He has the ability to improve his speed and footwork as he possesses the raw talent to improve. While his skating needs work, he does possess the ability to make quick turns and transitions. He has a quick shot and seems to recognize when passing lanes open and he appears to play with patience when he has the puck. With that said, he sometimes tries to get too creative which often results in him losing the puck on his stick when under duress. While he plays with poise and patience, he could use more urgency in his game when it's necessary. Without the puck, Tracey could use improvement and needs to learn to better use his body on the backcheck. Sometimes making the wrong body check at the wrong time, Tracey needs to learn to read the defensive play better. What he lacks in physicality, he makes up in making quick decisions and can be an opportunistic playmaker. Overall, he is a raw talent with room for improvement, but he definitely has a high ceiling if he can realize his potential. Relied on for power-play minutes, he is someone who can take responsibility in all three zones of the ice once his game is better rounded."
2019,C,75.25,212,30,BOS,,John Beecher,"Beecher entered the NTDP as a physical beast and was ready to win battles versus USHL players as a 16-year-old. His production this season was similar to the previous one, albeit with little to no power play time this time around. There are very few 6-foot-3 centers who can skate like Beecher. He regularly turned defenders around with his surprising speed, and with his reach/ability to protect pucks, he generated so many chances with his skating. Beecher is big, strong and plays hard. He competes hard for pucks, is physical and makes his presence known on the ice. Offensively he has some question marks in the industry about whether he'll score in the NHL. I don't mind his puck game. His hands are very average, but I've seen him pull off the odd move around a defender. I think he's got enough vision to make plays in the NHL. He finds his options, whether a defender at the line or option near the slot to move the puck to. I don't see a power play guy, but I could see him become a decent top-nine center with penalty kill duties.",,,"An exceptional athlete, Beecher has high-end speed. He's one of the best-graded skaters in this draft, even at his size (6-foot-3). Beecher would be a no-doubt first-rounder if he had a little bit more in the puck-skills department, and his offensive sense is average at best. It's not shocking he didn't put up big numbers at the national team development program, as he was the No. 3 center for much of the season, but Beecher gets behind, around and through defenses very well with his wheels. I just don't know if he's going to be much of a big-time producer at the next level, but I'm also not averse to taking swings on athletes of Beecher's caliber.",,,,"Dynamic center who can skate, shoot and pass, he is good at reading the ice and recognizing where his teammates are in all three zones. He creates space for them by using his size and puck protection and then often sets them up with a nice passes. He utilizes an up-tempo, speed-blazing, north-south skating style. Fast while playing to his size, he uses his speed to beat opponents to the puck. When he has the puck, he protects it well. Shows the ability to handle the puck at high speed and likes to set up shop in front of the opposing goalie and put rebounds into the back of the net. Strong on the puck and attacks the dirty areas as a puck carrier. Has good size to command space throughout the rink and isn't afraid to make a hit to regain possession and always finishes his checks. He's also surprisingly light on his feet and can get around the ice with good speed and some finesse as well. Uses his stick to poke check pucks effectively and create turnovers defensively. Puts in the effort in his own end and throws his weight around. Hard to knock off his skates in board battles. Already a 200-foot player, his upside is endless and he plays with determination, grit and energy. Already a handful for opposing players and will only get better as he matures."
2019,D,72,170,31,BUF,,Ryan Johnson,"Johnson was a name touted in the prospect world for a few years. He didn't put up amazing boxcar numbers, but he was a solid two-way defenseman for Sioux Falls who tilted the ice when he was on and was a rock at the World Jr. A Challenge for Team USA. What immediately stands out is his skating. He's an effortless skater who can evade checks and generate clean zone exits with his feet. He's not a blazing fast skater, but his edges and first step are high end. Johnson has a good skill level but that part of his game didn't stand out as much as his feet. Some scouts think his puck game is great, but I've seen him just good in that regard. He sees the ice very well, and while he can make a big play, he also has a tendency to turn too many pucks over and at times be careless with his decisions. I don't see him as a true point producer in the NHL. Defensively he's not the biggest guy, but he's so solid due to his smarts and mobility. His gap control is very good and often closes on guys quicker than they anticipate. Truth be told, he's a player I've never been blown away by, but he's a player who every scout and USHL source I know pushed very hard, so this ranking may undervalue him a bit.",,,"Johnson is one of the best skating defensemen in this entire class. He's an exceptional defender who performed at his best in big games this season. But he is a pretty raw talent when it comes to ability to make plays in the offensive zone, which is why he's a little further down the board. In faster-paced games, he focuses a lot more on defending, and I don't know that he has the offensive sense to make effective plays up ice. Still, the feet and defensive sense are so strong that he might be the most intriguing second-round-graded player on my board, and I wouldn't pick on a team that grabs him earlier.","Underestimate Ryan Johnson at your own peril. The point totals don't scream first round, but it's clear as day upon watching Johnson that it's precisely where he belongs. Even if Johnson's offensive upside is limited (which is up for debate), the modern NHL is replete with defensive defencemen that carved out lengthy, successful careers by tilting the ice whenever they stepped onto the ice. That's the type of player Johnson projects to be at the next level.

What I appreciate about Johnson's defensive game is that it's predicated on preventing clean zone entries, good puck retrievals and his team possessing the puck. The opposition is entering the offensive zone with control of the puck on just 30 percent of their attempts when they target Johnson, and his team is controlling more than 56 percent of the shot attempts when he's on the ice. A play like this one is a perfect example of why that's the case. Johnson denies the USNTDP an entry, and before they've recovered the puck is on his teammate's stick, and they're on the attack. One of the scouts I spoke to about Johnson suggested that upside remains a concern with Johnson, and it's worth noting. Perhaps Johnson tops out as a fourth defenceman. Even so, if you can find that player late in the first round, you take it. I also think that Johnson's offensive capabilities will show themselves as he plays with better players around him in the NCAA, where he's committed to the University of Minnesota next season.","While the role of the defensive defenceman is getting smaller with each passing year, there are still a few elite, defensively sound blueliners in the NHL that find a way to contribute without offering an awful lot on the traditional score sheet. Sioux Falls Stampede defenceman Ryan Johnson has the potential to be one of those players.

Johnson is a great skater, who can generate speed with ease and is nimble on his edges. He's an elusive puck-carrier, capable of executing a breakout from the defensive zone with ease. Despite playing huge minutes for the Stampede, against top competition, Johnson escaped the sample of games I tracked with a 61 percent share of shot attempts and a 60 percent ratio of scoring chance control.",,"A smooth skater with high-end skills, Johnson plays a simple game and is calm when he has the puck in and among pressure. Due to his skating ability, he's a great option to carry the puck up the ice. His positioning is good, his transition game is above average and he plays strong on his skates. Showing awesome aggressiveness in front of his own net, he ties up bodies and the sticks of opponents well. He plays with an active stick in the defensive zone and defends the blue line well by standing up opponents. Due to his strong positioning, he often forces opponents to dump in the puck instead of letting them have a controlled zone entry. He always seems to make the right play out of his own zone and shows a great ability to find the smart pass on outlets due to his high hockey IQ. Relentless along the board in battles, he shows good instincts and awareness at both end of the ice and in the neutral zone. He jumps in on the rush when he sees an opportunity to do so. He's calm, cool and collected in deep and tough down low on the power play. He has a good shot and doesn't need much room to fire it on net. He's also able to let his wrist shot go even with defenders draped on top of him."
2019,C,74,195,32,OTT,,Shane Pinto,"Pinto played his first season of high-level hockey as an 18-year-old, and was a top player in the USHL between Lincoln and Tri-City. He's a big, strong center with good hockey sense. He makes plays and is tough to deal with in the hard areas. His compete level isn't consistent, but most nights he's on and tough for opponents to deal with. There will be stretches where you question Pinto's skill level. He looks average with the puck, makes basic plays and doesn't show the ability to create. Then all of a sudden he puts a puck through a defender and generates a chance. I'm skeptical of calling him a natural offensive player and a power play guy in the NHL, but I could see him become a bottom-six forward with his skill. His skating ranged between average to above-average. He won't blaze by guys and doesn't hit the blueline with speed, which is a concern, but he'll be able to skate with pros without the puck.","I was slow to trust Pinto's skill set this season but he just kept looking better with each viewing and his play with the Storm post-trade was electric in spurts and peaked at the right time, with points in 10 of his final 11 regular season games before opening the playoffs with eight points in the Storm's three-game sweep of Des Moines in the first round of the Clark Cup playoffs. Pinto, who went from a 330th overall pick in the 21st round of the USHL draft to one of its all-rookie team members, does an excellent job staying ahead of the play without cheating (which takes a fine balance) and releasing from defenders to get open for a give-and-go play. He also tracks pucks at an extremely high level, which enables him to take efficient routes and control possession when he's on the ice. Pinto doesn't need time or space to finish off plays either. He's decisive with the puck and often knows where he wants to put it before he even receives it. Some players can just anticipate the play one or two steps ahead of others and Pinto is one of them.",,"A big forward with a good shot, Pinto had an exceptional season in the USHL. There's nothing terribly flashy about his game and his puck skills are no better than adequate, but he skates well and has some grit in his game. Versatility is probably his greatest asset. The lack of dynamic skill suggests he could play a middle-six role down the road if he hits his ceiling.",,,,"A skilled sniper who plays a power game, Pinto has slick hands and he loves to use his flashy dekes to maneuver past opposing defenseman.  He uses his size well and keeps positioning in offensive zone on 50/50 battles. He plays like a bull in a china shop. He's willing to go to the front of the net in the offensive zone and not afraid to go into battle with opponents to extend plays. He also owns a precise wrist shot and his excellent hand-eye coordination enables him to tip lots of shots fired from the point on net. Is able to release his heavy shot quickly when he gets in the right position. Lazy on draws, he's not much for taking faceoffs or the ensuing battle for the puck once it's dropped. He lacks a bit of intensity in all three zones as he watches the play develop before getting involved. He rarely gets involved in board battles in the neutral or defensive zones and doesn't make any effort to recover the puck when he loses it. Although he has some above average defensive skills and he's great in man-to-man coverage, he often looks to be out of position in his own zone. Scouts have some concerns about his intensity level and would like to see him get involved in the play on a more consistent basis."
2019,RW,74,194,33,LAK,,Arthur Kaliyev,"Kaliyev lit up the OHL this season, as one of the few modern-day OHL players to score 50 goals as a 17-year-old. He's one of the best goal-scorers in the CHL and often had more than 10 shot attempts in a game. He's not going to go bar down that often, but his shot is an absolute rocket, and if goalies are not in position, they won't have time to adjust once he lets it go. Kaliyev is also a very good playmaker who makes high-end plays. Those 50 goals were complemented with 50 assists. Due to his shot and vision, he's an absolute weapon on the man advantage who can run a unit and pick apart defenses.  He's skilled but Kaliyev isn't a player who can go end-to-end. He skates OK, but the main criticism of his game is his pace and compete. Kaliyev can often look like he's not going that hard and will have long stretches of indifference. With that said, even in the many games where he looks like he's doing nothing, you'll check the box score and see one goal and two points. Thus the question is whether his style of play will translate to the NHL pace. He's one of the most divisive prospects in this year's draft.","Here's the full list of under-18 CHL forwards who've scored 50 goals in the last decade: Jeff Skinner, Alex DeBrincat, Arthur Kaliyev. Nobody in the QMJHL (though Nik Ehlers came close with 49 goals in 2014) or the WHL has done it. It's been a long time since Patrick Marleau did it in 1997, or even since Sidney Crosby did it in 2004. That's some kind of company. Skinner went seventh overall and posted 63 points as a rookie with the Carolina Hurricanes the following season. DeBrincat fell to 39th overall due, returned to junior and eventually emerged with a 52-point rookie season of his own. Now he's a 40-goal scorer in the NHL and the teams that passed on him regret it. Though Kaliyev's skill set places him as the least talented of those three players, concerns about his skating and spotty defensive play shouldn't be enough to push him much lower than the late teens in this draft. His one-timer will make him a threat at any level and he's not a one-trick pony, either (I actually really liked the way he opened up his game as a passer this season, something I was worried he wouldn't be able to do after watching him as a rookie). He's going to prove some doubters wrong. The late birthday (June 26, 2001) doesn't hurt either",,"There have been only 13 players in OHL history who scored 51 or more goals in or prior to their under-18 season. With 51 goals and 102 points for a Hamilton squad that essentially was in rebuilding mode after winning the OHL championship in 2018, Kaliyev is one of the best scorers in the draft. He shoots off the pass better than anyone, his shot is both heavy and accurate and he does a great job of getting to the goal-scoring areas. On top of that, he has the size (6-foot-2) and strength to get those tough goals at the net-front. His passing is overshadowed by the shot, but he also had 51 assists this season and can make a lot of plays. There are a few concerns with Kaliyev, though. He lacks breakaway speed, though he's probably a little more agile than given credit for. And there are complaints about his consistency of effort. Some of that is going to come with maturity, but it is a red flag. Even still, he can find the back of the net better than almost anyone else in this draft, and there's always going to be a premium on that.",Shoot-first winger who knows how to find the back of the net. Somewhat one-dimensional but that dimension is spectacular. Changes the release point and angle to exploit netminders. Protects the puck well. Engagement is an issue. As are his first few strides. There's a potential boom here with a hint of bust sprinkled in.,,,"A solid skater with good stride power, Kaliyev boasts an accurate and elite shot and has the instincts of a natural goal scorer. He has average foot speed that holds him back in puck races. Although he won't wow anyone with explosiveness, he is well balanced on his feet and has a solid top speed when he gets going. Dangerous with the puck on his stick, he uses his frame to protect the puck well and possesses a nose for the net. Shows better vision and patience on the cycle and finding open teammates across the zone. Plays a power forward game when he's engaged, finishing his hits and using his size to open up space in the soft areas of the offensive end. Has a very quick release on his shot with great accuracy, making him a threat to score off the rush or use a defender as a screen for his wrist shot. He gets into open space really well in the offensive zone which helps his teammates feed him the puck. Scouts have reservations about his work ethic and his play in his own end. His compete level is low as he is the last to forecheck, backcheck and get involved in any kind of physical battle. That being said, he has a good reach on the backcheck and will help support his defenders low in the zone when necessary."
2019,RW,68.25,165,34,PHI,,Bobby Brink,"Brink was the best player in the USHL this season and a driving force for whatever line he was on. Brink is an interesting player in that he doesn't look the part of a top prospect. He's listed at 5-foot-8, he skates awkward, and he doesn't look all that smooth and coordinated. His hockey sense is just fantastic, though. He's an elite passer with the patience, anticipation and overall vision to make unique passes seem routine. I've seen him hover around the zone, waiting out options as defenses scramble to figure out what play he's going to make. Brink has very impressive hands and a good shot, too, but what will get him to the pros is his ability to make plays. He competes and even killed penalties at the junior level. What may hold him back is his skating. He moves with a weird stutter in his stride, and his feet flail. His top speed is fine due in part to his size, and he's got good power on his edges to allow him to maneuver around the ice. But he lacks any kind of explosiveness you want in a player that size.","Speaking of overstated concerns about skating! Believe in Bobby Brink, people. Allow yourself to believe in him. The astronomical numbers he put up in the USHL this year were his own doing and once he adds a little more strength the foot speed will catch up to the skill level that made him the USHL's Forward of the Year. Brink will take a little longer than some of the other top prospects in this draft to get to his ceiling but that ceiling is exciting. Centres are more often the driving forces on their lines at the next level but Brink's ability to win back pucks with his stick, get open and break teams down tactically once he has it is a joy to watch. There's a risk in everyone outside the top-12 in this year's draft but the reward on a player like Brink is a dynamic puck-handling winger who can involve his teammates when the player is there or do it himself when they are not. Sometimes you have to swing for the fences. I'd take that chance on Brink, who also has a late birthday (July 8, 2001).",,"Elite vision and offensive sense make Brink an especially intriguing player. He also comes with a high-end release on his shot and can get it off from just about anywhere, including off the pass. The big strikes against Brink are his size and his footspeed. He does a nice job of getting himself in good positions to create and can manage the offensive zone pretty well, but I'd have concern about his ability to keep pace if his skating does not improve. Even with that in mind, Brink's offensive toolkit is special. He sees the ice as well as anybody in this class and makes confident plays with the puck, letting the game come to him and not trying to do too much. Only Thomas Vanek had a better scoring rate among full-time USHLers as an under-18 player over the past 20 years.","A deadly offensive player with quick hands, great awareness, and a nose for finishing plays. Tore the USHL apart this season while adding a standout performance at the World Junior A Championships. His skating needs more work. The mechanics are off but it hasn't hindered his ability to produce… yet. A Denver commit. ",,,"A competitive and skilled offensive forward, he's very active and involved in all three zones. He has a very fluid skating stride, great speed and excellent agility. His great acceleration and strong edges allow him to take off in a hurry, with or without the puck. Displaying great intensity, he does a fantastic job of always pushing the pace and keeping the pressure on, making opposing players really have to work to defend against him. While he reads the ice well and sees plays developing quickly, he will often sacrifice his defensive positioning to create a rush. Crafty with the puck, he always has his head up and uses his teammates well offensively. While in transition and at full speed, he's still able to show off lightning-quick hands and very good passing abilities. He's not afraid to try no-look and behind-the-back passes, making him even harder to defend. Has an impressive ability to receive and unload one-timers, but he doesn't get a lot of power behind his shot. Due to the fact he keeps his feet moving through body checks, he's able to draw penalties because of it. He has solid awareness and hockey sense, although he does look a little lost in his own zone at times. His small size is obviously a factor against him, but he does everything that small players need to do to be successful at the professional level."
2019,D,76.5,193,35,DET,,Antti Tuomisto,"Tuomisto came on strong this season after not looking like much of a prospect last season and was one of the best defensemen in Finland's junior circuit. Tuomisto can move the puck and be relied on at both ends. He kills plays with his stick and reads closing gaps. He's physical and makes it tough for opposing forwards to get inside. With the puck, he shows decent creativity and can execute passes through tight seams. I wouldn't call his puck game natural, though, as he's not going to deke through anyone at the pro level. His skating/pace is the main concern. His stride is OK; it can look clunky at times, particularly on his first few steps, but when he gets going in a straight line he has OK speed. He's not one to push the tempo, though, and he doesn't show much pace in his game.",,,"Tuomisto is a towering defenseman with raw talent but also some notable holes in his game, particularly short-distance quickness. He struggles in faster-paced games.",,,,"Big and strong on skates, Tuomisto is a huge defenseman with big potential. He displays powerful strides and is hard to knock off the puck. He also possesses good mobility and speed for a big guy like him. He needs to learn to use his size better in front of the net and in the corners, but overall he's already an effective player in the defensive zone. He's able to limit space for opposing players in the defensive zone due to solid gap control. He sometimes overcommits on hits, which result in him being out of position. He's a strong presence on the ice and reads the game well. He's able to find open lanes and handles the puck extremely well. He's doesn't try to do too much with the puck as he keeps things simple. He actively wants the puck and is great with seeing open ice and giving outlet passes to his teammates. Often looking for an active first pass, he's great at reading open ice and sees potential breakout passing lanes well. One of the better young passing defenseman in the game, he makes crisp tape-to-tape passes with outstanding accuracy and power. He possesses a powerful shoot from the point as well and is effective as a power-play quarterback. When he adds more muscle to his frame and improves his skating, his overall game will improve."
2019,G,75.25,180,36,CAR,,Pyotr Kochetkov,,,,"A third-year eligible goaltender, Kochetkov really turned heads at the recent World Juniors. He was named the best goaltender in the tournament after posting a .953 save percentage as Russia won bronze. He was just traded from HK Sochi to SKA St. Petersburg, which may give some teams pause -- SKA is the top club in Russia. But he has the size teams want and showcases tremendous athleticism and an unrelenting competitiveness between the pipes that allow him to stay with plays. He should be the second goaltender off the board.",,,,
2019,G,79.5,199,37,OTT,,Mads Sogaard,,,,"A mountain in net, the big Dane has great mobility and athleticism packed into his size. He has some good poise and solid hockey sense, but the jury is still out on how he handles higher-pressure situations. There's so much upside here, though.",,,,"A large goalie with a massive presence in the net, Sogaard doesn't only rely on his size or frame to make a save. He is surprisingly quick with his feet and moves well in his net. He showcases agility in how he positions himself and an ability to quickly get into his butterfly and shuffle around to reposition himself to stay square. He has a massive lower half spread and his upper body covers a huge portion of the upper net and he is also highly athletic. He is very calm and controlled when moving laterally and never overcommits. One of his weaknesses is the ability to track pucks through screens and traffic and he needs to work on picking up the shot location. He is hesitant to play the puck and seemingly doesn't like to get involved in play outside of his crease. He suffocates pucks consistently to his mid frame and redirects well low and to his blocker side, making life easy for himself to recover to get in front of second attempts. He has a dangerously effective glove hand and tracks clean pucks well to avoid fumbling the rebounds. When tasked with low and hard shots, he uses his stick as a strong tool to control pucks. He limits a lot of second opportunities and is surprisingly acrobatic, even if he does appear lanky and awkward at times."
2019,C,76,199,38,EDM,,Raphael Lavoie,"Lavoie's a talented player who had a good season but didn't play as well as expected before tearing it up in the QMJHL playoffs. The pure tools scream first-round pick. He's 6-foot-4, skates well for a big man and has a high skill level. There are times when you see him come down the wing, power his way to the net or make a skilled play to create a chance and you think that translates to an NHL scorer. He flashes high-end puck skills but it hasn't been consistent. He's got a hard shot and scored quite a few goals this season from long distance. As a late 2000 birth date on a good QMJHL team, his production (32 goals-73 points in 62 games) was mediocre for a projected top talent. This reflects a consistency problem in his game at times, as well as the fact that scouts aren't the biggest fans of his decision-making. I've seen good vision from him, and thus give him a 55 on his sense, but it's with hesitation as I've seen many instances where he throws pucks away or forces plays that aren't there He has some physicality, he defends fine and his coach this season trusted him with PK responsibilities. He has a ton of potential and ended his season with several exclamation marks.","I spent most of this draft year admittedly sour on Lavoie's game. He's one of the oldest players in the draft, he's one of the biggest players in the draft, he has the talent needed to be an unstoppable force at the junior level and yet that just never materialized … until the QMJHL playoffs. Lavoie threw the Mooseheads over his shoulders and dragged them into their final against the Rouyn-Noranda Huskies by racking up a QMJHL-leading 17 goals and 27 points through 17 games in the first three rounds. His nearest Halifax teammate, Ducks second-round pick Antoine Morand, had 12 fewer points during that 17-game stretch. That's insane. The biggest challenge with Lavoie is differentiating between how much of it is skill and how much of it is a combination of the fact that he's nearly a year older than some of the other players on this list (he'll be 19 during his first NHL training camp) and boasts an overwhelming physical dominance. Increasingly, though, his skill has begun to shine through. He gets to the net at will and he has the ability to finish plays in tight by pounding home rebounds or using some impressive stick handling to beat goalies with a deke.",,"Fluctuating draft stock has been the norm for Lavoie this season, but I think he did himself a lot of favors with his postseason performance. With 20 goals in 23 games for Halifax on the way to the QMJHL finals, Lavoie showed a good mix of skill and power. He's a big kid who moves well and can outmuscle opponents. There's room for him to fill out and become a better power forward down the line. Lavoie plays with some edge, and competes, but I think there were times this season when he didn't dominate the way many scouts believed he could. He still had a lot of success, but there is room for improvement. What I've seen over these past two years is pretty impressive from Lavoie. He keeps getting better.","Powerful forward boasts a deadly release that's as heavy as it is accurate.  Protects the puck well and forces his way into dangerous areas. Just 10 days shy of being eligible for the 2018 crop. Gets around well for his size, but quicker acceleration is needed.",,,"A complete power forward with great speed, he can always keep up with other top-end skaters. His speed allows him to create smooth zone entries, although while he has a quick stride, it's not overly powerful. He has a great shot with a quick release, but it doesn't always hit the net. With great stickhandling and ease, he is able to create scoring chances for his teammates. He has great strength and can protect his puck at all costs using his body and positioning when entering the zone. His hockey IQ allows him to find loose pucks around the crease and cash in on them. He's excellent on the forecheck with his strength and long reach, often keeping the puck in the offensive zone. He backchecks with intensity. He always looks if a player is alone in the slot and will cover him when needed. He is defensively sound and won't hurt his team with bad assignment coverage or turnovers in the neutral zone. He's conscious, intelligent and relentless before he gets the puck. He wins most of his puck battles and is always ready for a breakout pass. His ability to get back into the play rarely leaves him out of position. He needs to work on his body language when things aren't going his way and his overall confidence, but has loads of skills to build upon."
2019,D,73.75,187,39,ANA,,Jackson Lacombe,"Lacombe's stock picked up steam as the season went along as he had a so-so Hlinka followed by an excellent prep season at Shattuck before ending his year in the USHL. Lacombe is a mobile defenseman with a clean stride that generates speed quickly. He's able to hover around the blueline with his mobility and lead a rush well. Lacombe has a good skill level. He can evade checks and weave through defenders on rushes fine. He shows poise with the puck and rarely looks like he's exerting a lot of effort with his skating or puck-moving. Defensively he's got a bit of an edge and closes on guys well with his skating. While he makes some plays and plays the game hard, I question how well he thinks the game some shifts. He can be turnover prone and out of position defensively.",,,"LaCombe is a project, but an exciting one since he has decent size and skates exceptionally well. He's only been a defenseman for two seasons and still has plenty to learn, but he has intriguing skill.",,,,"A skilled, puck-moving offensive defenseman, LaCombe is a smooth skater and has a very fluid stride. He doesn't have the most explosive first few steps, but he accelerates quickly and reaches a decent top speed. He has slick edges and great agility that makes him quite deceptive in possession of the puck. Defensively, he needs to work on his gap control as he gives way too much time and space to his opponents to take quality shots off the rush. He has half-decent backwards skating agility, but he will need to work on his speed to match the attacker's quickness once he fixes his gap control. He gets the job done in board battles, but could still add to his frame to make the transition to higher level more seamless. He loves to move the puck up the ice using his quick feet and great vision to help find skating lanes. He tries to get involved in every offensive play and take the role of a fourth forward. He has great offensive instincts and he jumps into the play when he sees an opportunity. He follows closely every rush and often jumps in as the odd man. He has a quick, effective release and decent wrist shot accuracy. He distributes the puck well on the cycle and jumps right into the role of a quarterback on the power play setting up his teammates for slap shots."
2019,LW,71,185,40,VAN,,Nils Hoglander,"Hoglander had a quality first season in the SHL as a top-nine forward for Rogle who showed his high-skill game can translate versus men. Hoglander has the best hands in the draft. When he has the puck on his stick, he's trying to make a skilled play. His puck handling is lightning quick and he often leaves defenders in a knot with how he dangles while in stride. He's not a selfish dangler, though, as he's a great passer and looks for his teammates constantly. He's not a typical playmaker you see run a power play and hang around the half-wall hitting seam passes. He's always in motion and makes creative feeds. Hoglander isn't the biggest forward at 5-foot-9, but he plays with a lot of energy and engages well. He's got a bit of an edge to his game, too. He's a decent skater, more elusive than a burner with very good edges, but he can turn a corner when he needs to. I wish he had more of a dangerous top gear because versus men he got eliminated along walls quite often on zone entries.","Even as Hoglander's impressive early-season SHL production faded late in the year, I rarely left a viewing of him disappointed in how he looked. Hoglander, despite his size disadvantage, has already played 94 games of professional hockey, accumulating 22 points along the way. His skills are obvious when you watch him. He's got a bit of a shuffle to his stride but his feet are light and that allows him to propel around the ice and accelerates out of his turns. He's got excellent stop-and-start puck control, which he uses to spin off checks or when coming out of puck battles. And most of all, considering he's 5-foot-9, he always goes to the middle of the ice.

That's true without the puck in the way he jumps to the inside lane to get open for redirects.

And it's true when he has the puck and he willingly attacks bigger players and stays on the puck when he loses it. Hoglander isn't going to be a star at the next level but he projects as a productive, high-tempo, come-at-you-in-waves winger.",,"Hoglander has good quickness and competes for pucks, but lacks the size necessary to win a lot of those battles. He is quite good at evading pressure and extending plays with quick feet and even better hands. It's always a little harder to gauge players like him given the strength of the competition they face in the professional ranks, but Hoglander made an awful lot of plays. The skills I've seen over the past two years should translate to him being a quality prospect.",A skilled winger with good acceleration and a better release. Plays bigger than his size and has looked capable in the SHL this season. Quick cuts and quicker hands allow him to dart in and out of traffic.,,,"A quick, flashy offensive-minded forward, Hoglander likes to carry the puck in the neutral and offensive zones. Because of his speed and mobility, he is hard to defend. He is lightning quick and can dance through opposing defencemen with quick, darting movements with or without the puck. A very good passer in the offensive zone, he reads the game well and can make quick plays to drive the pace of the play up on the power play. His playmaking abilities stand out as he finds his teammates with hard and accurate passes, both from short and long range. His vision is excellent and his decision-making with the puck is impressive. Despite his small size, he likes to drive to the net and can get past defenders by stickhandling or outskating them. A smart player that thinks the game well, he sees openings before he receives the puck. He can struggle along the boards due to his size and lack of upper body strength and isn't as competitive in the defensive zone as he is in the other two zones or when he has the puck. Improvement is especially needed on the defensive side of the puck where he seems to shy away from blocking shots and doesn't always play sound positionally. At times he looks listless in his own end, but overall he competes hard despite a smaller stature. He needs to continue rounding out his game."
2018,D,74.75,185.32,1,BUF,,Rasmus Dahlin,"Dahlin is one of the best defense prospects of the modern era as a first-year draft eligible player. He looks special on the ice, whether it was logging top-four minutes in the Swedish Hockey League, being a power play man for Sweden's national team or being the top defenseman at the world juniors, all at the age of 17. His skill and IQ rank among the very best in the class. He can play at such a quick pace and make highly creative plays versus pros which at his age is unusual. What stands out to me is not his elite skill but his elite awareness. He understands how to attack defenses so well and attempts things I don't see players his age try. He sees gaps in coverage before they develop, makes great feeds, knows how to angle guys out and when to go for a risky play. He also has a low panic threshold and doesn't tend to force plays. He's a very good skater who, while not exceptionally fast, has good speed and is very agile for a player his size. His decisions aren't perfect at the highest of levels, but given his age and position, one can afford to give him a few mulligans. His offense is what will get him picked at the top of the class, but he is quite good defensively, as he battles hard, is physical and plays a quiet position game. While defense projections are riskier than forwards, he has the potential to be a franchise defenseman.","A couple of weeks ago, I broke down what makes Dahlin so unique. The truth is, what sets him apart is the unknown. Dahlin's combination of lateral quickness, ability as a goal-scoring threat and skating create a player who is dynamic enough to potentially become the league's best offensive defenceman. In a league where true No. 1 defencemen are at more of a premium than they've perhaps ever been, Dahlin has that kind of raw upside — and then some. In a country that has produced a good percentage of the NHL's best defenders, Dahlin has shattered records. He is one of the most gifted defencemen to enter the draft in decades and a transformational talent that could make him a perennial Norris Trophy contender.",,"There isn't a lot left to say about Dahlin at this point. For the past two years, he has seemingly had a lock on the No. 1 spot and just continues getting better. The Buffalo Sabres won't need to overthink things at No. 1, since Dahlin is the cornerstone defenseman the team desperately needs. There are plenty of other needs, and viewing Dahlin as a savior is probably not the best idea at this point -- especially after Jack Eichel came in with similar hype -- but there's no doubt Buffalo will be instantly better the second he throws the blue jersey over his head.

Dahlin is viewed in similar context as Connor McDavid and Auston Matthews as a generational talent, particularly on the blue line. I've been saying he's the best defensive prospect in a decade, but some scouts think it's even longer than that. To be that young and play a top-four role, averaging more than 19 minutes per game on one of the top teams in the Swedish Hockey League, is pretty rare. Additionally, Dahlin established an SHL record for points by an under-18 player at any position with 20 in 42 games.

In terms of hockey sense, skating and puck-handling abilities, Dahlin grades out as an exceptional player. His one weakness might be his shot, and he absolutely could get tougher in the defensive zone, which he readily admits is something he needs to continue to work on. That said, he already does a lot at an NHL level at just 17 years old.","We haven't seen a draft-eligible defender with this level of upside since Drew Doughty. Dahlin's ceiling is even higher. Effortless skating mixed with size, smarts, and dangles that would make Pavel Datsyuk nod in approval. He's the entire package and has all the tools to become a game-changing pillar for an organization. Buffalo is rightly excited.","Dahlin is a smart two-way defenseman who can play in any situation. He is a terrific skater and stick handler who can rush the puck, or join the attack in a hurry. Impressive agility makes him a good one-on-one defender. He has fine passing ability, and although not a big-time bomber, he has an accurate shot from the point. Not one to shy away from the physical game, Dahlin is an accomplished open-ice hitter. A young player, he must learn when to make the simpler play. Adding more weight should help him in board battles and around the crease.",,"A dominant rearguard,
he's got powerful strides.
He's shown that he can
move around very smoothly
in all directions, which allows
him to buy time at the blue
line. He's able to move laterally,
escaping the puck-chasers and
opening up passing lanes. An
always noticeable player, he
brings an incredible presence
to both ends of the rink. He
has tremendous vision, an
outstanding understanding
of the game. He can supply
an extremely offensive game.
He joins rushes whenever he
can and he can carry the puck
up ice with great speed and
immense confidence. With
his pace, he is able to shed
opponents in the neutral zone
with just two or three strides. If
he opts to pass instead of rush,
he's capable of unleashing long
and accurate outlet passes. It's
like he sees lanes before he
even gets possession of the
puck. Whenever he's on the
ice, his team is likely to receive
an odd-man-rush opportunity.
He never appears to be under
pressure and he makes the
right decision, thanks to his
heads-up approach. Physically,
he plays really solidly, closing
gaps with sound physical play
and winning lots of board
battles. No opponent sneaks
by him. His defensive game,
overall, and his positioning are
greatly improved. Occasionally,
he'll jump out of position to
pursue a possible attack, but
he's very reliable. Impossible to
beat one-on-one"
2018,RW,74,192.27,2,CAR,,Andrei Svechnikov,"Svechnikov, the younger brother of Detroit's first-round pick Evgeni Svechnikov, has been highly touted for many years in this draft class and tore up the OHL this past season. He's an offensive dynamo on the wing, showing an ability to create scoring chances in many ways with one NHL scout coining him a “five-tool prospect” — a term borrowed from baseball to describe that he's very good at everything with no glaring weakness. He's a good skater and very quick for a player with a pro frame. He often surprises opposing players with how quickly he can close on them due to his speed and reach, forcing a ton of turnovers. He's a very powerful player due to his speed and size, he gets to the net as well as anyone in the draft and can be a handful for defenders to deal with when he's barreling down the wing. When he's not bulldozing his way through defenders, he can make high skilled plays off the rush and is a very creative playmaker. He's one of the better passers in this draft class who can make tough dishes with consistency and looks for his teammates. Svechnikov has also been one of the more dangerous goal scorers in major junior and can finish chances from afar. He's been a solid penalty killer in Barrie and a shorthanded threat.","There has been a serious debate in some scouting circles about who the second-best player in the 2018 class is. As good as Filip Zadina is, I don't subscribe to that belief. Not only can Svechnikov score in more ways than any other player in this draft, but he also plays one of, if not the most powerful game of the bunch. The mastery of Svechnikov's game is that he doesn't beat teams by breaking down players one-on-one. Instead, he thrives off of the puck, makes plays quickly when he does have it and just plainly gets open. And when he gets the puck with time or space, he can score with his feet, his hands, and most of all his shot. Wrister low blocker, backhand shelf, one-timer high glove from distance, snapshot five hole. It doesn't matter. He'll pick his spot and he'll score.

He's also a threat attacking off the wall and the rush because he's so adept at handling the puck out wide and making plays at full speed. He was the best pure scorer in the OHL as a rookie, and did the same in the USHL a year earlier. Had he played Aaron Luchuk's 68 games, Svechnikov's 62-goal pace would have been 12 more than any other play in the OHL. He should step in and be a contributing top-six forward in the NHL next year.",,"An elite goal scorer and powerful skater, Svechnikov has a chance to jump right into the NHL and contribute. With 40 goals in just 44 games with Barrie this season, Svechnikov's 0.91 goals per game is not terribly far off from the pace of McDavid (0.94) and Steven Stamkos (0.95) in their draft-eligible seasons in the OHL. In fact, looking at the past decade of U-18 goal-scoring rates in the OHL, Svechnikov had one of the best seasons over that span.

Svechnikov can score his goals a variety of ways. He has the power and strength to get to the front of the net, as well as the elite shot to beat goalies from any distance. He's also exceptional when it comes to shooting off the pass. Much of his success offensively comes from his legs, with an ability to beat defenders wide, exploit teams in transition and drive to the net.

One potential point of concern is what will happen when Svechnikov's power game is no longer the decisive advantage that it is at the junior level. That said, he has high-level instincts in the offensive zone, and his hand skills are above average. He always seems to find himself in good positions, but he can make quick decisions under pressure and find a way to get his shot off. Additionally, he's adequate away from the puck, can get engaged physically and has a solid work ethic on the ice. Most years, he's an easy No. 1 overall pick, but there just so happens to be a freak of nature born the same year.","Physically ready for the NHL, Svechnikov blends world-class finishing ability with hard-nosed and defensively responsible play. A goal scorer who can impact the game in all situations. A terrific blend of speed, power, and precision. He'll be a front-line threat for years to come.",,,"A dynamic multi-tool
threat, he has the wheels
and the demeanour to
dictate pace on the ice. An
excellent skater who can turn
on a dime, who can cut in
and out of traffic. Deceptive
edgework, too. He owns a
powerful. NHL-calibre shot with
a deadly release. But he can
also pick apart the opposition
with his elite passing game.
With a tremendous touch and
world-class stickhandling,
he is able to undress hapless
defenders. Not afraid to lower
his shoulder and muscle his
way to the net. On top of
which, he has good defensive
instincts and abilities, which
he uses to counter-attack with
vigour. One-on-one, he's a nifty
as you would expect. Lots of
strength, but a light touch with
the puck. Even under heavy
pressure, he stays under control
in possession. Creative to the
point that he's been known
to try to score lacrosse-style
goals. Some scouts, however,
expect him to be even more
dominant. Others would like
to see him use his teammates
more frequently. His physical
game is a work in progress, but
he can punish unsuspecting
opponents. He also has a
knack for getting under their
skin. Defensively, he can
competently add to coverage.
Aggressive in his own zone and
eager stymie the opposition.
He's a full-package scoring
winger and, quite possibly,
ready to step into the NHL as
quickly as next season."
2018,C,74.25,181.46,3,MON,,Jesperi Kotkaniemi,"Kotkaniemi has been a top-six forward for his league team in Finland all season and had a very solid U18 season relative to his historical peers in that league. He was also very good during international competition, albeit being a late cut from Finland's World Junior Championship team. He played center for Finland and was a winger for his pro team, but he projects as a center. Kotkaniemi has a lot of desirable elements. He has very good hands that are high-end, if not flashing elite. He can make very skilled plays off an entry, but what impresses me is how well he can control the puck and keep plays alive. With his frame and skill, it's very hard to strip him of possession. He is also a very smart playmaker. Kotkaniemi sees the ice very well and can be the primary guy to set up along the wall on a power play and move the puck around. He understands how to create chances and isn't afraid to attempt difficult plays. He prefers to make plays, but when he does shoot, I've liked his finishing touch. His skating isn't amazing, but when I've seen him, his speed looks fine but his stride is a bit awkward. Defensively he'll need to improve, like every young player, but I think he's reasonably fine in that area and has shown he can be relied on at evens as a 17-year-old versus men. He has the best shot of any prospect in this draft class to be a No. 1 center.","Kotkaniemi is a big kid who somehow still manages to play an elusive game. It helps that he's a July birthday and still has a lot of room to grow, but even without it he managed to make himself into a reliable, consistent contributor in a pro league as a 17-year-old. He tailed off in the playoffs, but his 29 points in 57 games was the seventh-most productive season for an under-18 player in the history of Liiga, besting names like Jesse Puljujarvi (fourth overall), Teuvo Teravainen (18th overall), Mikko Rantanen (10th overall) and Kasperi Kapanen (22nd overall). He makes quick, smart decisions with the puck and intelligently keeps his feet moving and finds open ice to get it back. He also does a nice job getting underneath defencemen to open up the cycle. His game will translate well to the NHL and he has already proven he can be trusted enough defensively to play centre at the pro level. I think in time he could become a star. He has begun to make a name for himself, but I'm still higher on him than most.",,,"Great puck skills, vision and processing skills, but skating still a work in progress. Offers a clunky stride that doesn't generate a ton of top-end power. That didn't stop him from putting up more than respectableLiiga numbers though, albeit from the wing. A strong Five Nations and U18 tournaments while playing the middle of the ice should convince scouts that's where he belongs long term. May not be flashy, but gets the job done. Appears to have the highest upside of the centres in this crop.","A smart forward with a dangerous shot, Kotkaniemi possesses a high hockey IQ and determination with the skills to back it up. Positions himself well and often seems to be a step ahead of plays. Stickhandling and creativity allow him to split professional defences as a teenager. Decent size and frame, yet a very capable skater. ",,"A rangy forward, he's
got the reputation as
a player who can get
things done. Not an elite
skater, but he still manages to
threaten offensively. A bulky
forward with strong puck skill,
hockey sense, and quickness,
he's deadly inside the hash
marks as a setup man and
as a goal scorer. He can see
open puck lanes, creating
havoc for the opposition's
coverage. Even though he's
not flashy, he's hard on pucks.
And when he ramps up his
intensity, he can overwhelm
defenders with his size and
smarts to become an offensive
catalyst. He has a heavy shot
and even if his release isn't
quick, he's not afraid to pull
the trigger. His passing ability
is strong. Handling the puck,
he can make plays in traffic or
drive hard to the net. Good
positioning when he's in
attack mode, a challenge for
opponents trying to control
him. Not blessed with speed,
he works hard to make a
difference in the defensive
zone, putting his body on the
line, laying hits, getting his stick
on pucks. Two-way game is
much improved. Heady enough
to make the small plays that
can make a difference in
his own end. An intriguing
prospect with power-forward
upside and great hockey sense
– which draws comparisons
to Aleksander Barkov – but
only if he continues to develop
his skating stride, which is
awkward."
2018,LW,75,191.25,4,OTT,,Brady Tkachuk,"Tkachuk has had a very good season between college and the world juniors, continuing a trend of being one of the most important players on whatever team he's on. He was a possession beast for Boston University and towards the end of the season became one of the team's better playmakers. He has one of the best physical games in the draft. He's a strong 6-foot-3 forward who wins battles and bulldozes his way to the net as well as any teenager I've seen in the college ranks. Any scout I talk to will immediately heap praise on his competitiveness and the edge in his game. His skill isn't dynamic, but he has good hands, a good wrist shot and makes smart plays with the puck. He's a very smart player, can distribute the puck well and doesn't make many poor decisions. I saw the occasional high-end flash of vision from him, but he does make quick decisions and plays at a pro pace. His skating is solid, as well. I've seen him turn the corner on defenders numerous times, but he's never going to wow you with his speed. Coaches will love him because he plays well in any situation or role.","One of the oldest players in the class, Tkachuk was one day shy of ending up in the 2017 draft. As a result, you'd expect him to be several months ahead of a lot of the players in this class. In terms of his physical tools, he is. Tkachuk has always played above his age. While many of his teammates played in under-17s last year, he captained the under-18 team and posted a point per game. While Wahlstrom and co. played in U18s this year, he was a standout at the world juniors and in college. He doesn't have the high-end upside of the three forwards ahead of him, but he brings a physicality and mean spirit that all, but Svechnikov lack. He's an overpowering presence whose strong stride allows him to attack in waves and get to the front of the net to finish off plays. He's also an underrated passer and while I don't suspect he'll become the primary scoring threat on a first line in the NHL, I can absolutely envision him playing on one and making an impact. He'll be a good fit with a lot of different kinds of players.",,"""He's just a junkyard dog,"" as Team USA world juniors coach Bob Motzko said while Tkachuk starred at the tournament. That remains my favorite description of Tkachuk. Taking all of the qualities of his physical play and combining that with his elite hockey sense, better-than-average puck skills for a big man and a commitment to being a force in all zones, Tkachuk can help a team in so many ways. Playing with the edge that has become a family trademark -- dad Keith and brother Matthew have displayed it in their own NHL careers -- I can't imagine Brady Tkachuk is very fun to line up against.

But you have to be more than be big and tough. That's where the hockey sense becomes a separating factor. Tkachuk made confident plays with the puck on his stick during his college days. When he was out there, there was a good chance BU was tilting the ice in their favor. However, that didn't always lead to offense, as he scored just eight goals this season, despite averaging more than three shots on goal per game (131). Tkachuk's point total certainly isn't eye-popping, which is why there is at least some trepidation with him as a top-four pick. That said, I've had a hard time running into scouts who wouldn't take him in the top five, especially once those other three are off the board.","The elder statesman of the 2018 crop missed last year's draft by a single day. Had an adequate season as one of the younger players in the NCAA,  but his lights out World Junior showing moved the needle for many. His hands are soft, his shot is heavy and he plays an abrasive, pro-style game. He'll be a fan favourite.",Big body & isn't afraid to use it. Plays all 200 feet of the rink & loves those dirty areas,,"A top-end winger, he is
an above-average skater,
with a top speed that can
beat defenders wide. His burst
could still be improved, but
his advanced strength makes
up for a lack of quickness
in tight areas. His offensive
awareness stands out and he
always seems to be in the right
position for a one-timer or a
feed to one of his teammates.
For a bigger forward, he has
good puckhandling ability.
He excels at taking passes in
stride, then heading into the
offensive zone with a head of
steam. He does have a habit
of overplaying the puck at
times, trying an extra move
at the offensive blue line and
losing possession, instead of
dumping the puck deep and
forechecking. But he is capable
of impressive moves under
pressure. He has a great shot
and the confidence to fire it
on net from anywhere in the
offensive zone. The release
is quick and the accuracy is
good. With his power, he can
be a force in the offensive zone.
He's not afraid to fight through
contact to make a play. Can
be very aggressive physically
and can pester opponents
relentlessly. But defensively he
could use his strength better. In
his own zone, he's not engaged
every shift. But he does use
his speed to pressure on the
backcheck. He's not afraid to
come down low in his own
end to make positive plays. A
full toolbox which comes as a
result of strong NHL bloodlines."
2018,C,73.25,190.44,5,ARI,,Barret Hayton,"Hayton is one of the best two-way forwards in the draft. His season started off with a great Ivan Hlinka, where he started off as a 50/50 guy to make it, but worked his way not only into a top role but was a top player at the tournament. He followed that up by being one of the better forwards on the top team in the CHL. His hockey IQ is quite impressive. Hayton has the reliable defensive forward sense and work ethic off the puck where he makes good defensive plays and wins pucks, but he has great vision and composure with the puck as well. He can hold it for an extra second to make a play. Hayton has good hands and can make a skilled play to create space. Hayton also features a heavy shot and can finish chances well. The main issue in projecting him to the NHL is his feet. He really doesn't have an explosive element and can struggle to push defenders back off the rush, but he gets where he needs to by working hard.","I've had a tough time truly buying into Hayton's upside this year. He's a coach's dream in that he works extremely hard, he wins races and battles, he's responsible defensively and he nearly always makes the smart, safe play. But he's also more gifted than he  plays; I would like to see him play a high-risk game. He has decent hands and impressive power to his game. I would just like to see him become more than a chip-and-chase cycle player. I suspect he'll become more of a complementary player at the NHL level than a primary option, but I think that could change if Soo's standout core graduates and he is forced to try and play like he's the go-to guy.",,"Not flashy, just effective. Hayton is good at a lot of little detail things. It's why he was able to play a substantial role on one of the deepest and most talented teams in junior hockey this season. Despite his youth, Hayton could be trusted to do pretty much whatever was needed of him. It speaks to how smart of a player he is and the kind of versatility he has. In some ways, it seems like the game slows down a bit for him and he's able to dictate. He doesn't have amazing puck skills, but he uses his frame well and seems to have a knack for where to be in all zones. Hayton is a fluid skater who has an efficient glide. He's not a burner by any means, but he gets up and down the ice well. He's a well-rounded center who would be higher on this list if he had a little bit more of a dynamic element.","Improved speed and strength has been the noteworthy traits in his draft season. A quality release, good vision, quick hands, and can play centre or wing. Is very well regarded in his own end. Has flashed game-breaking stuff deep in the OHL playoffs this spring. A safe player with a projectable future.",,,"A smart and calculated
type of offensive
presence, he can finish
plays. Not especially mobile
or fast on his skates, but he's
strong on the move and
can find another gear when
needed. Not overly flashly,
but he does own fancy puckmoving skills, which means
he can quarterback the power
play. He's deployed to work the
slot with the man-advantage.
Also, he has an incredible
ability to protect the puck and
carry it through traffic. Part of
that is due to his high-end leg
and core strength. He's more of
a disher than a shooter, even
though he has a lightningquick release. He's turned into
a player that's very difficult
to contain or predict. His
work ethic, too, is noticeable.
Frequently, he wheels deep
into his own zone to try to pry
the puck away from attackers.
At times, he can shy away from
the physical stuff. He needs
to add strength to be able
to muscle opponents off the
puck. Scouts saw him, at times,
fail to get inside position on
attackers. Defensive awareness
is OK. He knows how to get
into passing and shooting
lanes to limit opponents. He
has top-end hockey savvy, with
great anticipation, especially
in the offensive zone. Tireless
worker. Expectations are for
high output in 2018-19, which,
according to some scouts,
could translate into a NHL
team's top-six sooner rather
than later."
2018,RW,70.25,196.66,6,DET,,Filip Zadina,"Zadina has been a highly touted prospect for years. He had a great world juniors and was a top player in the QMJHL this season. On a tools level, he's one of the most dynamic players in the draft. Zadina skates well, with a powerful stride that eats up ice efficiently. But his value comes from his skills and shot. He has near elite grade hands, which allows him to be quite elusive. He can create as a playmaker and tends to make good decisions moving the puck, but he's known as a trigger man, with one of the better wrist shots in the draft class. What I love about Zadina is how multi-dimensional he is. He can attack defenses by dangling through guys, he can protect pucks and drive around guys, and he can power his ways past defenders or utilize an inch of space to score from long-distance. He is a highly competitive player who gets high marks for his character and competes his butt off to win puck battles on the ice. He's the complete package offensively and a potential difference maker on any given shift.","Zadina was brilliant on the big stage at the top prospects game and the world juniors (which may have impacted the aforementioned second-overall chatter) and his rookie season in QMJHL merited his top prospect award and first all-star team nods. I like what Zadina offers as a primary carrier on his line, and he can create as a passer and finisher. He is a very high-end handler who can make something happen when you think a play is dead and finds seams with a quick cut or stop-up. He's also one of the better power-play players in this class and craftily draws attention to himself to open up passing lanes. His November 1999 birthdate undoubtedly impacted how quickly he was able to become an impact player in the Q, though.",,"I had Zadina as the No. 2 draft prospect at the midterm, and bumping him down didn't have as much to do with his play as it did Svechnikov's progression. I still think Zadina has a chance to be a major contributor for one of the teams picking in the top five and could make the NHL as early as next season. It depends on which situation he gets drafted into, but there's a lot to like about Zadina.

His offensive skills obviously jump out, but I've always been impressed by the energy with which he plays, his relentlessness in puck pursuit and his commitment to doing whatever is necessary. He nearly made the Czech Republic's team for the world championships but was one of the last cuts. He showed he could hang with pros during the pre-tournament exhibitions, a nice follow-up to his stellar world junior championship and strong junior season with the Halifax Mooseheads.

Zadina does so many things well, but his ability to make plays at high speeds, transition quickly from defending to attacking and score goals at a high rate helped him secure his lofty position in this draft class. While I think Svechnikov and Oliver Wahlstrom are better scorers, Zadina is not far off. His shot is high-end. He has the puck skills to beat defenders one-on-one, create extra space for himself and give himself more options. He also has the patience to make higher-quality plays. Overall, he's going to make a team more threatening.",Uses his size and strength to create space and then delivers electric moves and finishing ability. He's absolutely lethal from the circles down. A tireless worker who loves the big stage. Strong and decisive with the puck. Need a first line winger? He's your man.,"Filip Zadina is a dynamic offensive forward that plays a complete game. A deft and agile skater, he exhibits explosive mobility both up and down the ice. In all three zones, he proactively looks to create problems for the opposition. His awareness is indicative of his high level of hockey sense, and he knows how to make plays and scoring chances materialize. Has a goal scorer's toolbox, complete with the individual puck skills that one comes to expect from today's elite offensive players. The accurate release on his shot is noteworthy and is a defining aspect of his offensive capabilities. Defensively sound, he disrupts lanes and pressures the opposition to make hasty decisions; he is tenacious in pursuit of puck control and transitions up-ice naturally. All-in-all, Zadina can be categorized as both a two-way forward with a well-rounded game and a dominant offensive force.",,"An all-round elite player
with pretty good size,
he is a superb skater.
Very smooth, he is well
balanced and very agile. A
solid youngster on his skates.
Top speed is above average.
So is his acceleration. His feet
are always moving. He's never
stationary, so it seems like
he's everywhere. Scouts rave
about his explosiveness. An
extremely fun player to watch
because he's a threat to score
every time he's on the ice. His
puckhandling is elite and he
often catches defenders flatfooted. He can evade pressure
and protect the puck at high
speeds, and he especially loves
to attack open spaces. He's got
a nose for the net and likes to
set up in that low-slot area.
During battles in the corner
or while being checked, you
don't see him being pushed
away from the puck. His shot is
already considered by scouts
to be at a pro level – in other
words, NHL-ready. Because of
his hockey IQ, he can dominate
games. He also uses his
teammates well. Defensively,
he appears to be aware of his
responsibilities. He will put his
stick in passing lanes and take
his man on the backcheck.
With Halifax, Zadina produced
82 points, including 44 goals,
in 57 appearances. Very high
expectations for the Czech on
draft day. While he does project
as a better winger, he does
have the ability to play down
the middle allowing him to be
a versatile option."
2018,D,70,175,7,VAN,,Quinn Hughes,"Hughes was a second-team All-Star in the Big 10 this past season and is the first of his three talented brothers to become NHL draft eligible. Hughes is the best skater in the draft class, and one of the best skating defensemen I've ever seen at his age. He has incredible agility and ability to get up to a dangerous top speed quickly, and the power he gets from each stride is special. I've never seen a defenseman that can pivot from backwards at full speed to dashing up the ice like he can. He can transition the puck well due to his feet, but his great puck skills and IQ allows him to drive play. He's not a pure dangler, but he controls the puck very well in a way that distinguishes him. He processes the game so well at both ends of the rink and is extremely creative with the puck, allowing him to make unique rushes and distributions. He controls the puck in a unique way and is very tough to dislodge due to his skating, skill and work ethic. While he can make end to end rushes, with his aforementioned smarts, he knows when to pick his spots to make a play or just make a crisp outlet. His passes are always hard and on the tape. The main drawback on him is his size, and its valid in terms of being subpar at winning battles, but his sense and feet allow him to disrupt enough plays to be useful defensively and he's not a huge liability. His point shot could be a tad stronger, as well.","Hughes is on the older side of this draft class as well, but he has done nothing since the beginning of the year that has made me question his status as the second-best defenceman in the class. He's all the things you like about an on-the-small side offensive defenceman. He can cleanly create exits and entries with his feet and outlet passes, he's patient but plays fast, and he does an excellent job using his footwork to open up lanes on net or down low from the blueline, which will allow him to play on an aggressive power play in the NHL. But he's also not any of the things you worry about with smaller defensemen. In spite of his size, he's one of the better man-on-man defenders in the class, plays a tight gap and does a wonderful job disrupting the rush without having to play an overtly physical game. I suspect after another year of college he'll be NHL ready, too.",,"Perhaps the best skater in the draft, Hughes had an exceptional season in the college ranks and showed recently that he might not be terribly far from pro-readiness with a solid showing at the men's world championship in Denmark. He got himself a regular shift at that tournament and was part of Team USA's second power-play unit despite being the only player on the team with no NHL experience. It was a nice way to finish up what had been an especially strong second half of the season for Hughes following a somewhat disappointing world junior championships.

Hughes is one of the more unique defensemen we've seen come through the draft in some years. He is very offense-minded, sometimes jumping into plays to the point where he's leading the rush instead of supporting it. That might rub some coaches the wrong way, but Hughes has had a high level of success so far. He averaged 0.78 points per game, which puts Hughes among a pretty small group of under-19 defensemen over the past decade. He also is one of the highest-scoring defensemen in the history of the vaunted National Team Development Program, ranking fifth all time with 77 career points for a NHL prospect factory.

Despite his size, Hughes also has proven to be an above-average defender, thanks to a good defensive stick and excellent use of body position and angling to cut down bigger players. That last part comes from his elite-level skating, which is among the best I've seen for a draft-eligible defenseman in a long time. His feet get him out of trouble regularly, allow him to get out of his zone and make him a threat offensively. Hughes also has excellent puck-retrieval skills, which he combines with exceptionally quick decision-making to help aid his team's transition. His first touch on pucks, regardless of how they come to him, is one of the details in his game that I find particularly impressive. He absolutely takes risks, and sometimes he'll force things too much, but the potential for reward with what he does allows you to live with it.","A consummate playmaker who boasts the elite speed needed to thrive at his stature. The youngest player in the NCAA this season, his confidence continued to build all season long. He was tremendous for Michigan down the stretch and looked more than capable at the World Championships. The best skater in this class and a one-man breakout machine. He can run a power play with the best of them. Needs some more pop on his shot.","Quinn Hughes is known as an elite defensive talent that has mastered the elements of speed and decision-making. He is calculated in his handling of the puck and well-versed in his ability to limit time and space for the opposition without the puck. It's almost taken for granted, now, that he is a highly skilled offensive player, simply due to his individual ability to carry plays and outfox the opposition in their own end. His creativity and vision is what sets him apart from many other defenders, and he plays that exciting style of hockey that punishes opponents' mistakes with immediacy. It's his proactivity through the neutral zone, not just limiting the time and space for the opposition but limiting their options to move the puck up-ice every time he's on a shift, that makes him so potent. All-in-all, a complete defenceman that understands how to open up a game and take it over",,"An offensive blueliner,
his skating is exceptional
– and the key to his allround game. He's got blazing
end-to-end speed. He's always
going in the same direction
as the game itself. He's fast
and quick and efficient on
his skates. This is a dominant
player, who, against age-group
peers, shines. A dynamo in the
offensive zone, he owns all the
tools to succeed, including
the ability to walk the blue
line looking for prime scoring
opportunities. With confidence,
he's a reliable puck-carrier
and he's tough to contain. He
uses his intelligence to get
separation from incoming
defenders. With controlled
hands, he's proven to be an
adept passer. He loves to join
the rush and create odd-man
chances, but he's trying to
show that he can be a 200-foot
player. His defensive game
is a work in progress, but he
plays aggressively in his own
zone. He can be a little bit of
a pest, who isn't afraid of a
little trash-talking. One area of
improvement – he could focus
more on poise and being in
control. Sometimes, he rushes
plays or forces something that
isn't necessarily available. But
there is definite upside to his
decision-making ability. His
lack of size will raise some
questions, but his mobility
and puck-movement more
than make up for any stature
deficiencies. There is definitely
some elite potential here in this
defenseman."
2018,D,71.5,165.4,8,CHI,,Adam Boqvist,"Boqvist started off his draft season with one of the best Ivan Hlinka performances I've seen from a defenseman. He struggled at times at the pro level, but did quite well versus his peer group and projects very well due to his high-end skill set. His hands and IQ all get very high grades. He's very skilled and creative with the puck, on top of displaying top-level, if not elite, vision. He also has great offensive instincts and knows how to jump into the attack and create chances. Boqvist made some of the best passes and most creative plays I saw from any prospect at any level this season. What I love about him is his attacking mindset. He's always looking to jump up and make a play, looking for opportunities and wants to make a difference in the game. He attacks like a soccer player who will use one touch passes as a way to open seams to get a through pass. Boqvist skates well with the ability to lead a rush and he closes his gaps well defensively, but his skating isn't as much of a standout trait as his brain. His shot from the point is quite good as well and he's very skilled at getting it through traffic, showing high shot generation numbers everywhere he goes. On defense, he's small and not that physical. I've seen him make stops effectively versus players his age — not at an elite level, but more than passable.  Versus men he's struggled to win battles as a small, slight player.","By now, I have a pretty good feel for where Boqvist is at in his development and the conclusions I've come exist in two parts:

He is unquestionably one of the most talented puck handlers and creators in this class — at forward or defence — off the rush. He's a brilliant distributor and a fabulous skater who takes a lot of risks and generates a ton offensively as a result.
He's also still got a long way to go defensively, and that makes him more of a long-term project than a lot of the other high-end defenders in this class, and also more of a risk-reward proposition at the draft. He's easily pushed around and he's tentative in his engages, which results in a lot of lost battles.
Still, even if there is bust potential, the former is still worth betting on because there's huge upside to his game and his first few steps allow him to create separation from forecheckers and exit the defensive zone with ease. He's also got one of the better shots among the defencemen in the class (both in accuracy and in power, which he generates with technique and a nifty low-kick release rather than pure strength), and isn't afraid to jump into the high slot to use it.",,"One of the big risers for me this season, Kotkaniemi grows on me with each viewing. To me, he's the top center in the draft by a fairly large margin due to his combination of power, skill and all-around instincts. He is committed to playing a tough game in all zones, engages physically and has high-end puck skills that make him an offensive threat. While a natural center, he played primarily on the wing in the pro ranks.

Kotkaniemi finished third among U-20 players in Liiga play with 29 points; only Jets first-rounder Kristian Vesalainen and 1998-born Jerry Turkulainen were ahead of him. Playing a regular shift in Liiga at 17 and producing at the rate he did is pretty impressive. In fact, his 29 points rank eighth all time for a U-18 player in Liiga, notably ahead of former first-rounders such as Jesse Puljujarvi, Tuomo Ruutu and Teuvo Teravainen. Kotkaniemi also dominated in his age group's international tournaments playing center.

""Jesperi is an exceptional playmaker,"" says Tommi Niemela, who has coached Kotkaniemi with the Finnish junior national teams. ""He can make plays out of nowhere. He wins stick battles and has a really good shot. I wish he would use it more.""","Dynamic puck skills, terrific vision, high-end quickness, top speed, smarts, and a heavy shot. His late birthday means he is just a month away from being eligible for the 2019 class further illustrating how massive his potential is. Has a big shot and loves to unload it. Concluding his season against peers at the U18's was exactly what he needed to demonstrate his elite skillset. Oozes potential but carries a touch of risk.","A dynamic offensive defenceman that can carry plays with the puck on his stick. A highly mobile and nimble skater that moves with fluidity, balance, and confidence. Utilizes an active stick and creates turnovers frequently. Could be more proactive in his own end, but has shown progression in understanding lanes and reading unfolding plays; most of his best defensive work comes through the neutral zone, as there is a lot less time and space to work with, and it is in those moments that Boqvist shines.

Offensively, Boqvist is electric; he has the toolbox of a top line forward. Slick puckhandling ability paired with excellent vision and positional awareness makes him a dangerous threat every time he is on the ice. He also takes advantage of the attention and bodies he draws towards himself in creating space for teammates. All-in-all, Adam Boqvist is a complete offensive defenseman who knows how to get the puck from point A to the back of the net, and can make it happen all by himself. ",,"An offensive blueliner,
he owns a fluid skating
stride and great balance,
which allows him to carry
the puck coast-to-coast and
around the offensive zone. He
is a constant threat with the
puck in his possession. With his
great puckhandling and elite
first step and acceleration, he
can win one-on-one situations
and create odd-man rushes for
his team. His ability to control
the puck and make plays at
high pace is impressive. He's
a natural on the power play,
understanding what works
and what doesn't. With great
vision, he can pick apart
penalty-killers with his crisp
and accurate passing from
the point. His slapshot is very
good – both powerful and
accurate. Ditto his wrister.
However, defensively, he can
be an adventure. His decisions
run to high risk, instead of
safeguarding, in his own zone,
which can be problematic. At
other times, he's too passive,
even in clearing out the front
of his own net. He is too
easily pushed around and he
loses lots of battles by being
outworked or outmuscled. In
the neutral zone, where he
can use his speed and vision
to read plays, he's much more
comfortable. Offensively, many
of his tools are already elite,
but he needs to add upperbody strength, especially
before he starts playing more
games against men. He has the
potential to be an explosive
difference-maker in the NHL."
2018,RW,74.75,184,9,NYR,,Vitali Kravtsov,"Kravtsov improved as the season went along. After being cut from Russia's World Junior Championship team, he finished with one of the best postseasons I've ever seen from a teenager in a pro league, becoming a go-to player for his KHL team, a member of the second power play and a top nine regular on a team that went to the KHL's final four. He's got an interesting toolkit. He's 6-foot-2, skates rather well, shows flashes of dynamic hands and is pretty coordinated for his size. He can push defenders back with speed and gain the offensive zone with control. His edge work/elusiveness is decent, too. While he can make some nice plays and shows good creativity, I think he's more of a finisher than a playmaker; someone who could drive his offense in the NHL through leading on zone entries and finishing chances from a distance. His vision looked better to me this season than last, but he's not going to be a guy who hovers around looking for options. He'll need work off the puck, too, as he can get pushed off pucks a little too easily for a big man; but when he uses his body, his frame protects the puck well. I've seen him be used at center, but he projects most likely as a winger. I watched him a lot this season and truthfully did not think what I saw matched his incredible KHL production, but it's hard to ignore his progress and he does still have a very good skillset.","The only player to move from the midseason ranking into what I now believe is a clearly defined top 16, Kravtsov took his game to a new level in the KHL's playoffs and finished third on Traktor in scoring in the process, with 11 points in 16 games. That makes him the highest-scoring under-19 playoff performer in the history of the KHL, ahead of Valeri Nichuskin's nine points in 25 games in 2013 and Eeli Tolvanen's seven in 11 this year. He's a big kid who can really move and still has room to get stronger and fill out. He has also played all three forward positions successfully. Kravtsov is the kind of player who can take over a game when he's at his best and dominate possession by winning back pucks and playing aggressively. He certainly doesn't lack confidence either, and doesn't shy away from attempting to make high-end plays. You have to respect him, or he'll burn you. There's a lot of raw talent there, and I can't wait to see what he does with more minutes in the KHL next year.",,"A highly-skilled player with size, Kravtsov really shot up the charts with his playoff performance in the KHL. The big winger had 11 points in 16 games for Traktor in the postseason, a new high-water mark for players under the age of 20 in the Gagarin Cup playoffs. To have done that at 18 years old is truly remarkable. It wasn't just the late-season production that stood out, though. Kravtsov's ability to attack opposing players and confidence in making plays at a time of year when it's harder to do those kinds of things really stood out.

His puck skills are high end, and he has a good shot. He's still developing more of a power game, but already shows a propensity for getting to the middle of the ice and going to the harder areas for the sake of offense. Relative to the class, he seems like a bit of a late bloomer, having never played for Russia at any major international event (a rarity for a prospect as highly regarded as Kravtsov).

I really like what Kravtsov did in the KHL playoffs, his skills and his size, but I had just enough doubt about his long-term ceiling to keep him out of the top 20, despite the fact he's risen up so many boards of late.",A smooth skater with skill to burn managed to produce a few points in the KHL regular season as a 17-year-old – no easy feat. He followed that up with an explosion of goals as a go-to option during the playoffs and has seen his stock rightly rise. Came into the season lacking exposure due to not being selected for Russia's international squads but that's changed this season. Is a highly talented player with soft hands and pro-level release. Will be deadly down low on the PP.,"A big, skilled winger that can play up and down the lineup and provide scoring in a number of roles. He brings grit and physical size, but could be more assertive in throwing his weight around more. Displays excellent speed on the rush and in zone entry, but could backcheck quicker. Plays well in his own end and takes away lanes. Very good hands and awareness. Kravtsov has the potential to develop into a staple top six forward that can produce at the next level.",,"A dynamic forward, he
can really skate. Fast
on his feet with great
acceleration and no hesitation
to use it. He's deceptive when
stickhandling with the puck,
having the ability to make
highlight-reel plays look
routine and easy. He is adept
at moving around and through
defenders, either one-on-one
or when navigating through
traffic. Not surprisingly, he has a
lot of confidence in possession.
He should. Very strong off
the rush. He has good overall
hockey sense. He has the ability
to play both wings, but he
appears more comfortable on
his natural side. He possesses
a good wrister, which he can
uncork after using his wheels
to get close to the net. Release
is the best part of his shot. It
doesn't take much time at all
for him to get the puck off
his stick. He's a good, but not
necessarily great, playmaker.
He could stand to bulk up his
already-solid frame because
strength will be a big key to his
development moving forward.
As it is, he's not physical. In fact,
he tries to avoid contact and
he is able to do so by using
his speed to stay away from
incoming defenders. In the
words of one bird-dog, he's
“darty” on the ice. Without the
puck, though, he can get a little
lost, especially in his own end.
But he does try to be reliable
defensively. At a young age,
he's been productive in the
KHL – 11 points in 16 playoff
appearances"
2018,D,74,195.68,10,EDM,,Evan Bouchard,"Bouchard was fantastic for London this season and was a huge part of why a rebuilding team ended up finishing in a significant playoff spot. He put up monster counting numbers and generated a ton of shots on goal while playing half the game most nights. His counting numbers were one of the best ever by a U19 defenseman in the OHL. Bouchard put up a lot of points for a reason. He has a hard, dangerous shot and can be a primary trigger guy on an NHL power play. The more I've watched him the more I appreciate his vision, with one scout referring to him as a general in how well and calmly he moves the puck. He has a lot of poise in the offensive zone to wait out options. I think his hands and skating are good but not great. He can get a little upright in his stride, which takes away power, but he can get up and down the ice well and shows good speed. He'll need to continue improving defensively in his reads/battles to be solid defensively as a pro, but he's shown progress there and took the tough matchups this season.","There has been a lot made of Bouchard's supposed sluggish stride of late. Truthfully, I think a lot of it is overstated. Is he the fabulous skater that Merkley, Dahlin, Boqvist and co. are? No. He's on the older side of this draft, so his room for growth as a skater is going to be smaller than most, but he was also the second-fastest backwards skater at the top prospects game combine and he defends extremely well. I think part of the perception about Bouchard's skating is actually our eyes playing tricks on us because he plays a different game stylistically than the defencemen we're accustomed to ranking in a draft's top 10. Bouchard produces and generates offensively without needing to play a flashy game. He was the most productive defenceman in junior hockey by playing with his head up and making a number of simple but aggressive plays in the same shift, rather than one big play. He finds teammates in dangerous spots in the offensive zone by leading them there with a pass or drawing attention by patiently hanging onto the puck if he has to. He defends well off the rush, he wins battles along the wall through body positioning and efficient routes and he's got an excellent, low-windup shot that is second only to Vegas draftee Nic Hague in the OHL. I think you're looking at a player who has all-situations potential. I can't say that about many defenders in this draft.",,"Bouchard makes a lot of things look pretty easy. He plays the game at his own pace with very few wasted movements. He's very relaxed thanks to high-end offensive sense and maturity with the puck on his stick. Bouchard has elite-level distribution skills, which allow him to find teammates in space and get the puck out of his own zone quickly. He's a solid defender who can engage physically, though no one would confuse him for a shutdown type.

Bouchard was the top-scoring defenseman in the OHL by nine points this season. His 87 points in 67 games put him eighth overall in the league. It's also the fourth-highest scoring season in the OHL for a defenseman at any age over the past 20 years. The only defensemen ahead of Bouchard are Ryan Ellis (twice) and Anthony DeAngelo. It's eye-popping, especially considering Bouchard was one of only a few remaining top players London held on to after the OHL trade deadline this year. He played a mountain of minutes and helped keep the Knights competitive after losing so many talented players.

One of the knocks on Bouchard is that despite his high numbers, he doesn't have a lot of dynamic elements in his game outside of being a good passer. He has good mobility, good awareness, adequate defensive skills and a decent physical game. His maturity will be tested at the next level when he has more experienced, craftier players he'll have to contend with. That said, with how easy he has made things look in juniors, I'll be really interested to see how long a look he gets in training camp by his drafting team.","A strong puck-moving defender who took on all the tough minutes on a depleted Knights' squad. Runs the power play with precision, uses his big shot with impunity and finds a way onto the scoresheet most nights. Lacks dynamic skills that jump out at you, so it's sometimes hard to fall in love with him, but he's a workhorse and that gets the job done. Is a volume shooter but has very nice vision and offensive instincts. Needs to quicken his feet and his pace as he transitions up.","A highly intelligent all-around defenceman that plays with poise and can shift the pace of play in a multitude of ways. Showcases smooth four-way skating ability and loves to get involved in all situations - especially when that situation happens to be an up-ice rush. Has a polished offensive skill-set which includes well-timed passes and a sneaky, erratic shot. Goes with the high percentage play and makes smart decisions. Could work on strength behind his shot. Defensively active, cutting off lanes and always staying in excellent positioning. Reads cues well in all three zones and seems to stay a step ahead. All-in-all, a well-rounded defender with great hockey sense and work ethic.",,"One of the OHL's top
defenders and one of
the best blue-liners
available in this draft, he is an
explosive skater. His passing
ability is elite. He unleashes
feeds into unmanned areas
and, for a moment, they look
like wasted attempts until a
teammate zips into space and
take the pass right on the tape.
And he boasts an enviable
variety of puck-distributing
moves – stretch passes, drop
passes, floating saucers. And if
he's not dishing to teammates,
he can skate the puck into
the offensive zone. His shot
isn't particularly strong from
the point, but he's able to find
little lane openings and put it
exactly where he wants – often
into the back of the net. Of
his 87 points, 25 were goals,
many of them from the blue
line through traffic. From his
position at the point, he has
the knack of holding the line
and keeping the puck alive
inside the opposition's blue
line. His puck movement
from there is sharp. He was
deployed by London in all key
situations, but on the power
play he could show variety in
shot selection, opting at times
for the quickly released wrister.
However, he could stand to
be more aggressive in his own
zone, including clearing traffic
in front of his netminder, but
he's got the basics covered.
Good positionally, even if,
occasionally, he's slow to return
to the proper spot if lured
away."
2018,RW,73.25,208.38,11,NYI,,Oliver Whahlstrom,"Wahlstrom has been one of the best snipers to pass through the USNTDP in its history and is the best pure goal scorer in this draft class. While everyone knows him for his shot and goal scoring ability,  he has a very desirable combination of high-end skill and physical attributes to go with his shot. Wahlstrom has the capability to carry a line due to his skill and creativity, and generates a lot of clean entries. He's more of a shooter than a playmaker, but he can certainly make tough passes when he needs to. Wahlstrom has an elite shot and can score from a distance, with a special instinct in terms of seeing shot lanes develop and knowing how to beat goalies. He puts himself in spots to get his deadly one-timer and wrist shots through. His shots on goal totals this season are off the charts and equal to the best snipers to ever play in the USHL and/or USNTDP at his age. He's OK defensively, I've seen him be passable on the PK and, while he can be strong on the puck, he's not going to throw his body around a ton. He can skate fine, although I think sometimes he plays slower than he should, but he can get around the ice without issue and push defenders back off zone entries.","What's that sound? Do you hear that? If you listen closely, it might be Harvard's goal horn. If he looks like a goal scorer and shoots like a goal scorer, he's probably a goal scorer. If Svechnikov is the best scorer in the class, Wahlstrom isn't far behind. The clear-cut best player in the national program this year, Wahlstrom was utterly dominant at Five Nations and then did the same at U18s for the United States, where he scored seven times in as many games. He needs less time to get his release off than any other player in this draft and it allows him to score from anywhere in the offensive zone. He's also a strong enough skater off the rush that defenders are forced to back off of him to avoid getting burned wide and that creates time and space for him to change the angle of his shot and shoot through them. He's also just a hard-working kid and gets in on the forecheck to win pucks back and attack. He's got game-breaking upside few in this class have and he has progressed faster than anyone.",,"Wahlstrom has such a natural ability to find the net that I think he absolutely belongs in the conversation for being a top-four pick. I wouldn't bat an eye if it happened, but he needs to work on his game away from the puck and needs to establish consistency of effort. I've seen marked progression in his game over multiple viewings this season.

The American came into the year stronger, developed more of a power game and became more of a physical force. While his defensive game is subpar, his offensive game is elite. For a kid who was a viral sensation by age 9 with his highlight-reel shootout attempts at TD Garden, Wahlstrom doesn't overly rely on his hands, which are above average.

He is starting to separate himself with his skating, as well. He has a powerful stride and continues to get faster, which allows him to exploit gaps and play with speed in transition. Wahlstrom averaged 4.6 shots per game this season with an astonishing 288 shots on goal, 48 of which went in the net. On top of having a tremendous release, Wahlstrom's shot is deceptive, accurate and heavy. The puck explodes off his stick, challenging every goalie he comes across. He recently committed to Boston College, but I would not be surprised if a team considered starting him in the AHL as early as next season due to his physical development and remarkable offensive skill set.",Owns the best release in the class. The goal-scoring forward doesn't shy away from attacking dangerous scoring areas and boasts strong speed and quick feet. A volume-shooter who is deadly from the left circle on the power-play. Feasts on penalty killers. Terrific pure puck skills. Off to Boston College in the fall. This kid is going to score a boatload of goals in the NHL.,"A sensational scoring threat, Oliver Wahlstrom is a fierce competitor that preys on weak play. He exploits gaps in the neutral zone; his positioning allows him to carry the puck forward immediately or shift up and into stride off of an outlet pass. He promptly takes easy lanes away from the opposition along his own blue line, but could stand to be more proactive defensively. Offensively, he might be described as uncontainable: the confidence he has in his individual puck skill, paired with a high level of thinking, makes him a difficult cog to take out of alignment. He is able to create opportunities for himself, as well as teammates, out of nothing; this, in turn, translates to energy on the ice and in the building as a whole. All-in-all, Oliver Wahlstrom is an instinct-driven hockey player gifted with the size, skating, skill, and smarts that coaches yearn for.",,"A noticeable and dynamic

skating ability and the talent

a tonne of space for himself

vision makes him dangerous,

Quincy, Mass., native possesses
pull-you-out-of-your-seat skill,
which he can display at top

tight, he can use his powerful

he's elusive. His shot is good,

2018,D,75,176.74,12,NYI,,Noah Dobson,"Dobson was a monster for Bathurst this season, logging a ton of minutes in all situations, earning first-team all-star honors in the QMJHL and being an important part of why they were one of the better teams in the league. What's noticeable in Dobson is how much more confident he is with the puck this season in terms of his vision and holding onto it for that extra second. He shows good vision and has QB'ed the first PP unit, making excellent decisions with the puck and showing great poise on top of getting a ton of shots through. He's a good if not a high-end skater, can activate quite well into the attack for a big man and, with his size/mobility, he can stay with most attackers without issue. His puck skills aren't as standout as his brain/skating, but he can handle the puck fine and make the odd move to create space. I don't know if the high level of points and shots on goal he's shown this season translates to the NHL at the same level, but he could be a power play guy as a pro, while taking tough defensive matchups in a team's top four. Getting stronger and being a tad more physical are the keys for Dobson going forward.","I was way higher than most on Dobson at the beginning of the year, but I think some of his upside has been overstated at this point. He's a big kid and an extremely mobile skater who uses both of those attributes to defend well off the rush and force forwards to the outside to limit chances against. There's no question his first all-star team nod was deserved. But I see No. 2/3 upside in him, not the No. 1 some believe he may become. He's closer to the NHL than a lot of the players in this draft, but I don't think he has the offensive gifts, even with mobility and a dangerous shot he does an excellent job getting through traffic, for him to become the 40-50-point threat those ranked ahead of him have in them. I would also like to see him use his size to his advantage a little more. When he joins the rush, he tends to push himself into the offensive zone corner rather than attack the net. When he defends, he could stand to use his skating to more aggressively close gaps and force turnovers. It doesn't hurt that he's a righty.",,"For the entire season, I've had such a hard time slotting Dobson. He has many fans in the scouting community due to his solid defensive game. He showed this year that his offensive instincts are better than previously believed, as he tends to identify opportunities for offense really well. That was on display at the Memorial Cup, as he helped Acadie-Bathurst win the title while playing a ton of minutes and contributing at both ends of the ice.

He is possibly one of the best pure defenders in the draft. His awareness, positioning, gap control and battle level along the walls and at the net front all put him on good footing to be a top-four defenseman at the next level. A lot gets thrown at him in his role with the Titan, and he just handles it all.

I think Dobson skates fine, though I'm not enamored with his stride. He gets to where he needs to be, and I think he's efficient in how he uses the ice, especially in his ability to close on opposing attackers. Dobson has a solid frame with room to get a bit bigger and stronger. What I've seen out of Dobson is he carries himself like a pro, plays a pro-friendly game and will probably be the kind of prospect a team doesn't have to worry about as he gets into its system.","A right-shot defender who has all the tools to be an all-around top-four producer. Had a terrific year with Acadia-Bathurst of the QMJHL, leading them to a Memorial Cup victory. Brings high-end processing ability, soft hands and a willingness to take calculated risks. A smooth and powerful skater. Often logs 30-plus minutes a night with ease. Reminiscent of Alex Pietrangelo.","A talented two-way defenceman that can play in all situations and stay productive. Uses his edges well and is, for the most part, a very smooth skater; however, as he gets stronger and adjusts to a more up-tempo style of hockey, he will need to work on his speed in gap-closing. Offensively, he utilizes his keen sense of awareness to be in the right spot at the right time, every time. Soft hands and a deadly shot accentuate his ability to get creative, on occasion. Rock solid defensively, his strong positioning severely limits time and space for the opposition. All-in-all, a well-rounded, reliable, and consistent defenceman that can log a lot of ice time and provide his team with a stable presence on the back end.",,"A two-way defender, he
is extremely mobile.
Even if he is tall and
lanky, his skating stride is
strong. His great athleticism
allows him to get smooth
transitions from forward to
backward. He is fairly quick for
his size, too. He is comfortable
handling the puck while
skating backward through the
neutral and defensive zones,
patiently hanging on to it until
he makes a decision. He has
great gap control, thanks to his
long reach and solid skating
ability. Too, he does a good
job of pushing forwards to the
outside. He maybe doesn't
use his size as much as he
should, but his strength is still
developing and he certainly
doesn't shy away from the
rough stuff. Positionally sound.
He impresses scouts with his
smart offensive creativity and
nice upside. With the puck
on his stick, he can control
games. He can skate with it or,
equally, shift it to a teammate.
He moves the puck quickly on
the rush, hitting forwards in
stride or dumping the puck
into the offensive zone. He
shows decent awareness of the
offensive zone, occasionally
pinching down the boards
to pressure the opposing
breakout. However, he doesn't
show enough aggressiveness,
rarely coming down further
than the hashmarks. Instead,
he has a tendency of uncorking
long point shots or simply
pushing the puck down along
the boards for his forwards."
2018,C,70.25,183.58,13,DAL,,Ty Dellandrea,"Dellandrea was Flint's best player this season, being a great all-around contributor for a struggling team and generating a ton of shots on net. Dellandrea has a lot of positive elements to his game, and although he doesn't do anything at a high-end level, it's also hard to find a weakness in his game. He's a good skater who can build speed well going through the neutral zone. He's very powerful at full speed with a strong frame that is hard to contain when he drives to the net or tries to beat a defender to the outside. Dellandrea can make a skilled play to get a zone entry, showing the odd flash of higher level skill and has above-average vision. His shot is heavy and he can finish chances when he gets them. Dellandrea also is a quality defensive center who can kill penalties well and take critical draws. Coaches will love his versatility, but he has enough talent to be a valuable scoring asset too.",,,"Dellandrea has gone up and down my board throughout the year, but never strayed terribly far from the top 30. I think his skill level showed more as the season progressed. Despite playing on a poor team in Flint, Dellandrea still took over some games. That's not easy to do when there's so much focus on you as the team's best forward. While his production isn't necessarily jumping out at anybody, his continued improvement over the course of the year should. I think he has higher-end puck skills, possesses the confidence to make plays and is a good enough skater to give opposing teams problems. I'd expect a big step forward from him next season assuming he gets a little stronger and maybe gets some help in Flint.","Anchored with a bottom-feeding junior club in Flint, Dellandrea produced on his own most nights. The shoot-first centre offers good quickness, is effective on the power-play and owns a strong work ethic. A noteworthy U18 tournament culminated a successful individual season.",,,"A hard-working pivot, he
can be a complete twoway player, especially

size and determination, he's
very difficult to knock off the

2018,LW,72,161.66,14,PHI,,Joel Farabee,"Farabee had a great season for the USNTDP being one of their best all-around forwards. I wouldn't describe Farabee as a dynamic offensive player, but he does a lot well. Farabee handles the puck at an above-average level, can make defenders miss, and can both create chances and finish them. He skates fine, he lacks a true separation gear, but he can push the pace when he needs to, works hard and, with his hustle, gets to where he needs to go. Farabee wins battles despite being undersized, being a reliable defensive forward, and was one of the best penalty killers for the NTDP, including being a shorthanded threat. His best attribute is his intelligence. Farabee shows great overall instincts as a playmaker and makes consistently good decisions at a quick pace. While he put up very good numbers this season, I am skeptical of him projecting out as a very impactful offensive player as a pro. He'll become a coach's favorite though with how reliable and hard he works every shift combined with a good talent level.","Farabee is one of those players who won't break open a game with pure skill, but will finish after 18-20 minutes of ice time with a goal or an assist and a huge backcheck to prevent one at the other end. He's a high-end skater and he uses it to play an aggressive forecheck, break up plays and retrieve possession. He may not become a first-line player but he's got better playmaking and scoring touch than he's given credit for in Wahlstrom's shadow. He can escape trouble with light footwork on his edges or a deft curl in tight to his body. Once he gets stronger, he's got a very good chance of becoming an excellent two-way forward who can play with shooters or playmakers. Give him a couple years at Boston University and you may get something really special. He's going to be a reliable NHL player.",,"Few players mix work ethic with skill the way Farabee does. Unafraid to go to the hard areas of the ice and possessing a commitment to a solid all-around game, Farabee checks a lot of boxes, including his overall smarts. Good hockey sense allows Farabee to excel in a variety of roles, but he has enough skill to be a higher-end contributor. While he lacks dynamic puck skills, Farabee is both effective with the puck on his stick and possesses good speed. He finds ways to create extra space for himself and has an ability to make good decisions under pressure. His competitive edge allows him to hang onto the puck a little bit longer to shake off the check and make a better play than what's immediately available to him. Farabee also has a solid shot. Slated to attend Boston University next season, Farabee will have a chance to tack on the needed muscle to maximize his playing style.","Slight and slippery, he feasts on oppositions with his vision and his finishing ability. A great skater who works tirelessly in all three zones. Had a tremendous season with the USNTDP this year. He thrived while playing with Wahlstrom and 2019-eligible super-prospect, Jack Hughes, and didn't miss a beat while anchoring his own line. Needs to add strength but does all the little things that make players successful. Can hurt the opposition during all situations. He'll add strength and that will only further his impact. Off to BU in the fall.",Dangerous two-way forward who uses his legs and IQ to make something happen most shifts,,"Blessed with strong
two-way puck sense, he
is an appealing prospect.
Not a tonne of flash in his
game, but Farabee has no
glaring holes in his game,
which makes him an effective
player. Skating, he works off
his edges and opens up ice.
He'll not shy to drive towards
the net and he knows how to
find the soft spots on the ice.
His shot is quick-released and
he knows how to use it – and
how to make a quick pass
instead. The only drawback
to his distribution game is
that sometimes he'll pass up a
terrific shooting opportunity
and opt for an attempt at a
highlight-reel setup, which can
end up as turnovers. This crops
up especially on power plays.
He's shown lots of deception in
the short game. Consistently,
he creates chances with his
skating and his playmaking
ability. He stickhandles close
to his body and can escape
pressure situations with quick
moves. The Cicero, N.Y., native's
compete level is high. He'll
race for the puck and battle
along the wall in all three

attack a defender and suffocate

aggressiveness making plays

His numbers might not jump out at you, but trust me, his play on the ice does. He's dynamic around the puck. His puck skills and vision are high-end. He controls the puck so well and is always looking to make a play. Denisenko is very creative and he can make a highlight reel play. His speed isn't as dangerous as his skill, but he skates well and can push defensemen back, which, combined with his skill, leads to lots of controlled entries. I've seen him take draws at times in the Russia league and kill penalties well, including being dangerous shorthanded. I'd like to see his shot be more lethal, but it's about average. I'd like to see him produce more as well he's a small guy who also has some discipline issues, but I see so many plus components that I'm a big believer in his potential.",,,"One of the more dynamic players in the draft, Denisenko has an element of entertainment in his game. Despite not having great size, he's got some grittiness to him and sometimes plays over the edge a little bit.

Pair Denisenko with a high-end shooter, and you've got a match made in heaven, as he is certainly a pass-first player. While he prefers to dish the puck, he can absolutely shoot it with a quick release, too. His play away from the puck is fair, but certainly will need some work.","A creative player with the puck who can dart in and out of the lanes with expert edgework, quick acceleration, and creative lines.

His talent hasn't always resulted in points but it sure jumps off the page.",displays high skill level and skating agility with the puck on his stick…a playmaker with the shooting ability to finish chances himself,,"An offensive catalyst,
smooth and precise,
he's a very noticeable
player who can create scoring
chances and play physically.
His skating is smooth, with lots
of agility and an impressive
top end. He possesses a quick
release, something he's not
afraid to show off in a variety
of situations. A dangerous
shooter. His puck skills and
fine hands make him a
constant threat. He sees the
ice at an elite level. Quick and
athletic, he has no problem
eluding defenders. He'll zip
around the offensive zone,
confidently shielding the
puck from opposition players.
One on one, he is willing to
attempt something fancy. One
scout called his playmaking
ability under-rated because
his passing skills are notable.
Not the biggest player, kind
of slight, but Denisenko is a
tough competitor who likes to
play the body. Always on the
look-out for places to deliver
heavy hits and finish checks,
even if sometimes that pulls
him out of position or gets
him in trouble with penalties.
He plays with an edge – and
sometimes goes over the
edge. Fending off opponents
in the defensive zone is one of
the few things that give him
problems.There are consistency
issues, particularly away from
the puck. Plus, Denisenko can
be a moody player if his team is
trailing, but maturity may take
care of that. He is a natural goal
scorer."
2018,RW,73,175,16,COL,,Martin Kaut,"Kaut had a very good season between the top Czech pro league and the world juniors, and fared quite well for a player his age on the Czech national team. Kaut isn't a dynamic offensive player, but he has a lot of above-average qualities with arguably no weakness in his game. He has noticeable skill with the puck, and is able to create space with his coordination and creativity. He has very impressive vision and seems to always be in the right place at the right time. While I like him more as a playmaker, he can finish his chances as well. Kaut is a two-way forward who can kill penalties due to his work ethic and smarts. He also shows decent puck protection skills. He's an average skater, not slow, but I don't see a separation gear. Kaut is probably a winger long-term, but I've seen him be effective at taking draws.","Kaut is one of those players who just gets it. He plays a confident offensive game while still being relatively mistake-free because he doesn't take unnecessary risks, even though he's always trying to make plays. He was excellent in a good pro league as an 18-year-old and a star at the world juniors without looking the least bit out of place alongside Zadina, Filip Chytil and Martin Necas. There's an argument to be made for Kaut to be ranked higher because I think the odds that he becomes an NHL player are really strong, but the combination of his October 1999 birthday and his general lack of truly high-end tools suggest to me that he probably tops out as a middle-six forward.",,"After a standout World Juniors performance, Kaut really started garnering attention. He was playing on the top line with Filip Zadina and Martin Necas and was far from a passenger with those two elite players. Kaut was more of a playmaker on that line, happy to set up the other two for the goals and playing a key role in puck possession. His patience with the puck and offensive vision are of the high-end variety. The only U20 player in the Czech pro ranks with more points than his 16 was Necas, who is presently among the best prospects in hockey. Additionally, Kaut was under consideration to play for the men's national team at the Worlds this year, but narrowly missed out. One potential cause for concern is that Kaut was sent home from the NHL draft combine with a minor medical issue. By all accounts, it's not something that will affect him long-term, but it is a thing that teams are going to be monitoring very closely in the build-up to the draft and could lead to a slide for the highly-talented winger.","A right-shot winger who had his coming out party for the Czechs at the World Junior Championships with seven points in as many games. He's a late '99 birthdate so he's older but produced very strong numbers in the Czech top league this season – comparable to Martin Necas and Filip Chytil a season ago. He's quick, elusive and knows how to finish.",the combination of his passing and shooting ability makes him a threat on the powerplay,,"A highly touted winger,
he is not particularly
explosive on his
skates, but his top speed
is commendable. Overall,
he moves very well. Even
compared to his older peers
on the Czech Republic's U-20
squad, he plays a mature game.
Due to his high hockey IQ, he
is capable of making smart
decisions with the puck. He
understands the overall game.
So, despite his relative lack of
experience, he is handed the
keys to the power play. With
the man advantage, he took
over, assuming an important
role, working the wing and
serving as the puck distributor.
He displays great patience
with the puck and didn't flinch
in the face of pressure from
defenders. He is heady and
strong enough to protect the
puck nicely and he is confident
enough to carry the puck all
over the ice. Almost every
determination he makes with
the puck is the right one.
Fantastic instincts. He appears,
at times, to be a mistake-free
kind of player. He possesses a
variety of shots – with no fear
of using all of them – and he
can fire the puck with authority
from almost anywhere on the
ice. His wrister, in particular, is
strong and powerful. Strong
passer, with plenty of pep on
his feeds. Plenty to like about
the forward, who, in his second
year with Pardubice of the
Czech men's league, registered
16 points, including nine goals,
in 38 appearances."
2018,D,70.75,176.1,17,NJD,,Ty Smith,"Smith has been very good this season, playing all situations for Spokane and putting up big numbers to live up to the promise that made him the first overall pick in his WHL bantam draft. He is one of the youngest first-team all-stars in the WHL in modern history. Smith is a good skater who can get up the ice and lead a rush. He has above-average puck skills and can make the odd dynamic play, showing skill on the attack or creating space for a zone exit. His best trait is his hockey IQ, as his instincts and decision-making with the puck are very good. He's so smooth handling the puck and rarely seems to get pressured even in tight spaces. For better or for worse, he likes to slow the game down. He has a unique look to his game, where he always has his head up processing everything going on around him. Sometimes he overthinks and could speed up his pace, but he's always trying to make a play. Despite not having elite speed, he can lead an attack due to his craftiness and ability to spot openings. Smith is small, but he's decent defensively due to his feet and IQ. He works to get to pucks and can be trusted to play in all situations — even if his calling card is more on the offensive side of the puck. His scoring numbers in the WHL this season were the best by a 17-year defenseman in over 15 years. He has a unique trait in the way he sees and thinks the game on the ice, and he was the top academic player in his WHL conference off the ice.","Smith is without question one of the only truly elite skaters in the 2018 draft. He uses his feet and edgework to evade checks, close gaps and join the rush. It also makes him unpredictable in the offensive zone because his skating allows him to straddle the blueline, change directions or become a fourth forward as a carrier, and he draws a lot of attention as a result. He's also smart about the decisions that he makes, and rarely gets caught playing selfishly or overcommitting offensively. I do wonder if his size will limit him at the next level as more of a utility option though — and he certainly benefitted in production by playing alongside Kailer Yamamoto, Jaret Anderson-Dolan and co. in Spokane. He's not afraid to box out or engage along the wall, but he does struggle to because of his size. I really didn't like his play at the top prospects game or U18s when he didn't have the benefit of playing on one of the WHL's best teams, but both are tiny samples as part of a more impressive whole.",,"It has been a year of growth for Miller, who didn't have a whole lot of physical growing to do. Pound-for-pound one of the strongest players in the draft, Miller spent much of the year rounding out his game and furthering his education as a defenseman. It's only the third year Miller has been a defenseman after converting to the position as a sophomore in high school. The rapid development and the way he has grown into the position is a big reason I've got Miller as a top-20 caliber pick now. There's a lot of projecting going on here, as I think Miller still has a ways to go to ultimately become the pro I think he'll be. The physical strength is a nice attribute, but not as valuable in a teenage prospect as it will be down the line. I've seen improvement in his skating with good north-south speed and improved footwork. He has become more confident with the puck, making good passes and carrying it a little bit more. His confidence in jumping into plays still has a ways to go, but that's coming along, as well. His hand skills are pretty good for a bigger defenseman. His defending is also another area where I've seen remarkable improvement. Miller keeps a lot in front of him, uses his size to keep players to the outside and can lower the boom. Seeing how far he has come in three years has me especially intrigued by where he goes next in his development. The University of Wisconsin has been a factory for NHL defensemen over the years, so he'll be in a good spot to take the next step.","The dynamic two-way defender continued to display his full arsenal of weapons with Spokane this season. The former first overall pick in the 2015 WHL bantam draft, Smith is a tremendous skater who demonstrates poise and patience with the puck. His outlets are crisp and his head is always up. He's a player you fall in love with because he always makes the right play. Clicked at over a point-per-game this season. High ceiling and high floor –  What's not to like?",,,"A smallish blueliner,
Smith is an elite
skater, who, with his
dependable edgework and
heads-up approach, can skirt
and out of traffic, can zip in
and out of danger. Opponents
have recognized what a threat
he has become, with his feet,
with his hockey sense. He's
unpredictable, in a good way.
When not rushing the puck up
ice, he has the ability to find
teammates with an array of
short- and long-range passes.
From the point, he possesses
a snappy shot, with a quick
release. At this level, with his
excellent mobility and superb
touch, he can dominate
offensively. Defensively, Smith
is decent. Not exactly a wallbanger of a rearguard, he is
nevertheless not afraid to box
out opponents in front of the
net or steer them into the
boards. With physical maturity
will come more physical
punishment. He's crafty in all
three zones and his skating
allows him to aggressively
defuse enemy attacks. But he's
smart about gambling, which
says a lot about his hockey
sense, and his gap control is
excellent. Positionally, he is
sound. The first overall pick in
the 2015 WHL bantam draft,
he is a confident young man
who competes hard nightly
and exhibits exemplary
game management. Highly
regarded – and in the mould
of Duncan Keith – Smith shows
the promise to be a top-four
presence in the NHL. "
2018,C,72,173.9,18,CBJ,,Liam Foudy,"Foudy's season really took off in the second half of the season following London's trades, which elevated him to a premier role on the team. He's one of the best skaters in this draft class. Foudy, a former track star, can jet up the ice and put pressure on opponents by backing up defenders or closing on them on the forecheck. His skill level doesn't match his feet, but, as the season went on, he started to show more confidence making plays and can flash good puck skills. By spring, he was on the top power play unit for London and looked more comfortable trying to create offense. He has ok vision, but he won't be a premier playmaker as a pro. He has the potential to be a quality two-way forward who adds a dynamic speed element to your lineup.",,,"One of the biggest risers this draft season, Foudy really flourished once London traded away many of its star players. The lack of opportunity was undoubtedly holding Foudy back, but it's never a guarantee a player will respond when given the chance. Foudy, however, exploded. Once he got more ice time and got more confident in it, he became an offensive force. One of the most agile skaters in this draft class, Foudy attacks with speed, can take defenders wide and gets through the neutral zone in an awful hurry. He has the offensive sense to exploit gaps and enough puck skills to make plays in tight spaces. He averaged better than a point per game over the second half of the season after a very quiet first half. Sometimes players just need the opportunity to really showcase themselves. While you'd certainly prefer Foudy played well over the full 60-plus games of his season, understanding the context of his season makes most concerns fade away. One of the better overall athletes in this draft -- his dad was a CFL defensive back and his mother, France Gareau, is an Olympic silver medalist sprinter -- Foudy has a chance to sneak into the first round, but will provide exceptional value as an early second-rounder, too.",,,,"A speedy winger, he's
got quick feet and
enough acceleration
to get separation whenever
he needs it. And, if anything,
the Scarborough, Ont., native
is getting faster, and better
able to make sharp cuts. He's a
scoring threat every time he's
on the ice. A feisty presence,
he's not afraid to drive towards
the net with the puck. His
offensive game, already
substantial, grew game by
game during his draft season.
His smarts are really starting
to shine through and he's able
to adapt easier to what's in
front of him, on the fly. He's
incorporated new moves off
the rush and is now able to
do a number of things when
breaking in. And more than
just wheeling into enemy
territory, Foudy has the ability
to find lanes for passes or cycle
dangerously to create gaps in
the opposition's coverage. With
increased confidence, he is
displaying even more creativity
for puck distribution – such
as a no-look bank pass one
night – and shot selection. With
a quick and smooth release,
he can really zing the puck
and, wisely, tends to keep it
low. It's all part of his notable
offensive trajectory. On the
attack, he supports the play
and, when needed, can shield
the puck away from defenders.
As a lightning-fast skater with
quick hands, he's an effective
penalty-killer. Small, maybe,
but he maintains an elite work
ethic at all times."
2018,C,70.75,176.12,19,PHI,,Jay O'Brien,"O'Brien is the top prep prospect in this class and, throughout the season, has proven his worth be it at the All-American prospects game, at the USNTDP suiting up against USHL players or at the high school level. He's a skilled center who can make difficult offensive plays off the rush. He's confident with the puck and isn't afraid to hold it for an extra second. His skating has looked fine to me, but I've seen shifts where a slightly awkward stride can limit his explosiveness. O'Brien, to me, is more of a playmaker, but his finishing skills are competent for the pro level. He's a fierce competitor, who battles for pucks as hard as anyone in this class and is quite strong on the puck for a player who measures in at 5-foot-11.",,,"One of the more highly regarded players to come out of the U.S. prep or high school ranks this year, O'Brien elicits a wide range of opinions regarding his true upside. The prep players can be tougher to judge, especially one like O'Brien, who has a late-1999 birth date. He dominated while at Thayer, as expected, and also got some limited action with the U.S. National U18 team in some games against college teams and played in one USHL game with Youngstown. He has enough offensive talent to warrant a pick, but it's harder to just throw the stamp of approval on him given the many differing opinions. O'Brien's athleticism is a big part of what intrigues me about him, along with the fact that he's going to Providence College, where he's going to get some of the best coaching college hockey has to offer with Nate Leaman at the helm of the Friars.",Something of a hidden gem playing prep school hockey at Thayer Acadamy. Strong pivot who skates very well and is a tireless worker. He offers a nice upside. Transition to the NCAA next fall will be telling.,,,"An offensive centerman,
he's a strong skater who
can accelerate quickly
through the neutral zone.
His skating ability and his
edgework allow him to create
lots of time and space, making
him a very difficult player to
defend. It's amazing how open
he is able to get. To his credit,
even with his reputation, he
can still roam free, find the
dead areas of coverage, and
get good looks on net. He
always keeps his feet moving

a lot of penalties. He's always

handle duties at the point.
He owns a quick and strong
wristshot. Good release. He is
a leader, the kind of guy who
makes all the players around
him better. The biggest knock
on him is his size, but he has
enough skill to make up for
that deficiency. Not to mention
a commendable compete level.
He will battle in the corners and
along the boards regardless

2018,C,73.5,188.7,20,LAK,,Rasmus Kupari,"Kupari has shown very well at stages this season, such as with Finland's U18 team and with Finland's second division pro league, and as the season went along, he got a bigger role on an elite Liiga team. You can see there are a lot of tools to like in Kupari's game. He's a very strong skater, who explodes out of his first few strides and puts pressure on defenders using his speed. His stride is incredibly smooth, with so much power coming from every push off. I've heard some scouts call him a world-class skater; I'm not there yet, but he's close. Kupari also has high-end puck skills and can make skilled plays in tight and off the rush. I've seen flashes of good playmaking from him, but I don't think he's a high-end passer. Rather, I see Kupari more often as a very good north-south attacker who can make crafty plays with the puck or use his above-average shot. He needs time to round out his game, and to learn when to play quick and when to slow plays down, but his potential is among the very best in this draft class.","Kupari is all of the things the NHL is trending towards: Agile, up-tempo, crafty. I fear, though, that he was rushed into Liiga too early. He was completely ineffective for Karpat in the playoffs and gets caught playing on the outside. He has all of the tools to be a dynamic offensive threat, but it's going to take him some time. He needs to get stronger and learn to attack the middle of the ice more because he's lethal in and around the net when he gets there. He's also a deceptive, slick player whose tough to knock off the puck despite his thin frame, though.",,"An average-sized center, Kupari gets by on quickness and skill. He essentially played a third-line role for Karpat in Finland's top pro league this season. There were times when it appeared the pro game overwhelmed him, but he hit his stride in the latter half of the season and became a player the club didn't want to give up for the World U18 Championship. After Karpat was bounced, he was released, and made Finland better as they ended up winning the gold medal. He was a welcome addition, obviously.

""His skating is off the charts, and that's his biggest thing,"" said Niemela, the Finland coach. ""He brings a lot of speed to our team. He's in good condition, too."" That good conditioning allows Kupari to maintain a pretty consistent level, especially when playing for the national team. It's harder to establish that at the pro level. That said, there's a craftiness to his game on top of the speed. Kupari can play in a lot of different situations due to good hockey sense. He's still a bit of a tough player to gauge, as he could stand to be a little more dynamic, but he's got some solid offensive tools.",Cracked the WJC roster for the Fins and did well in a secondary role. He owns high-end playmaking ability that compliments his quick and elusive style. fast and creative hands can embarrass defenders. His smaller role with a top-level Liiga team limited his overall production. Has added substantial strength this season and it hasn't slowed him down.,"Slick Finnish forward, very dangerous with the puck on his stick, always a threat offensively",,"Decent-sized centerman,
he shows good overall
skating, with powerful
strides. His top speed is decent
and he's quite agile on his
skates. Helping matters, he
keeps his feet moving when
forechecking. With a long reach
and his ability to read the ice,
he showed that he is good
at pressuring puck carriers
and disrupting their flow,
even pickpocketing them on
occasion. But his strength is
offense. And scouts consider
him a catalyst in that regard.
That's his approach and he
was anticipating potential
passing lanes and frequently
he's able to position himself
for a quick transition. He's got
decent puckhandling skills and
was never afraid one-on-one
to challenge a defender. Also,
he's willing to skate the puck
to the net. Without the puck,
he's content to set up screens
at the crease's edge and get
into position for deflections. At
short range, he's got a deadly
touch. He's a natural at the
defensive side of the game.
When backchecking, he is
constantly on the hunt for a
man to pick up. Positionally, he
is very aware of his defensive
responsibilities, whether he's
playing the wing or center.
Committed as he is in his
own zone, he could stand to
upgrade his intensity and use
his body more to disrupt the
attackers, instead of only trying
to cut down passing lanes. But
there is plenty to like about
Kupari's game."
2018,D,71.25,167.5,21,SJS,,Ryan Merkley,"Merkley, a former No. 1 overall pick in his OHL draft class, is one of the most skilled players in the draft class and is one of the best passers I've ever seen at his age. He has the vision to attempt and execute plays most players don't think about and has the composure to move the puck at an elite level. When he's on his game, he makes everyone around him look better. He also shows a high level of skill. While he won't attempt end to end rushes like Ryan Murphy used to all the time in the OHL, Merkley can make a highlight reel skill play to open up space for his vision. He skates very well, but he's more of an elusive skater with great edge work than a guy who blazes through the neutral zone, though he does possess above-average speed. He uses his footwork and edges to create space and looks for options. Now for his warts. Merkley is small, can be a headache defensively with some of his decisions, coverage and physicality — although I've seen him lay out a huge hit here and there. He has severe up and downs, where he looks dominant one game and can be a major negative another, as well as he can let his emotions get the best of him.","Concerns about Merkley are well known. He's got a temper, is easily frustrated, and was sent home at least once this season. There is chatter that he's a bad teammate/uncoachable. He's also one of the most purely gifted playmaking defencemen not named Rasmus Dahlin that we've seen in recent years. None of Timothy Liljegren, Erik Brannstrom or even Cale Makar had his kind of creativity in 2017. Nor did Olli Juolevi, Mikhail Sergachev or Charlie McAvoy in 2016. He finds players you aren't supposed to find and he's so light on his edges that he effortlessly changes directions with the puck. While he's soft in his own zone and needs to get a lot stronger, he has shown some positive signs in best-on-best situations — when he's not playing on a subpar Guelph team — and that he can hold his own when he wants to. He still takes too many risks, but his skating allows him to smoothly get back in transition and a little bit of strength would go a long way. He's the most high-risk prospect in the draft and will appear on a lot of teams' no-draft lists but I couldn't justify taking any player outside of my top-16 ahead of him. He's also the second-youngest player I have ranked in the first round (to Boqvist by one day) so some of it could well be chalked up to maturity.",,"Merkley is an absolute lightning rod. The conversation about him throughout the year has been largely negative among scouts and others around junior hockey. Most agree he has elite offensive skills, but his lack of detail defensively and character concerns have dropped him on many boards, and off others entirely. Multiple teams will not draft him regardless of how far he falls, while others might be a little more willing in the late rounds. There also could be a team out there laying low that decides to jump in and take him in the first. The scouting world can be pretty gossipy, and it can be hard to cut through rumor to get to reality, but there's enough smoke here to give me pause.

All of that aside, Merkley is one of the best passers in this draft, possessing elite vision and some of the best hands of any defenseman available. Defensively, he's not much to write home about, though I did manage to see one of his better defensive performances live, which tells me he can do the job when he's engaged. And that's where scouts' concern about off-ice stuff is trumped by the on-ice. Not knowing what you're going to get from one game to the next is a very real concern. Additionally, he's only 17, and you can't necessarily project how a player is going to mature and evolve. There is no question that Merkley is a high-risk pick, but I still feel like there could be reward for a team that's willing to take the leap and to have the patience to work with the player. Merkley has to convince teams that he's willing to put the work in, too. My guess at this point is Merkley will not go in the first, but a team with a stockpile of picks that feels it can assume the risk will give him a shot.","One of the youngest players in this draft, he's also one of the most offensively gifted (and enigmatic). The reigning OHL Rookie of the Year boasts elite offensive skills from the back end: Vision, passing, dynamic edges, good top end speed, and impressive acceleration. His play in his own zone and decision-making without the puck are still very much a work in progress. Couple that with whispers of attitude issues and we may see him slide considerably on draft day. However, the right-handed defender has the makings of a dynamic point-producer if he hits. His boom or bust tag has been well earned.",,,"A top-flight rearguard
and a dynamic skater,
he has quick and agile
feet and is often eager to
rush the puck. His speed can
make defenders look like
beer-leaguers and it allows
him to create offense out of
nothing. When trapped in a
corner, say, he can burst loose
with fancy footwork and quick
hands. To distribute the puck,
though, he can toss beautiful
breakout and stretch passes,
a ploy that works well given
how much checking attention
he receives. Eyes are always on
him, which makes it easier for
him to find wide-open mates,
especially in the neutral zone.
When he plays a more team
 focused brand of hockey, his
smarts and offensive skills
are even more evident. It also
helps cut down on his highrisk sequences when he gets
caught trying to do too much.
He has a bad habit of trying
to be cute – too cute – and it
can be costly. More than once,
Guelph has been burned by
his unforced turnovers. In all
three zones, he can be careless.
However, slowly but steadily,
he's building some trust into
his game. His bread and butter
– elite skating – helps him in
the defensive zone, too, to
get into position quickly, to
challenge the attackers. There
is lots of upside here, especially
if Merkley's game continues
to mature, particularly the
decision-making aspects. He
does, however, possess bust
potential."

He's a great athlete. He's 6-foot-3, 200 pounds, and is one of the better skating defensemen in the entire draft. Miller is also a high-character workhorse who flies up and down the ice. He's incredibly tough on his checks in battles, and with his great closing speed, he gets in guys faces quickly. With his speed, he's able to jump up into the attack. Despite being a converted forward, my major question on him is how high his offensive ceiling is. I've seen enough flashes from him that I think there's something there, like the odd great pass or rush, but he's not very consistent in that regard right now.",,,,"Converted to the backend just a few seasons ago, the offensively-inclined defender demonstrates tremendous skating ability for his size.

deep. Miller plays his position
with a tonne of confidence.
Thanks for his strength
and skating ability, he can
control intruding attackers.
He keeps his gaps tight and,
when necessary, can step
up to his man to take away
space or unleash a punishing
bodycheck. Along the boards,
he is very aggressive and in
front of the net he's very good
at clearing out bodies. At times,
he looks like a man amongst
boys. High-end hockey sense
leads to effectiveness, even if
he's not overly flashy in how he
goes about his business. Lateral
agility and puck skill and
deception allow him to create
lanes for a quick shot on net
– scouts say he has a bomb of
a slapper – or a hard, accurate
pass to a teammate. Decent
hands, he'll probably never be
an offensive dynamo but he
can cover the basics when he's
helping join in on the attack.
Plenty of physical tools on
display for the Hopkins, Minn.,
native to go with his superb
hockey sense. A top-notch
prospect"
2018,C,72.25,183.16,23,ANA,,Isac Lundestrom,"Lundestrom has been an important part of his SHL team as an 18-year-old, playing a lot of minutes and making plays in both ends of the rink. He's a well-rounded pivot who can drive play for his team. Lundestrom's IQ stands out to me frequently. At the pro level, he's shown no signs of the pace being too quick for him, as he makes good plays at a fast speed. He works hard, is strong on pucks down low and gets back on defense but doesn't look to engage physically at times. With the puck on his stick, he can make a skilled play and shows above-average vision with flashes of high-end. He's a strong skater and I've seen him put defenders on their heels with his speed. His ability to be a playmaker as well as a primary defensive center for whatever team he's on speaks volumes to his abilities. He doesn't have the skills to take over a shift, but he's a nice do-it-all type of player.","Lundestrom, like Kotkaniemi, is another player whose whole is more than the sum of his parts — and who I'm higher on than most. After Dahlin and Canucks prospect Elias Petterson, I'd argue Lundestrom, Vegas prospect Lukas Elvenes, and Sabres draftee Marcus Davidsson rounded out the SHL's five best young players this season. Like Tkachuk, he has always played above his age class and thus has never really been able to dominate his peers. That makes him harder to evaluate, but I believe he would have been Sweden's most dangerous offensive threat had he played at U18s. He anticipates the play at an extremely high level, is strong on draws, and makes things happen away from the puck by recognizing when the play has broken down defensively and filling in the gaps. I think he'll play a big role in everything that Lulea does next season and I expect he'll be a centre, not a winger, in the NHL.",,"At only 18 years old, Lundestrom has spent two full seasons in the SHL with Lulea. He showed considerable progression this season, both offensively and from an overall maturity standpoint. He could be relied upon more, playing a top-six role, which allowed him more chances to produce. Additionally, Lundestrom has a commitment to defense, with the added ability of being able to quickly transition. He's a good skater with some power elements in his game thanks to a sturdy frame and strong legs. While at the World Junior Championship, Sweden often started with Lundestrom's line to set the tone for the period with their speed and willingness to get in on the forecheck aggressively. He's likely to end up more of a middle-six player who can provide scoring depth and take on some tough matchups, but I don't think he's all that far away from being an NHL-caliber forward.","Skilled puck-distributor has shown very well as a draft-eligible player in the SHL – his second year in Sweden's top league. His skill is unspectacular, but the nuances to his game are terrific. He's the type of player you like the more you watch him. In a centre-lite draft, his stock has risen. Saw his role expand in the WJC and thrived with more ice.",Powerful skater.. ability to carry the puck deep using good puck protection on both sides to then put dangerous pucks in front from down low,,"The centerman skates
well, with speed and
mobility and balance.
He's a heady player and can
produce offensively. Even
without the puck and away
from the play, he's engaged
in the play, actively seeking
open lanes to become
accessible to his linemates.
When appropriate. Lundestrom
would head for the net
and look for rebounds and
deflections. He's got a nice flair
for offense, whether he's one timing a shot or supporting
teammates in enemy territory.
Impressive decision-making
with the puck. Quick hands.
His release is admirable,
but his shot could use an
improvement in accuracy and
power. He shows nice vision,
with a real awareness of his
linemates. Calm, but not afraid
to grab the puck in the neutral
zone and take over. He uses his
body to shield the puck from
opponents. Defensively, he's
smart and willingly shoulders
a lot of responsible. With his
high level of anticipation, he
is able to intercept passes and
take possession of loose pucks.
He's not the most physical
player, but he doesn't run from
contact. Not afraid to take a
hit or make a hit. Willing to
run plays in traffic if necessary.
A strong understanding of
hockey, particularly team play,
he offers a mature style of play.
Confident in all aspects – and
all zones – of the game, he
displays a commendable workrate. "
2018,D,72.75,175.62,24,MIN,,Filip Johansson,,,,,,,,"A defensive blue-liner, his
skating is really smooth
and it looks like he's
flowing around the ice, even
though he's a decent-sized guy.
He's not the fastest skater, but
he makes up for it with clever
positioning. An own-zone ace,
he starts many of his shifts in
the defensive zone – in other
words, coaches trust him.
He reads the game well, and
that allows him to steal pucks
from opposing players. He's a
capable shot-blocker. Also, he
likes to push and shove in front
of his own net. Goaltenders
certainly appreciate that. He
definitely does not shy away
from the rough stuff. It doesn't
matter how big the opposing
player is, he still does whatever
he can to keep him away from
his net. He is hard for opposing
players to get around. An
excellent defender in that
sense. He uses his long stick to
pressure and he can close gaps
physically. He makes few errors
in his own zone. He excels at
killing penalties. He tries to
create offensive opportunities
occasionally. Even with the
puck on his stick, he continues
to be a great skater, keeping
his head up in order to find
the right passing lane. A nice
mover of the puck, he can
make plays under pressure.
Patient in determining the
proper play. His wrist shot,
according to one scout, is quick
and silent – not very hard. But
he is mobile out there, plays
simple. A very capable threezone player."
2018,RW,73,176,25,STL,,Dominik Bokk,"Bokk is one of the most interesting players for me in this draft class. I watched him about as much as any prospect, going though about half his games this season. Every game I saw of him, there were 1 or 2 instances that left you marveled.  He shows you glimpses of elite talent and someone who can be an impact winger. Bokk's pure puck skill is up there with the very best in the draft class. He dances with the puck on his stick and can make flashy dekes seem routine. His hands also translate to making him one of the best pick pockets (of pucks) I've seen at his age.  He's a good playmaker who looks to makes plays to his teammates and has the patience and skill to hold the puck and let an option develop. He can finish chances, too, and when he's played internationally, the German team has looked to him as a trigger man. His skating is fine, not explosive, but average. The main criticism of him is off the puck. He's not a very intense physical player nor is he great defensively. His production hasn't been amazing this season in Sweden's junior circuit, but he didn't play much high-level hockey until 17, so his game needs some maturing. I rank him this high despite low production because of his immense talent, no character flags, and I could see his development spiking as he continues to play high-level hockey.","Bokk is a big kid with room still to grow. He is so deceptive that he plays like he's smaller than he is. He's extremely poised with the puck and one of the better skaters in the class, which made him an offensive forced in SuperElit. Still, while he's an explosive threat, the rest of his game lacks: He nearly never engages physically without the puck and tends to reach with his stick instead; he coasts back in transition; he doesn't fully pursue loose pucks; and he's easily frustrated with his teammates. If he can sort those things out, he's got second-line NHL upside. We'll see. There's no question he's a first-round talent.",,"I've been up and down on Bokk this season, as I believe he definitely has high-end puck skills. There's a lot of dynamism to his game, which you don't often find in German players. He had a strong season in Sweden's U20 ranks and even got some reps with Swedish champion Vaxjo in the SHL this season. He got pretty significant playing time when he was up, though he only ended up with a goal and an assist. That's all great experience for the 17-year-old regardless of how he produced. His passing ability is up there with some of the best players in this draft. He can make defenders miss, and his poise with the puck is pretty solid. He has a good shot, too, but I think he's more of a pass-first guy, and it suits him.

What I'm curious about is how Bokk will do in the tougher games. He had a lot of time and space this year in the U20 ranks and thrived. The pro game showed that he still has a ways to go in terms of making plays under pressure and being behind some of his peers physically. Of the players I have in this range on my board, Bokk probably has the highest upside, which is why I would not be surprised to see him go higher than I have him.","Agile, quick hands, elusive in the offensive zone and makes a habit of landing on the scoresheet. Big-time J20 season and received a cup of coffee in the SHL. He's just getting started after transitioning from the German league where the quality of competition wasn't high enough. If you like high-octane skill, you'll love Bokk.","a highly talented winger with one on one ability, quick hands, and creative passing. Can challenge goalies with his shot, too",,"With his skillset, he is
a threat every time he
suits up. His skating,
according to one scout, is
world class. Above-average
acceleration with his quick first
steps. And with the puck, he
exhibits tremendous poise. His
stickhandling is tremendous, as
is his vision with the puck. He
is a natural passer. Even under
pressure, he thread passes to
teammates. His shot is strong.
In fact, he could stand to use
it more instead of first looking
to make a passing play to a
teammate. Working one-onone, he's got the tools to be
successful, even at top speed.
If his high-tempo pace and
snappy passes prove to be too
much for teammates, he's been
known to slam his stick on the
ice in frustration, then coast
slowly back to the bench. His
body language can be poor.
If he demands the puck and
doesn't get it, he's been seen
cussing out guilty linemates
on the ice. Physically, he can be
nonchalant, preferring to try to
poke-check the puck instead
of stepping into his man. His
work rate in his own end and
without the puck is not good.
Defensively, there are flaws in
Bokk's game. Sometimes, he
doesn't go the extra mile to win
races into the defensive zone.
He's brushed up his work ethic,
but, at times, he can appear
lazy in his responsibilities.
A standout, but only when
he wants to be. Definitely, a
high-risk/high-reward type of
prospect."
2018,D,72.25,186.8,26,OTT,,Jacob Bernard-Docker,"Bernard-Docker was very good in the AJHL and was named the top defenseman in that league and in the entire CJHL. Despite his great numbers, I wouldn't describe him as a dynamic offensive defenseman, but he does a lot well around the puck. JDB moves the puck well. He's very smart and composed making clean zone exits. His skill is solid too, and he can evade a check or two with his decent feet and hands to create space. When his team is on the attack, he's not afraid to jump in, and he has a big point shot too. He's got a decent physical game and, while he could get better defensively, he's hard on his checks and is reasonably smart in his own end.",,,"There's been some debate about whether Jonny Tychonick or Bernard-Docker is the better player. Tychonick is a bit more sure-handed with the puck, but Bernard-Docker is an excellent trigger man with a heavy shot from the point. His 20-goal mark is the highest total by a U18 defenseman in the AJHL over the last 20 seasons. While he posted strong numbers offensively, he's not an exceptional puck mover, but he has enough skill to suggest a higher upside. Bernard-Docker was initially slated to attend the University of North Dakota in 2019-20, but he performed so well this season that he's going to be headed to campus this fall. I think he's going to be a stellar college defenseman on his way to becoming a very good pro prospect.",,,,"A two-way defender, he
plays bigger than his
modest dimensions,
showing upper- and lowerbody strength. His mobility
is an asset. He's strong on his
skates and possesses a very
fluid stride, switching gears
and accelerating with ease.
A dynamic first stride in any
direction. Calm when pursued,
he can make confident turns
and crossovers, which creates a
tonne of holes for teammates.
Able to smoothly transition
from skating backwards to
forwards. His wheels permit
him to play a very assertive
game, even in the neutral zone.
His gap control is good and he
makes smart plays. He's very
calculated and has earned the
complete trust of his coaches.
He knows when to skate a puck
to safety, when to pass it, when
to dump it. Positioning in his
own zone is sound, although
sometimes he appears to be
guessing out there. Another
drawback, according to scouts,
is that he's not very dynamic.
He's responsible and safe,
but there's no flashy passing
or high-end stickwork. His
creativity on the power play
left a bit to be desired. Needs
to be a little craftier, especially
if he wants to get his shot off.
However, he did manage to
score 20 times this season.
A dream prospect for future
coaches, though. A workhorse

the University of North Dakota.
Highly intelligent, highly
mobile."
2018,D,70.75,172.34,27,CHI,,Nicolas Beaudin,"Beaudin has been a top producing defenseman in the QMJHL the past few years and a key player for Drummondville, one of the best teams in the QMJHL this past season. The first thing that stands out about Beaudin is his hockey sense. He's a very composed and aware defender with the puck who makes plays with pace and displays quality vision. He makes a ton of good decisions, not showing much panic in his game and was a quarterback for a power play filled with talented players. He's not a super flashy puck rusher and, although his skating and hands are fine, I wouldn't call him a dynamic player. Despite that, he was still an excellent power play QB and projects to be so as a pro. His IQ allows him to be OK defensively at the junior level, although given he's a smaller defenseman and lacks elite mobility, he'll need to get a lot stronger to defend at the higher levels.",,,"Beaudin has been a major riser after leading Drummondville in scoring with 69 points this season. He continued his high production in the playoffs, showcasing excellent mobility and quickness. Beaudin's defensive game needs work, as he's at a bit of a disadvantage due to his size. That said, he does a lot of things well when he has the puck on his stick, making quick decisions and making himself a threat the other team has to be aware of. Anyone who moves the puck as well as Beaudin is going to give himself a good chance of reaching the next level.","Swift, play-creating defender put up a bushel of points in the QMJHL this past season. Failed to generate the same level of buzz as Noah Dobson due to his size and lack of elite two-way play, but Beaudin knows how to produce. Likely destined for a somewhat sheltered role but can help a team generate on the PP","Nicolas Beaudin is a diminutive yet cunning defenceman that is able to use his size to his advantage. His mobility is all but elite at this point; he primarily uses his speed to open up passing and shooting lanes in the offensive zone. With and without the puck he stays composed and in-position, allowing him to analyze situations effortlessly and make those calculated decisions. Defensively, he is assertive and, though he isn't able to impose himself physically, he uses his vision and quickness to take away options and put pressure on the opposition. He plays a structured game offensively, and he does the little things right. His ability to recognize where the puck is, where it is going to be, and why it is going to be there is an indicator of his high-level hockey sense. When you put together skill, speed, and excellent decision-making as well as he does, that translates to on-ice productivity and power-play time. All-in-all, Nicolas Beaudin is an offensive defenceman that understands his own game well and ever seeks to expand upon his strengths.",,"An offensive rearguard,

buy himself separation. But
with decent footwork, he is

pick his spots since he doesn't
have the speed to recover

overly flashy, but he's steady –
he can be relied upon to make

2018,D,71.25,172.94,28,NYR,,Nils Lundkvist,"Lundkvist was a riser this season in part due to a growth spurt, no pun intended. Who am I kidding, pun intended. After never playing for Sweden internationally, he became one of the more important players for their U18 team, was named the top defenseman in Sweden's junior circuit and at times was playing top-four minutes in the SHL for Lulea. He finds himself on this list due to the fact there isn't a ton of upside in his game due to his size and talent level. He's not a very flashy player, but he's very smooth. He can skate pucks up the ice or out of trouble, but he's more comfortable just making a good pass. He's not a basic player and can hold onto pucks for a few more seconds to wait out options. I don't think he has a ton of skill, though, in terms of being able to dominate a shift or create a chance without help. Defensively, he's solid despite his size. He closes on guys well, makes good decisions and can win a few battles.",,,"He's been overshadowed quite a bit by the other Swedish defensemen in his age group, but Lundkvist has many fans in the scouting community. He split his season between Lulea's pro and U20 teams, and looked good for both. He also was a standout player for Sweden at the U18 level internationally. What jumps out to me about Lundkvist is that he's not very big, but he's a very good defender. He's smart in the way he takes players off the puck and gets in the way really well, closing gaps quickly and identifying opportunities when the opposing player is vulnerable. On top of that, he has really good passing skills and can help his team get the puck up and out after he gets it. The hockey sense is a big factor in Lundkvist shooting up my board, but I also think he's just starting to get a handle on how to bring more of his offensive capabilities to the forefront to make him more of a two-way threat.","Smooth skating, right-shot defender who has looked comfortable and calm in the SHL as a 17-year-old. Can run a power play, jump of the ice to join the attack and offers reliable positioning in the defensive end. Had a strong Five Nations tournament and has looked capable again at the U18's. Has been making a charge up the rankings for many.",mobile puck-moving defenseman who likes to make quick decisions and join the rush. Lundkvist displays confidence with the puck on his stick,,"An offensively motivated

up speed. A great and heady

undersized, he's not afraid to
commit to a physical brand,
playing very aggressively
along the boards. Competes
hard all night long and will
dish out hits. That said, he can
be a risky presence. He tries
to get stuff done offensively –
sometimes to his detriment. At
times, he can drift away from
his defensive positioning and
lose track of the opposition.
Not helping matters, he's
been known to try to do too
much with his first pass, which
is typically strong and and
active. In his hunger to do
more offensively, he can get
caught flat-footed. His shot is
okay and he likes to jump into

Sandin's best trait is his hockey sense. He's a very smart puck-moving defenseman. He can see the ice at a high level on outlets, but also up on the attack, hitting tight seams and creating chances with his passes, which occasionally rise to the level of remarkable. His skating is decent, but he lacks an explosive gear, especially for a smaller defender. Despite average speed and just fine hands, he is still quite elusive with the puck and is able to spin off pressure fine. Sandin is small, but he's a tough competitor and has been the captain for his Sweden age group for the past few years. He's solid defensively despite his size, with fine gap control, and wins his fair share of battles. I wonder if he's not dynamic enough at his size to be an impact guy, but he's trending very well.",,,"I didn't see much of Sandin coming into this season beyond his Ivan Hlinka performance last summer, but having seen him live a few times now and on video more, he has grown on me in a big way. Despite being average sized, he is an awfully sturdy and strong player. He's hard to beat in battles and isn't afraid to be physical defensively. Sandin keeps things relatively simple offensively, not showing a ton of dynamic elements. Still, he's effective as a passer and carries a confident presence on the offensive blue line. He played a pretty prominent role on one of junior hockey's best teams this season and managed to make the Soo Greyhounds better. I think some teams may exercise caution because of the size factor, but I also think Sandin is mobile and smart enough to overcome those concerns.",Transition defender who offers strong vision and crisp passes.

smart defender, he
also possesses some
pretty slick moves, incredible
patience, and elite smarts in

though, is not a strength
and, occasionally, players can
get around him along the
boards. But he is an excellent
backchecker and, with his
hockey IQ, can anticipate
the attackers' next moves.
Sometimes, he pulls himself
out of position looking for a big
hit or he allows too much gap
to incoming forward, losing
the proper angle for a check.
His smart quick stick, however,
is plenty disruptive. In enemy
territory, he is dynamite, with
slick hands and elite vision.
Head up, he never hesitates on
the blue line. Making calculated
decisions, he is always looking
to move the puck into more
dangerous areas. On the blue
line, he gives the opposition fits
because he can deke or dish or
let fly with a slapper. His shot
isn't particularly heavy, but it's
accurate with decent velocity,
and he never forces it. His
patience with the puck forces
opponents to make poorly
timed checking decisions.
Confidently, he uses a head
fake and his sharp edges to
buy himself and his teammates
more time. Frequently, he
joins the rush, giving his team

2018,C,73.25,194,30,DET,,Joe Veleno,"Veleno is the first player to be given exceptional status to play in the QMJHL as a 15-year-old. His production took off after a midseason trade to Drummondville from Saint John, but he's always been considered one of the best players in his age group. He is an excellent skater — particularly for a 6-foot-1 forward — and he gets up to top speed quite easily with a powerful stride. Veleno works hard and plays a powerful style on the puck without taking many bad penalties. I don't think he's a dynamic playmaker, but he's certainly above-average with the puck and can flash a tier higher. I like his puck skills, he's a very smart player and he can consistently make above-average plays. Can he take a game over? That's the million dollar question with Veleno. There are moments where you watch him and think the answer is maybe, but more likely he'll just be an above-average skill guy.  While his shot/finishing ability is a bit worrying, Veleno has the speed, skills, smarts and physicality to be a very good playmaker and zone entry artist as an NHLer combined with being a reliable two-way center. That has a lot of value.","Veleno is one of the best skaters in the class, not only at his top speed, but, more importantly, in the way he accelerates and changes pace with the puck — which allows him to control and dictate tempo. He backs defenders off, stops up and finds the trailer in the slot as well as anyone in this draft. I'd still like to see him shoot more and be more aggressive in attacking the low slot with possession when he has the step on a defenceman, but he doesn't have a heavy shot. He's a pass-first centre who is extremely committed to the defensive zone, uses his feet to be the first man back, wins races for loose pucks, and works hard to play within his team's systems. I don't think he has first line upside, but he can be the passer on my team's top PP unit and a contributing, detail freak, checking centre who can play up and down the lineup on my team any day.",,"The best way to describe Veleno is probably ""well-rounded."" He's not truly elite at any one thing, but he's effective in all zones, strong on the puck and committed to playing strong defensively. Veleno's offensive skills are also strong, highlighted primarily by quick hands and some shiftiness. He also protects the puck with a strong frame and powerful skating. For as skilled as Veleno is, he has a strong defensive work ethic. I think one of the biggest questions surrounding Veleno is his year-to-year progression after being granted exceptional status to enter the QMJHL a year early. He hasn't taken remarkably big steps forward as a player, which makes me wonder about his overall upside. That said, the level he's playing at now as a center and the versatility he brings to the table are why I still have him a bit higher. The last four players to be granted that exceptional status were John Tavares, Aaron Ekblad, McDavid and Sean Day, and three of them went No. 1 overall in the NHL draft.","A jack-of-all-trades player with a nice tool belt. Great edgework, acceleration, vision and puck-protection skills. Blazing fast in a straight line. The 18-year-old is already a consummate worker in the defensive end and is a very safe selection as he has a pro-level approach. One of the best power play distributors in the QMJHL.","There is so much to like about Joe Veleno. He's a hard-nosed workhorse that makes the players around him better. The fleet-footed center is unselfish and will primarily look to make a play at top speed; however, when the chance arises to put it in the pot himself, he will capitalize. He sees the ice well and is rarely caught out of position. His defensive game is refined and he actively pursues puck control. Transitioning to offence is natural, smooth, and quick. All-in-all, a well-rounded two-way forward that skates well and can be the catalyst a team needs to turn a game in its favor. If he can find the consistency in refusing to let himself get taken out of plays, especially if he doesn't start them, he will thrive and exceed expectations.",,"A terrific centerman, he
is a great skater, with
high-end top speed and
extremely good mobility. He
skates low with a wide stance,
just like Sidney Crosby. His
first steps and acceleration
are breathtaking – not to
mention one of his top assets.
He can change pace, he can
change directions, and he owns
tremendous puckhandling
skills. He's able to hold onto
the puck at top speed with
his head up. He protects the
puck very well with his body
and he can get into shooting
position using his strong legs.
He is incredibly smart, with
and without the puck, and
he knows how to feed his
teammates. Flashy, with an
impressive shot. In tight space,
he is an elite presence. Working
in one-on-one battles, his quick
hands allow him to take hold
of the puck more often than
not. Lots of speed, lots of skill,
to go with a very high compete
level. He's visible on every shift
and involved in everything
on the ice. Even defensively,
his work rate stands out. He
forechecks and backchecks
very hard. With a big hit or
using his quick hands, he can
often steal the puck. He never
misses an opportunity to
throw a bodycheck, although
sometimes he crosses the line
with hits from behind and
boarding. Veleno is even good
on the penalty kill. Blocks shots,
too. Opportunities to grow as
a leader for this ‘exceptional'
QMJHL standout."
2018,D,75.75,195.5,31,WSH,,Alexander Alexeyev,"Alexeyev had a strong second WHL season, moving my impression of him as an NHL prospect from fringe at this point last season to a real player. He's not a game breaker, but he has a lot of positive elements. He stands in at 6-foot-3, 200 pounds, skates well for a big defenseman, and can handle the puck fine. He has a real calmness to his game in how he moves the puck. It's that poise with the puck and his IQ that leads me to think he has a chance to be a top-four defenseman despite not having dynamic speed/skill. I don't think that projection is a lock, as I have some questions about if his offense in the WHL will translate to the NHL, but he made enough plays this season to get on my radar. Alexeyev is solid defensively, too, using his strength and frame to win battles, and showing good positional play. Alexeyev was a top player for Red Deer despite dealing with significant personal tragedy, as his mother passed away suddenly in the middle of the season.",,,"A big, calculating defenseman, Alexeyev is good at keeping the game in front of him. He moves the puck very well and has a pretty good shot from the point when he leans into it. His big frame makes him tough to beat, but I do have some concern about his skating. His footwork is pretty good in that he's able to establish position on the rush, but as the speed of the game picks up, I'm wondering if he'll be able to keep up with it. As the season progressed in Red Deer, I think he progressed with it, which is why I'm more encouraged by where he's headed as a prospect. He might not be a dynamic player, but he does a lot of little things well, which is why I think he's got a better chance of continuing on this encouraging development arc.","Powerful left-shot defender plays a throw-back style with new-age mobility. Offers a big shot from the point, a long, fluid stride, and a physical edge. Projects as a strong middle pairing player.",,,"A productive blueliner,
he is a strong skater,
even though he is lanky
and looks awkward at times
in his stride. He can accelerate
and generate pretty good
speed. For a big player, he is
very strong on his edges. His
lateral mobility is good and
he pivots well. Defensively,
he reads situations at a high
level, having no issues with
gaps and retrievals. Quick
with his stick, he sticks to a
low-risk game in his own zone.
Definitely not afraid to throw
his body around to disrupt the
opposition. He is well-rounded
enough to be deployed in
all situations. He has great
awareness with the puck,
which he moves extremely
well. He is a deceptive
playmaker, who uses fakes and
strong edgework to peel away
from opponent and open up
passing lanes. Breaking out, he
is able to withstand pressure
and physicality. He has a strong
presence in the offensive line
and he isn't afraid to jump in to
support his teammates, given
the Rebels a boost. He has a
heavy shot, but his preference
is to look first at passing the
puck. He could find a way
to inject some energy into
his game. The overall tempo
of his game, at times, leaves
something to be desired. One
of the problems, according
to scouts, is that Alexeyev,
riddled by injuries, played only
86 games over the past two
seasons. Lots of tools at his
disposal."
2018,D,76,218.36,32,BUF,,Mattias Samuelsson,"Samuelsson was the tough-minutes defenseman for the USNTDP this season, wearing the ‘C' and being leaned on to shut down the opponent's top players every night. He's a big, tough, strong defenseman who skates well for his size and works his butt off. Samuelsson is willing to sacrifice his body and battle hard every shift. He's a smart defender, he gets in good spots to make defensive plays and he has enough vision to get the transition game going. With Samuelsson there is a question of how much of an impact he can make, as he does have a safe player feel to him. His skill level is subpar. At times, the NTDP used him on the power play and, when they did, he relied on his IQ to move the puck. With that said, I have questions about if his offense translates to a higher level.",,,"A bruising, physical defenseman with NHL bloodlines -- former NHLer Kjell Samuelsson is his father -- Samuelsson had a bit of an up-and-down season. I didn't think he performed overly well at the World U18 Championship compared with his high standard of play previously, but he played a ton. Used more as a shutdown defenseman, his tools in his own end are definitely superior to his offensive abilities. That said, the maturity he displays is a reason some scouts I've talked to see him as not needing as much time before he can make the jump to the NHL. He is currently slated to attend Western Michigan University to play for former NHL head coach Andy Murray, who has developed his share of quality defenders.

The big question with Samuelsson at this point is how high is his ceiling? He's already bigger and stronger than many of his peers, but does he have another gear to get to offensively? I saw enough this season to suggest that he has more to give there. He's got a very good shot when he uses it; he just needs to use it more. Plus, he moves the puck better than he is often given credit for. But I think there are valid concerns about his ability to produce from the back end at the next level. Regardless, he still has a lot of tools that could make him an NHL defenseman for a long, long time, and I still view him as a likely top-four defender long term.",,,,"Another product of the U.S. National Development Team, this is one big blue-liner. Not particularly flashy, Samuelsson is an effective two-way player. Even though top-end speed is not his forte, his skating is good enough once he gets going to allow him to keep pace with play. His asset, not surprisingly, is his shut-down work. Using his stick or his body, no matter how much traffic and commotion, he can alleviate pressure. Willing to sacrifice to keep pucks out of his net. But he's not all defence. He possesses got hockey sense and vision, meaning he is able to make strong choices moving the puck or putting it on net. To go with his over-sized dimensions, the Voorhees, N.J., native is also a character presence. A leader for the U.S. squad for whom he collected 14 points and 64 penalty minutes in 23 appearances. In 2016-17, a season split between the U-17 and U-18 sides, Samuelsson managed 10 points in 30 outings. Plenty of upside on display here."
2018,RW,71,185,33,DET,,Jonatan Berggren,"Berggren has been a favorite of mine whenever I've watched him this season in Sweden or international play. He put up fantastic numbers in Sweden's top junior circuit. He's not a big guy or a player with elite skill, but he makes a difference every game. As the season went on with Sweden's U18 team his role continued to grow until he was eventually their top forward. His skating is good as he often shows the ability to beat defenders wide with speed and can change speeds very well. His hands are also impressive. You'd like to see a little more creativity from a forward his size who will make his living scoring, but he can make defenders miss. I like his vision a lot. He's always looking to make a play and seems to have eyes in the back of his head. What I also like about his game is the pace he plays with. He's always attacking, hitting the zone with speed and doesn't make plays from a standstill. He shows good shiftiness on his edges trying to create space for his vision. Berggren also has the hustle you like to see in a smaller player and can play on both special teams.","I have been really high on Berggren all year. When I had him at No. 43 on my midseason list, several scouts asked me why. Most now have him as a second- or third-rounder. They see a smaller, perimeter player who has yet to find his footing in the SHL. I see a small kid who dominated SuperElit in almost historic ways and was only rewarded with seven minutes a night during a short 10-game stint with a very good team. Berggren has grown on me all year. He was unstoppable against his peers in junior and followed it up with an outstanding showing at U18s. He's also a July birthday, and his 1.5-points-per-game clip put him in historic company as one of the highest scoring under-18 players in the history of Sweden's top junior league alongside Lias Andersson and Jesper Boqvist and ahead of William Karlsson and Lars Eller. He hasn't committed to where he's going to play next season, but he's the kind of player who could benefit from playing in the CHL if he's taken in the import draft. He's fun to watch in open ice.",,"Another player who has really jumped out to me over the course of the year, Berggren is one of the more dynamic players still on the board in this range and a personal favorite of mine this draft season. He led Sweden's top junior league with 57 points this season, posting the fourth-best season ever by a U18 player in that league. His scoring rates compare favorably with last year's No. 7 pick Lias Andersson and exceeds those of Stanley Cup finalists Lars Eller and William Karlsson at the same age. Berggren also saw some time in the pro ranks with Skelleftea and even appeared in two playoff games. He followed that up with an especially strong performance for Sweden at the World U18 Championship, leading the team with 10 points. In pretty much all of my viewings this year, Berggren stood out as a higher-end skill player who can get by defenders and create chances for himself and his teammates.","An absolute wrecking ball of a player who has been posting tremendous numbers in the Swedish J20 circuit. Logs miles of ice as he forechecks with impunity; distributes the puck effectively and knows how to finish as well. Terrific international performances at the Hlinka, Five Nations and U18's offer scouts a glimpse of his skill on some big stages. He even looked capable in a 12-game stint in the SHL. Some of the best one-on-one skills in the class. A player his coaches love and his opponents hate.",,,
2018,RW,77,203.5,34,FLA,,Serron Noel,"Noel has a unique combination of abilities in this draft. He's one of the best athletes in this draft. He tailed off a bit in the second half after opening eyes in the fall, but he's a 6-foot-5 forward who skates and handles the puck well, which for a player at his size is quite unique. He's opened my eyes quite often, as you normally don't see a giant like him as a 17-year-old be able to glide up the ice with the puck and make anything more than a basic play. I don't think his skill and playmaking are high-end; you see good flashes from him, although it's inconsistent, and on the power play for Oshawa he was more of a net-front guy. There's a lot of developing left in his game in terms of making some better reads, filling out his frame and cleaning up his stride, but his combination of high-level athleticism and work ethic could make him a valuable player as he continues to develop. He's one of the youngest players in his class too, which makes me somewhat optimistic that he has more room to grow.

Oshawa's acting coach Greg Nemisz said: “He's still raw, but he's developed into a modern-day power forward and been one of our best players. He's [6-foot-5] and still growing, but he can skate, and he's got enough skill to make plays.”",,,"From the video I watched of Noel at the Ivan Hlinka tournament to seeing him live in the middle of the season to his performance at the World U18 Championship, I saw a player who was really figuring out how good he can be. One of the biggest forwards in the draft, Noel is a solid skater who has shown improvement in his ability to make plays. He doesn't rely solely on his size to overpower the opposition, even though he probably can. He attacks the net well and can make plays in transition. I think there are some valid concerns about his overall hockey sense and his ability to finish off plays, but he closed the season on a rather high note with Canada at the World U18 Championship, collecting six points. I think the ceiling is very high for Noel, assuming he continues on this current development trend.","A long, fluid stride generates loads of power and speed for such a big man. He's young for this crop and still quite raw, but the potential for a productive winger with his size and strength is tantalizing. Already a heavy load in the corners and the paint. Has good vision.",,,
2018,RW,72,160,35,MON,,Jesse Ylonen,"Ylonen has played the entire season in Finland's second division pro league, being good but not great there, and he was the top scorer at both the U19 Five Nations tournament in February and U19 Four Nations in April. His stats aren't wow-caliber, but I have little doubt he's a high-end talent who can break open a shift. His skating is high-end, as is his playmaking. He's incredibly elusive with his skating, able to jet up the ice as well as turn on a dime. He can dangle, but he also makes plays to his teammates well and shows very good instincts. That combination allows him to be a real nuisance coming through the neutral zone and to check overall. He's more of a playmaker to me, but he has a fine shot and I've seen his one-timer and wrist shot be dangerous from a distance. My main criticism of Ylonen is he doesn't always grind as hard as he should for pucks, and it doesn't help that his frame is quite slender which led to him struggling when trying to win pucks from men.  If he can add bulk to his frame and get to the inside areas a bit more, the sky's the limit for him.",,,"One of the most intriguing prospects in the draft, Ylonen played most of this season in Finland's second pro division. He was the top scorer among players 18 or younger in the league by a wide margin and was top four among U20 players. Last season, Ylonen lit it up internationally for Finland, but didn't end up making their World Juniors team this turn around. He's a good skater, but needed to get stronger this year, and it seems that he is improving in that regard. Ylonen definitely has high-end skills, but I think there was a reasonable expectation that he'd perform better than he did in Mestis, which isn't a league you often see top Finns playing in during their draft seasons. Ylonen recently signed a deal with the Lahti Pelicans in Liiga, where he'll get to test himself against the country's top professionals.",A hard-working winger who demonstrates quick hands and a nice touch around the net. Had a tremendous U18 tournament in 2016-17 and was strong in the Finnish second tier this season. Slight and slippery. Can sometimes run himself out of space.,,,
2018,D,73,188.5,36,DET,,Jared McIsaac,"McIsaac was a tough player for me to get a read on this season. He has great pedigree and certain great attributes, but I question if he's the kind of player who takes over a game. McIsaac is smooth. He skates really well with an easy stride, and while he's not dynamic, he's comfortable bringing the puck up the ice. He makes a lot of stops being in the right place and making a correct read with his stick/body. McIsaac also moves the puck well, has good vision and could potentially be a second power play guy in the pros. He also makes quite a few glaring mistakes and doesn't have the pure offensive instincts to carry the puck and make creative plays. McIsaac isn't afraid to lean into his checks and can lay out the occasional huge hit due to his speed, size and instincts.",,,"I've been hot and cold on McIsaac all season. I liked the way he played at the World U18 Championship, and he really stood out to me at the beginning of the season at the Ivan Hlinka. I think other players just got better as the season wore on, though. McIsaac is a pretty good two-way player with decent offensive skills. That said, his overall decision-making with the puck, particularly under pressure, is where I grow concerned. In higher-speed games, he has a harder time completing his passes and sometimes looks indecisive. Physically, the tools are there, and I think he'll be able to get better as he gets more reps playing against top players. I just see a little more risk now than I did earlier in the season.",,,,
2018,D,72,200.34,37,VAN,,Jett Woo,,,,"Woo is an interesting prospect in a lot of ways. Injuries hampered him over the course of the season, and Moose Jaw ended up loading up its team for a WHL championship bid that ultimately fell short. That bumped Woo down the lineup a bit. He is one of the most physical defenders in this draft, which is why I think there are a lot of teams that are going to take an especially long look at him. His offensive numbers are not great for a top-end WHL defenseman, but his athleticism may limit those concerns. He skates well, can make a decent pass and has a pretty good shot when he's able to get it off. The lack of offensive upside limits him as the potential top-four guy that he looked like he could be earlier in the year, though. It's more likely he ends up as a low-lineup defenseman with tough defensive matchups. Once thought to be a first-round caliber prospect, I expect him to drop deeper into the second round.",,,,
2018,D,71,285,38,MON,,Alexander Romanov,,,,,,,,"A gifted blueliner, he’s a
strong skater with great
power in each stride and
a low center of gravity, which
gives him good top-end speed.
Defensively, he is a smart
player. Although, at times,
he can be guilty of jumping
out of proper positioning to
deliver an open-ice hit in the
neutral zone. But he does
exhibit good gap control.
Smooth lateral movement
means he’s solid one-onone
defender. However, he
could stand to improve his
defensive decision-making.
From his position on defense,
he’s proven that he can score

a dependable option. He’s a
totally offensively minded blueliner
and he’s always looking
for a route to carry the puck
out of the defensive zone. And
he’s capable of strong outlet
passes to spring his forwards

passing allows his teams to be
aggressive on the breakout

alone makes him an interesting
prospect."
2018,G,74,185,39,NYR,,Olof Lindbom,,,,,,,,"Lindbom is an interesting prospect. It seems to me that he is read-reliant now, but it will serve him well in adapting to higher levels of competition, as will his fairly precise positional adjustments and his comfort behind screens.

He will have to work on his upper-body positioning to avoid being vulnerable to shooters that will beat him with quicker releases and sharper vertical angles on their shots than what Lindbom has experienced up until now. As mentioned earlier, the biggest question about him is whether he has the top-end speed potential to make his strengths work at the highest professional levels.

The standout takeaway about Lindbom is that he lacks deficiencies in his development. There are quite a few things that are already built into his game at this young age. But there are not really any standout, or elite, abilities in the game either.

That makes it hard to predict exactly where his development can take him in the future. The foundation is there, but the question that lingers is where Lindbom’s ceiling is. He is, at the moment, a jack of all trades, but can he turn into a king along the way?"
2018,C,74.25,205.88,40,EDM,,Ryan McLeod,"McLeod, the brother of New Jersey's first-round pick Mike McLeod, is a divisive prospect among scouts I've talked to. There are some nights where he looks like a top-level prospect, and other nights where he'll fade into the background.He has a real fluidness to not only how he skates, as he's a high-end skater, but also how he calmly controls and distributes the puck. McLeod gains the zone as well as anyone due to his speed, skill and size. Too often though, once inside the zone, he can be passive, not looking to make quick plays to net and preferring to be stationary. There are questions about his physical game and how he'll be able to win battles and get inside versus pros. His talent doesn't match up to his numbers as well, as his production for a late 1999 birth date in the OHL is just fine. His upside is massive. Few forwards, never mind centers, in this draft have his profile of size, speed, skill and IQ. There are a lot of doubts if he'll ever be able to realize it though. He's good enough defensively that he can turn into a fine two-way center if he never realizes his offensive potential.","After watching McLeod thrive on Mississauga's top line in the 2017 playoffs I — like with McShane — expected a huge year out of McLeod this season. He's an older kid in this draft and it was his time to become the Steelheads' best player when Owen Tippett and his brother Michael weren't with the team out of the gate. But McLeod didn't progress like I expected he would. He was still one of the best draft-eligible OHL forwards and his team's third-leading scorer, but he has the tools to be a lot more than the point-per-game player he was. Not only is he one of the best skaters in all of junior hockey and certainly this class, but he is also an excellent playmaker. To his credit, he did shoot more this year and tried to become more of a scoring threat so that the bulk of his game (his effortless speed, his strong handling, and his passing) could open up. He's already an NHL skater, but he too often uses it to put himself into the corner or behind the net and there have been concerns about his attitude.",,"One of the draft's most explosive skaters, McLeod is physically advanced among his draft peers. His strength is a big advantage because I think his puck skills are fairly average in terms of stickhandling and shiftiness. He's a good distributor, though, and he has a nice shot. When he has less time and space, he's less effective offensively, as he makes some questionable decisions with the puck. That raises some questions about his overall hockey sense. Being as fast as he is, I'd like to see some more dominance offensively at the junior level. It's going to be interesting to see what his numbers look like next season with brother Michael and Panthers top prospect Owen Tippett likely gone from Mississauga. That will make Ryan the focal point of opposing teams, forcing him to fight through even more adversity to produce. A guy who moves as well as McLeod is certainly going to give himself a chance to make an impact, but there's still rounding out he needs to do.","Speed runs in the family. Isn't as hard-nosed as his older brother, Michael but plays a similar game. Missed the 2017 cut-off by a week so the developmental arc is a little clearer. Lack of creativity and a high-offensive ceiling. Lower ceiling player but plays a pro-style game.",,,
2017,C,72.5,178.55,1,NJD,,Nico Hischier,"Everything has been pointing in the right direction for Hischier this season. He was fantastic from the word ""go,"" between league and international play, and has put himself into the discussion to go first overall. He's the complete package offensively. He's a very good skater, with the ability to be dangerous due to his first step and top gear but particularly due to how elusive he is from a standstill. Hischier is a creative puck handler who can dictate possession with his skill and often stands out with how he can generate offense with his creativity. However, his best trait is his hockey sense. He anticipates pressure so well, moves the puck into the right places and outsmarts defenders. ""[Hischier] can take over a game and does so consistently,"" one scout said. He's not a bulky guy, but he gets to the net with frequency and is a solid defensive center. He can potentially be a very good top-six player for his NHL team.",,,,"Top end speed, vision and processing skills. He's incredibly gifted at finding quiet spaces and exposing defenders whose gap control is even just marginally off. His soft hands and deft puck protection allow him to work his magic down low while his quick release is deadly from the circles down. The best offensive player in this crop",,,"Hischier is a very smooth skater that can turn on a
dime and keep his speed while doing so. He is very
agile and is hard to contain along the board. Nico
is very well balanced on his feet and can make sharp 180
degree spins to escape opponents during battles along the
board.
You think he'll be pinned and won't be able to escape,
and then he surprises you by making a move and quickly
dangling his way off the wall and into a scoring opportunity.
His speed is above average but he rarely seems to go full
speed, instead using his quickness, agility and creativity to
elude.
He draws penalties due to his elusiveness. Hischier's great
anticipation and hockey sense allow him to retrieve a puck
even after it leaves his blade - the puck appears glued to his
stick as he possesses magic hands in tight. He possesses top
end hands which he uses to beat defenders and goaltenders
with high-end skill plays. He is not a one-trick pony as he
can skillfully deke out defenseman via 1-on-1 rushes or
keep his opponent off guard by giving the puck quickly to
another teammate, finding open space and getting the puck
back when he has more time to create or culitvate a scoring
opportunity.
He is equally skilled with dexterity and smoothness on
his backhand as he is on his forehand. His passes are
consistently on tape, delivered through the tightest of lanes
and he displays great hand eye coordination as he is able to
control bouncing pucks.
His shot is not the most powerful but it is very accurate
and deceptive, with quick releases while off balance. The
offensive game looks too easy for him in many instances.
Defensively, he is usually in good position to support his
teammates, anticipating the play well and generating quick
breakouts.
He is primarily an offensive catalyst so there is some definite defensive work to be done in his game. He is not very
physical, and is easily pushed off the puck and eliminated in
traffic due to his lack of strength. On a couple of occasions
this season he was, more or less, shut down when opponents played him rough and tough. As this happened in the
Quebec junior league, he will need to work hard to prove he
can battle through being handled by bigger opponents at
the NHL level. Another concern we have is his tendency to
take his foot off the pedal during games."
2017,C,74,198.82,2,PHI,,Nolan Patrick,"Patrick didn't have the best draft season he could have envisioned, mostly because he missed a substantial part of the season due to injury. However, he remains a top prospect. Patrick's best trait is his hockey sense. He's a highly creative playmaker, with high-end vision and puck skills. He can dictate the tempo of a game, with pro-level pace in his decisions and the ability to slow the play and find his options. Patrick also shows an above-average shot and can generate it from tight spaces. His skating isn't as dynamic as his playmaking, as it's more about pro average than top level, but he'll be able to keep up in the NHL. He's a player without a glaring flaw, as he'll be what you want in a top-level center: a two-way forward with skill, size and intelligence who can contribute in all areas of the game.",,,,"Patrick is a franchise-level, big, strong, and smart top-line center with a complete game who should pay quick dividends. Often injured in recent years, whoever drafts him will do their due diligence and cross fingers hoping past injuries don't impact future performance.",,,"Patrick is a top-line center that plays both ends of
the ice. He processes the game so quickly that there
is rarely hesitation in his play. He is always moving
his feet and gains momentum because of his ability to
accelerate quickly; starting and stopping on the puck. His
stride length is excellent and he shows great hustle. He has
the ability to quickly change direction and move laterally to
cut off and get ahead of opponents. His skillset is so wellrounded and he is so hungry to achieve success that it can
be difficult for an opponent to defend him at this level.
His passing game is solid, hitting teammates for clean passes with just the right amount of mustard. He is an unselfish
player who draws so much attention to himself that it allows
more space for his teammates to get to open spots. He
shoots the puck without hesitation, and is able to unload
quickly with both velocity and accuracy. He has good timing
on his shots and can really queue up a dangerous one-timer. He can overwhelm his opponents by being heavy on
the puck and showing off effective puckhandling and puck
protection skills.
He isn't all flash and dash but a lot of the highly-skilled plays
he makes go without much credit. His quickness and skill
make him one of the most disruptive players on the ice - he
is capable of magically stealing pucks and making a play before opponents know the puck is off their blade. His reach,
hand eye coordination and positioning, including his ability
to break up plays defensively, make no puck in his general
vicinity safe. He shows high IQ with his decision-making
skills on and off the puck. He is hard on the body and plays
with healthy aggression. He has a physical edge to him and
can rock opponents with a timely hit. Patrick will stand up
for himself when challenged, fighting and feeding some
solid punches to opponents who think they can intimidate
him. He competes hard; displayed by his willingness to engage on second and third efforts to disrupt plays, trying to
make an impact all over the ice.
We all know he can play and has the prerequisite skills to
contribute at the next level but for a guy who had difficulty
staying out of sick bay since suffering a sports hernia during
the 2015-16 WHL playoffs, there are some injury concerns
that will need to be alleviated by medical professionals.
There have also been some rumblings about an all-aboutme type of attitude creeping in this season and perceived
lackadaisical play in some games, but in our opinion those
concerns are overblown. "
2017,D,70,172.16,3,DAL,,Miro Heiskanen,"Heiskanen established himself as a regular in the middle of a top Finnish league team's lineup as one of the younger players in this draft class. I would characterize him as more of an offensive defenseman, but he shows great ability at both ends of the rink. His hockey sense is advanced to the point that he dictates the play due to how effectively he moves the puck. He makes great decisions, understands how to create chances while keeping his plays simple and overall shows no issues playing at a pro pace. His mobility is very good as well, as he can get up into the rush and close his gaps efficiently. He's a little shorter than average for an NHL defender and needs bulk, but I see his IQ translating well down the line.",,,,"The cerebral and smooth-skating defender offers the complete package of tools. He's calm under pressure as he man's the power play, finds lanes for shots and is rarely out of position. His mind and skating are his biggest assets. A future minute-muncher.",,,"Heiskanen is a poised, mobile, puck-moving
blueliner who is a fluid skater. He has quick strides
and crossovers that give him good acceleration
and burst in tight spaces. He transitions smoothly from
backwards to forwards.
Calm and poised under pressure, Heiskanen is great at using
his smarts and lateral quickness to escape forecheckers in
his own end. He is a calm and skilled puck-handler who is
good at retrieving pucks off the boards and then quickly
moving them out of his own zone. He has a good first pass
out of the defensive zone, always scanning the ice for his
options and making the right decision what to do with the
puck before forechecking pressure arrives.
He is very good at making an accurate pass without setting
his feet, even while under pressure from opposing players.
He is utilized well as the point man on the power play, using
his good skating agility to control the puck at the blue line
and moving across the zone to open up different options.
He shows confidence backtracking with the puck, displays
good puck control and keeps his head up to start another
attack.
His passes are constantly crisp and easy for forwards to
receive. In his own zone, he does a good job controlling the
gap against his man, showing decent lateral movements
and smooth transitions on his edges to apply pressure when
moving across the defensive zone. He isn't overly physical,
relying more on his defensive awareness, smarts and active
stick to prevent dangerous chances in the slot area.
He is adept at poking his stick out at the last second to
prevent a pass, and positions himself well to cover multiple
passing lanes when monitoring a forward coming out of the
corner. He consistently makes the right plays and displays
excellent D-zone coverage. Always fully aware of the
action around the net, he never leaves his man, or the net,
uncovered.
Heiskanen's average size is probably his only real weakness.
His shot, while consistently on net, is a little on the weak
side as well but will improve with added strength. He will
need to hit the weight room and add considerable strength
to meet and excel against the rigors of the NHL game. Overall, Heiskanen plays a defensively responsible low-risk game
that should translate well to the NHL despite his lean frame."
2017,D,71.25,187.44,4,COL,,Cale Makar,"Makar was lights-out this season in the AJHL, including a dominant performance at the World Junior A challenge. Small, old (he's a late 1998 birth date) defensemen from Junior A don't get me excited that often, but Makar deserves a ton of recognition, thanks to his talent level. Makar skates very well, with a good burst out of each stride. He's aggressive jumping into the play, and he can pressure opponents with his speed. He's also a highly skilled puck handler, with high-end offensive instincts. He can make tough offensive plays with consistency and quarterback a power play with the best of them. His defense was passable at the Junior A level, but scouts are concerned about him checking pros. His size is the main issue, as he has a short wingspan and can struggle to win battles or close gaps. He wasn't even on his Junior A team's penalty kill for a good chunk of the season. He has as much upside as any defenseman in the class, and though he might seem like a guy I usually tend to like, there's a bunch of alarm bells going off in my brain at the same time. He is committed to UMass-Amherst for next season.",,,,"Big time draft riser may offer the most offensive skill set from any position this year. Playing in a tier II Canadian junior circuit, the right-handed defender displays dynamic speed and edgework, incredible offensive instincts, smarts and creativity to burn. His ability to run a power play with his head, hands and big shot make him a complete threat. There is some risk, but the payoff is certainly worth it. ",,,"Makar is a small, but smooth-skating intelligent
blueliner with elite offensive instincts. He skates
with an effortless stride and excellent balance,
moving in any direction with fluidity, without losing any
speed. Adding to that is his propensity for shoulder fakes,
shot feigns and purposeful maneuvering of his upper-body.
Even at full speed, while his feet are moving in a straight
line, he is continuously changing his head, shoulder, and
hand position to mask his intentions on the attack and keep
defenders off balance. Due to his sense and speed he adapts
quickly to his environment and is excellent at finding room
to make a play on the fly. Another aspect that makes him
incredibly difficult to read is that he has very strong wrists.
He needs very little time to rip a backdoor pass or take an off
balance shot.
He often catches goalies off guard with his shot and needs
very little windup to execute a shot or pass. Bringing it all
together is a creative, clever, and astute hockey mind. He
shows little restraints to his offensive game and is often
seen leading the rush and driving low, letting instincts take
over. Defensively Makar has made big strides since he first
entered the league. He plays with a lot of intensity and is
very aggressive. He disrupts a lot of attacks as he excels at
reading the play and stays tight to his man.
He's not a physical player and relies a lot on his mobility to
close gaps and cover passing lanes. He uses his crafty stick
and excellent timing to pick pocket, intercept and strip
pucks in open ice or board battles.
Makar's obvious weakness is his size - being five-foot-11 isn't
ideal for those aspiring to become an NHL defenseman. That
being said, Makar has added a lot of strength to his frame,
effectively standing up to some bigger attackers in the AJHL
this season. Defensively there are times he can be overly
aggressive and if he reads the play wrong he can be left exposed. At his current league level he is right more often than
not, but he may have to tune his risk/reward instincts as he
faces tougher completion.
In the same vein, Makar's desire to make an immediate
impact can also serve as a negative with extended stretches
in his own zone. His defensive positioning can deteriorate as
he becomes puck focused. Those are areas that you project
him to grow in as he gains experience. He is going to need
to bulk up and play a little grittier going forward, but his
offensive upside will be hard to ignore in a draft lacking in
high-end talent. "
2017,C,73.75,164.62,5,VAN,,Elias Pettersson,"Pettersson was a significant riser this season, after producing at a point-per-game pace versus men in Sweden and often appearing on highlight reels for positive reasons. Pettersson has very quick hands and a ton of creativity in his game, and even when he's being tightly checked, he's able to generate space for himself. He sees the ice very well and can make difficult feeds. ""He has the talent to be a star,"" one scout said. That doesn't mean Pettersson's game is perfect. He has heavy feet and struggles to win battles as he has a wiry frame and isn't a very intense battler. On the other hand, it's hard to ignore his significant point-producing potential as a pro and his ability to be a game-breaker on the ice. In my viewings, I didn't see him ever have a great game. However, every Swedish scout I've talked to was willing to go to bat for him as a top-end prospect.",,,,The slight forward thinks the game a step ahead of most players his age. His top-end speed leaves something to be desired but his creativity and strong positional play make him a coach's dream. He needs at least 20 lbs of muscle packed on before handling an NHL schedule. ,,,"Pettersson is a positionally-sound pivot with edgeof-your-seat highlight reel worthy puck skills. He
has natural offensive creativity and shows good
patience with the puck. His skating is above-average with
an impressive “jersey flapping” top gear. Speed isn't his only
standout attribute, he also displays great hockey sense
and awareness, always aware of where his teammates are,
allowing him to distribute quick, accurate passes, including
no-look and drop passes.
In addition, he has quick, skilled hands and excellent
one-on-one moves that allow him to finesse his way past
defensive players or deke out goaltenders with a quick
move. He is very poised with the puck in the offensive zone,
displaying good patience and good vision to find open
passing lanes while being pressured. He has a dangerous
shot with a deceiving release that has been known to give
goaltenders fits.
He is very confident with the puck, displays good patience
and good vision to find open passing lanes while being
pressured. He doesn't initiate contact often, but isn't afraid
of going to the corners to retrieve the puck. He works
hard on the defensive end and seems to understand the
defensive responsibilities of the center position, and how to
best interact with defensemen to work as a unit.
 He can be rotated to the wing at times, showing versatility,
but still does a good job supporting the puck low in his
own zone and is quick and decisive once he gets control.
He is good at getting in on the forecheck, creating a lot of
pressure and establishing a cycle game together with his
linemates.
His biggest standout attribute is certainly his speed, as defensemen have great troubles keeping up with him when he
rushes through the neutral zone. However, despite having
an impressive top gear, he needs to work on his leg strength
as his explosiveness and first few steps are rather lacking at
this stage.
His core strength is also an area that needs to be addressed
as he can be easily rubbed off the puck along the boards.
He needs to bulk up to be more successful using his pure
speed, and needs to improve his puck protection ability. The
strength deficit also hurts Pettersson's defensive play, as he
finds it difficult to use his body to defend or take his man off
the puck. Instead, he tends to just use his stick every time,
with limited success."
2017,C,73.75,177.86,6,VGK,,Cody Glass,"Glass wasn't on my top 30 to start the season, nor was he on Canada's radar for the Ivan Hlinka tournament, but he erupted at the start of the season and maintained his play throughout the campaign. He's a dynamic playmaker, who has the skill, size and IQ to be a significant scorer in the NHL. Glass' puck skills are very good, with the IQ and skill combo to create scoring chances out of nothing. He's very coordinated with the puck for a player his size, and he makes tough dekes seem easy. He's a smart playmaker who can make plays at a quick tempo and control the center third of the ice. Some scouts I talk to praise his skating. I haven't seen a blow-you-away gear from him, but he's certainly above average in that area. Defensively, he is decent. His frame needs to bulk up a ton, as he can be pushed off pucks too easily, but he works hard for pucks and has the IQ to be useful in his own end.",,,,"A terrific WHL season has shot him up the rankings and for good reason. He's the best pure playmaker in the draft, owns a sizable frame and an underrated shot. He's in line for a monster draft-plus one campaign and has the potential to become the best centre from the bunch.",,,"Glass is a tall, lanky pivot who plays a gritty, skilled,
thinking man's game. He is a two-way guy, making
a ton of impact plays at both ends of the ice. He can
play a north-south game but also possesses some shiftiness
and finesse to his approach. He sees the ice extremely well
and his passing game, while lacking high-end creativity, is
effective at threading the needle through tight areas while
in motion.
He has silky hands in tight and is a danger to do damage
around the crease or to jam in a backdoor play. Has a good
wrist shot and backhander with the type of accuracy that
allows him to finish off plays. He is patient, looks for and
finds open lanes to the net and gets his shots off with
quickness on the release. He utilizes an active stick in the
defensive zone to get to loose pucks, close off lanes or to
deflect pucks. He has a bit of a rugged side to him, although
he isn't a true hard-nosed player. He uses a smart approach
to checking and doesn't always have to be a brute to slip
in, separate the puck from the body and make a heads up
play out of the zone. Shows great compete to get quick on
pucks and make decisive plays. He is able to muscle through
checks and shift his angles to protect the puck with a man
on him.
Glass always seemed to be in a great position to support
the play. He is smart and times puck arrivals so he had the
element of surprise on his side. He is proficient at seeing
plays develop; angling bodies to the boards and stepping
up to make himself available for passes before clearing
the zone. He shows a bit of an edge, but doesn't show the
aggression to instigate a lot of rough stuff. His play can look
understated in many games but then you check and he has
his name all over the scoresheet.
Glass isn't a top tier skater as he looks and moves a little
awkward. We wouldn't call him slow as he gets up to speed
quickly, but he is not a burner and his stride is choppy. His
skating will be able to be corrected and improved as he
works on his technique with a skating coach. The ability to
add strength and mass will help his game develop further
as he is currently a slender kid. Although this is fine at the
current WHL level he will need to add strength to compete
at the NHL level. He is not projected to be a real top end
offensive contributor at the NHL level."
2017,C,71,200.68,7,NYR,,Lias Andersson,"Andersson was a solid piece for HV71 and Sweden's World Junior team this season. All he has done is produce wherever he's gone the past few seasons. He won't dazzle with high-end dekes, but there is a lot of skill to Andersson's game. He makes quick decisions, has a quick shot, sees his options well and has good puck skills. He can be a standout offensive player, though that isn't always the case. Andersson might be below average in size, but he's tough and strong for a player his age, and he can kill penalties adequately. I don't love his skating, but he isn't dragging anvils all over the ice, and considering all the other positive attributes in his offensive game, you can live without game-breaking speed.",,,,"Played in the top Swedish league for majority of the last two campaigns and looked strong. Doesn't excel in any particular skill, but has a well-stocked tool belt. A very safe player. ",,,"Andersson is a strong, intelligent, and mature twoway center who gives a strong effort in all situations
and demonstrates tenacity; constantly finding ways
to impact the game. He is a fine skater with good power,
using long strides to get up to top speed quickly. He doesn't
show breakaway speed, but has enough speed to stay
ahead of the play.
Despite his sub six-foot size, he's very good along the wall
and knows how to leverage his low center of gravity to get
underneath larger opponents and protect the puck with his
body. He's adept at cycling the puck in the offensive zone,
showing good lower-body strength and the instincts to peel
off the boards and get to the front of the net when given
an open lane. He is also dangerous when given time in the
offensive zone, as he possesses good vision and the ability
to shoot with good power while off-balance.
Although creative, he plays a relatively simple, smart and
efficient game. He has an accurate shot with velocity, fooling
goaltenders with its quick release and placement. He is
dominant on face-offs. He leans offense, but backchecks
hard and keeps his head on a swivel to cover the trailing
man on the rush. Andersson is very defensively aware and
shows a consistent effort in skating hard on the back check
to support his defenders, making plays on the puck carrier.
He can play both center and wing but is a natural center
as he does a good job coming down deep to support and
being part of the breakout.
When playing wing he does a good job covering his point
man and pressuring the puck along the wall to try and
create a turnover. He shows good two-way awareness, has
a mature approach to defense and some strong offensive
abilities making him a well-rounded prospect.
We hear a lot of chatter about Andersson being a rough
skater” with feet that “will holdhi back at the next level but
we do not share these scouting opinions. Although his explosiveness and consistency could use some improvement,
he like his developing mobility. He is a prospect with a solid
overall two-way game but is not likely going to become a
high-end offensive catalyst in the NHL. We see him as a very
good second line center in a Henrik Zetterberg-type, twoway role but there are plenty out there who see him as a
bottom-six, third or fourth line, forward at best in the NHL.
Will that effect his draft status, as teams tend to go for those
prospects who can fill the net and influence the scoreboard?
We like him plenty and think he can affect the score of the
game substantially, which is why we ranked him so highly."
2017,C,71.5,198.98,8,BUF,,Casey Mittelstadt,"Mittelstadt has been a highly touted player for a few years, and he was a top player in the USHL this past season for Green Bay and also had a successful stint back with his high school team. Mittelstadt is a dynamic playmaker who can generate scoring chances in bunches. He can dangle in open ice with the best of them, playing with pace, and can make a highlight happen at any given moment. Mittelstadt sees the ice very well, often executing on high-difficulty feeds and being a primary starting point of offense. His skating isn't as dynamic as his hands, but he skates well and has a separation gear in his feet. Off the puck, he isn't as great. Despite a strong frame, he loses more battles than he should. His defense has a ways to go, but it could be worse, as he can make the odd defensive play. He is committed to the University of Minnesota for next season.",,,,"Powerful centre somehow increases his speed with the puck than without. Owns dynamic acceleration, hands and a lethal release. Sometimes guilty of trying to do too much, which may lead to a bit longer of wait time, but he owns top end stuff.",,,"Mittelstadt is an all-situations, high-compete
center who constantly looks to create offensive
chances for his team. He is a huge driver in
possession and absolutely dominates in one-on-one
situations with finesse moves and a creative mind. He has
top tier awareness and vision, constantly getting himself
and the puck into scoring areas before a threat is detected
by the defense.
He has a physical edge and a tenacious approach with
his willingness to attack the net. Mittelstadt also has a
soft touch with the puck and can magically stickhandle
through traffic whether he is stationary or moving at full
speed. He has the strength to generate power and speed
from his first stride forward, accelerating quickly and soon
to an overwhelming pace. With great patience to wait out
opponents and goaltenders, Mittelstadt morphs from a
hardnosed power-forward into a soft touch finisher.
His shot is heavy and accurate but his release is absolutely
deadly. His shot has a very quick release and can generate
good power without much time or space. He is really
effective around the crease with quick reaction to create
shots off the pass. He won't pass up the opportunity to
shoot the puck but also has a great, cerebral passing game.
He doesn't hesitate to dig in the dirty areas of the ice. Aware
in his own end and always with his stick in a passing lane, he
is continuously closing off the oppositions' attack.
Mittelstadt is also a hard worker on the forecheck, using his
quick first step to pressure defenders. He has an active stick
that allows him to knock down pucks or close off lanes. He
has the tools to sneak up behind opponents, strip pucks
causing turnovers and carry a possession from goal line to
goal line, thanks to his high-end all-round skillset.
While he does play the game at a high tempo and pace, he
could improve his top speed, as he is more quick and darting than fast. In his own end, Mittelstadt is sound positionally, supporting the puck down low in the zone and picking
up the man in front of the net well. However, the technical
aspects of the center position, such as face-off technique
and backchecking positioning on transition plays, could use
improvement. Finally, he can get a little too individual in his
play, a negative effect of playing high school hockey with
lesser talented teammates no doubt. That will need to be
addressed and corrected when he plays at higher levels as
the competition will shut his individual rushes effectively"
2017,C,77.5,221.22,9,DET,,Michael Rasmussen,"It's easy to imagine why some scouts would be optimistic about a 6-foot-6 center with significant scoring numbers. Although Rasmussen has put up a ton of goals this season, I've been more impressed by his passing skills. He's a smart playmaker who plays at a pro-level pace. He has vision and a good shot, and I've seen Tri-City lean on his size as a net-front player on the power play. Rasmussen is also solid defensively and wins puck battles using his size. His main drawback is his skating. He's below-average in terms of speed, and though that isn't a huge issue in the grand scheme of his skill set, it keeps him from being truly dynamic.",,,,"His power play proclivity (29 points in 50 games), time spent on the penalty kill and goal scoring prowess makes him a reasonable pick-up, even if people are knocking his even-strength production (only 3 primary assists at ES). Rasmussen for a center hangs around the net a lot and is good at using his size to collect rebounds for second-chance points. ",,,"Rasmussen is a big center who looks to put the puck
in the net. He's not an overly explosive skater but is
extremely balanced and displays good mechanics that
allow him to be elusive when going in and out of coverage.
He is a savvy puck-handler who uses his reach effectively
and can control the puck through traffic, highlighting a
power game with skilled stick work. He widens his base with
the puck and is a pillar of strength when opponents attempt
to knock him off the puck.
Rasmussen's offensive IQ is on full display with his ability to
put pucks in the right places to create scoring opportunities.
Plays hard on the wall and takes plays to the net, both with
or without the puck, using his body to create space and his
hands to move the puck with skill, sometimes attempting
a tip from a point shot. He has a very quick release which
goalies find hard to track. Likes to shoot the puck often
and from many various angles and gets a lot of whip on his
shots.
When he has time to wind up he can get an impressive
amount of velocity on the puck. His vision on the ice is
very good. He sees the ice well and is able to find the open
passing lanes. Rasmussen is not afraid to throw the body
or to engage in chippy after the whistle scrums. Attentive
detail to the defensive zone as he uses his feet and skating
effectively to get the inside track on his opponents. He gets
his stick under his opponent's and has a knack for breaking
up play and picking off pass attempts by thinking out the
play and situating himself in lanes. He is entrusted with
power play and PK assignments along with taking key faceoffs. Rarely do you find a player with his size, skill and smarts
who is a highly effective 200-foot player.
Though he is physically engaged, he still has some significant weight to add before becoming fully grown. Plenty of
mass to add even at 200 pounds due to his height and lanky
build.
He's not an overly explosive skater, due to a lack of leg
strength, but he is extremely balanced and has good
mechanics that allow him to be elusive when going in and
out of coverage. With some weight room time focusing on
his legs he could turn his first steps from a deficiency into
a strength. He has the capability of being an impact player
whenever he's on the ice, elevating and complementing his
teammates. However, consistency is an area that he needs
to improve as he can absolutely dominate for stretches before going quiet for periods at a time. He has a lot of growth
potential and even though he's not the most dynamic player, he thinks the game and can play at a high level."
2017,RW,72.5,202.76,10,FLA,,Owen Tippett,"The cousin of the No. 33 overall pick in 2015, Mitchell Stephens (Tampa Bay Lightning), Tippett is a very exciting winger to watch. He was a dominant goal scorer this season, due to both the quality and quantity of shots on goal. Tippett is one of the best speedsters in the draft class. His ability to go from 0 to 60 -- metaphorically speaking, though he's darn quick -- is very impressive, and he can gain the offensive blue line with ease. He has a high skill level and can make some open-ice plays, but he's much more comfortable going north-south than east-west. He can kill penalties due to his speed and IQ, and can be a shorthanded scoring threat while doing so. Tippett's game is more about playing in straight lines, but don't let his very tilted goal-to-assist ratio fool you, as he can make plays to his teammates too, a facet of his game that improved as the season went on.",,,,"Concerns over hockey sense and ability to play without the puck are reasonably legit, but he owns the best shot in the draft and as such the goal scoring potential is through the roof. Needs to score more goals within five feet of the net though.",,,"Tippett is a natural goal-scorer with the speed and
size combo that has NHL teams very excited. He is a
great skater, powerful and balanced, generating high
levels of speed. He has a finisher's touch and goal-scorer's
mentality, getting himself premier looks at the net. He
has a lethal shot, with an all-world release and impressive
strength behind it that rivals many NHL goal-scorers.
He gets into dangerous areas without the puck, looking
for a pass and getting his shot off quickly. His willingness
to release his shot early and often leads to some juicy
rebounds in front of the net and some sustained
possessions in the offensive end for his team. He is strong
on the puck, driving down the wing with power and speed,
putting himself into strong shooting positions, unafraid to
take the puck to the net by driving through traffic.
Known for his lethal, NHL level shot, Tippett also proves to
be an excellent passer with solid vision who can accurately
get the puck where it needs to be. Not only does Tippett
create passing lanes all over the ice through his speedy
skating, he has an incredible ability to protect the puck
using body positioning and strength when pressured
without a solid outlet. Tippett plays in all situations but
really excels at 5 on 5 and the power play.
He's an absolute terror for PK units as he quarter backs the
PP from the high circle and blue line, tossing sharp passes
all over the zone, dangling his way out of tight spots and
unleashing his laser beam shot. Tippett looks to be at his
best on the rush when he can couple his speed and shot
together. Defensively, his speed is especially dangerous
on the forecheck where his quick feet can put pressure on
defenders, causing turnovers.
The weakest part of Tippett's game is on the defensive side
of the puck where he doesn't compete hard enough to regain possession of the puck. As an example, during races for
loose pucks, Tippett will often slam on the breaks to avoid
body contact - essentially handing the opposing player
puck possession and forcing him to chase. He will need to
improve his puck retrieval skills and compete level when
he does not have the puck. Tippett's speed is rarely seen
defensively and he is often seen coasting on the back check.
Contrast that with the speed demon that he is when he has
the puck and you can see there is much less urgency to his
defensive play. He also tends to make some head-scratching,
dead ending, plays that leave you questioning his hockey
sense. One lesser flaw that we have noticed is he consistently overplays the puck and attempts overly complex plays."
2017,C,74.75,202.8,11,LAK,,Gabriel Vilardi,"Big men who can make plays with the puck are hard to find, and Vilardi fits the bill. His skill is legitimately at the top level, as his ability to maintain possession, create offense off the rush and evade pressure is as good as that of some of the better 5-foot-11 forwards. He also possesses good vision and can make tough distributions seem easy. He's a player who makes his teammates better, with Windsor's coach noting how Vilardi's teammates have a giant Corsi differential with him, as opposed to without him on their line. He'll battle hard for pucks and use his size well on some shifts, and although he isn't perfectly consistent in that area, he has shown more edge in his game this season and has gotten better defensively because of it. Vilardi's skating is an issue, with a below-average top gear. Scouts I talk to are divided on him. Some NHL people see him as a clear top-five guy in this draft class, due to his size/skill combo and the upside, while others are more tentative, due to warts in the all-around game.",,,,"As a 17-year-old competing against super star 19 and 20-year-old players at the Memorial Cup, Vilardi proved he can produce against higher competition. Vilardi has a very strong and heavy stick and is extremely difficult to strip of the puck, dominates possession down low. ",,,"Vilardi is a smart, strong and rangy offensive
center. He is a quiet skater who, when not winning
board battles, glides around the half wall waiting to
strike on any loose pucks. He uses his power to get to the
net, drive through contact and essential get the puck where
he wants it to be.
His puck protection is incredible as he uses his strong legs
to push away defenders and maintain possession along the
boards. He is also able to use his skating power and core
strength to protect the puck while driving to the net and
getting the puck from the outside to the center of the ice,
making him vital to his team. Vilardi spends most of his time
below the dots in the offensive zone and this is where he
is most effective. With his solid frame, Vilardi uses perfect
body positioning to win board battles and come out of
the corners with the puck on his stick, subsequently using
solid vision to toss pucks into the slot to tee up waiting
teammates.
If his teammates are all tied up, he is able to skate the puck
out himself and patiently waits for holes to open up for
either a pass or shot. The passing game is where Vilardi is
most valuable as he has the excellent vision to find the best
option as well as the ability to make the quick pass to that
location. Vilardi's playmaking skills also come from his ability
to find open space and sneak in behind his opponents,
often taking them by surprise. He has a sniper's ability with a
bomb of a shot that gets off his stick like a firecracker. Finds
great spots all over the ice the few times he doesn't have the
puck on his stick.
He is engaged in the play at both ends, providing good puck
support and forechecking hard. Vilardi can be a differencemaker on defense, covering for rushing defenders and
sometimes being the first player back on defense.
Currently, Vilardi's skating is lacking and he must utilize his
hockey IQ to be proactive instead of reactive with his feet.
Slow and meandering; it takes him an extra step or two
longer when he needs to get up to speed and stay with the
play. Although not a noticeable flaw in small spaces as he
does have quickness and a long reach to have an impact, he
will need to spend some considerable time improving his
stride to be able to meet his potential at the NHL level.
His consistency is another area needing improvement as he
can be so dominating in one game, controlling the offensive
zone play and possession, and then looks behind the play in
other views we have had this season. "
2017,C,73,178.34,12,CAR,,Martin Necas,"Necas was an effective player this season for a team in the top Czech league at age 17, though he played on a team that was deep in scoring talent. He's a dynamic talent, and his skating ability is very good, as he is one of the quicker skaters available this year. Although he excels when playing a fast-paced game, Necas is also a very good playmaker who can slow the game down and make plays from the boards. He controls the puck well and can make above-average plays with his hands. His off-the-puck will need work going forward. You see the odd good defensive play that exemplifies his IQ, but he's clearly more polished with the puck than without and has a lot to learn to get bigger minutes as a pro. As a smaller player, winning more battles will go a long way.",,,,"The quick and often-times dynamic center has shown very well against men in the Czech top league. Needs to bring the same energy every night, but has a ton of skill. Likely a longer wait, but potential to be a quality fantasy player down the line. ",,,"Necas is an electric, offensively-skilled center. He is
a shifty skater with impressive edgework and
great pivots. Transitions well with puck and has
the acceleration to blow by opponents. He frequently
creates separation between him and his check by quickly
accelerating forwards, backwards or laterally. That also helps
him on the forecheck and backcheck, as he plays aggressive
toward the puck-carrier and never slows down.
Aggressive stick-work on the forecheck allows Necas to force
turnovers deep in the offensive zone. His offensive IQ is
high-end and he displays excellent hockey sense and puck
skills. He is very aggressive at pushing the pace of play and
isn't afraid to carry the puck into the offensive zone himself.
He frequently finds ways to get open and get separation
from defensemen, which makes him a dangerous attack
option when he finds soft spots in the slot.
He is especially dangerous on the power play, working
along the half boards and keeping his feet moving to get a
clean look at the net. He does a good job of getting to the
soft spots, creating chances to unleash his one-timer.
He has a quick and accurate shot that has a deceptive
release. He uses his eyes and body language to sell a pass
before changing the angle of his blade to get a puck on
net. His defensive game and positioning could use some
work, but he definitely puts in a decent effort. Necas does a
good job supporting his defenders deep into his own zone,
coming down low into his own end to provide a good outlet
pass, gaining speed as he comes out of his own zone. He is
good positionally and keeps his feet moving in his own end,
closing off passing lanes with his stick and turning the puck
quickly up the ice and out of his zone when he controls it.
The skinny centerman has a pretty good game overall but
his lack of strength and physicality get exposed, though
that should improve naturally over time as he works to add
muscle. His lack of strength does not seem to have any impact on his desire to play aggressively, though with limited
success in physical battles. He does most of his successful
defensive work using his active stick. If he can add some
muscle mass to his frame and really work on his lower-body
strength he could be a real impact player at the NHL level.
Necas could also get stronger on the face-off dot if he improved his upper-body strength. He isn't afraid to fight for
the puck and dig in the corners, but he seems to be forced
into a little bit of a perimeter player because of his small size.
Sometimes he gets a little too fancy when he could make
the simple and safe play."
2017,C,71,183.2,13,MON,,Nick Suzuki,"Suzuki was consistently impressive and one of the top overall players in the OHL this season. The first thing any scout will say about him is to praise his hockey sense. He sees the ice very well as a playmaker, but his ability to make quick, creative and correct decisions consistently helps him make a dangerous two-way force. Suzuki can make a difficult open-ice dangle or a quick chip to get the puck up and to the right spot. Defensively, he's solid on his positional play, winning battles without taking penalties, and he is a shorthanded scoring threat to boot. His skating technique isn't sublime, but I wouldn't categorize him as slow -- maybe just a little awkward in how his feet get him where he's going. However, his top speed is fine. At the end of the day, he's one of the smartest players in the draft, and that means a lot when projecting a player into the NHL. However, given his subpar size and skating, that means he'll be another data point in the experiment of how far elite smarts can take you.",,,,"Insanely intelligent, but has the work ethic to match. A non-stop motor at both ends. Offensive upside is underrated. He's just a really good all-around player who deserves to be a lottery selection IMO. ",,,"Suzuki is an intelligent and highly-skilled 200-foot
dynamic playmaker. His speed is solid and he shows
quick lateral agility and balance. His dynamic stickhandling ability allows him to create time and space for
himself while he waits for passing lanes to open up or his
teammates to get into position. His hands also allow him to
get into the danger scoring areas with the puck and create
opportunities to finish.
He possesses incredible hand-eye coordination. He is a
dangerous playmaker who makes skilled and creative nolook, saucer passes right on his target's tape with a very
nonchalant-like poise. Suzuki's ability to just know where
everyone is on the ice is mesmerizing to watch. His shot
just jumps off his blade. He is really dangerous on the PP,
quarterbacking from inside the circle. Despite his lack of
ideal size, he does have a physical side and doesn't hestitate
in throwing hits on much bigger players to finish his checks
all over the ice.
He is a heads-up defensive player who works hard on the
backcheck and is almost always the first forward back to
help support the defense. His ability to lift his opponent's
stick and steal pucks is impressive as he is able to regain
possession and within second's transitions back onto the
offensive attack. He is solid in the face-off dot, showing
quick hands and good technique.
Suzuki is a smaller forward, not the size that NHL teams like
to draft in the first round. He attempts to do too much on
his own at times. He can have stretches where he holds onto
the puck too long, not using the available open passing
lane. His shot accuracy is literally hit or miss. He directs a ton
of shots at the net so improving the consistency of his accuracy will obviously make him more dangerous as a finisher.
Suzuki also has these episodes that leave you scratching
your head -- he stays out on the perimeter at times and is
engaged and driving through traffic for opportunities at
others.
His skating also needs work. Ineffective, choppy strides
make Suzuki look like he's putting in a lot of effort when
skating through open ice. His skating and quickness in small
spaces is strong, but when he opens it up it can look pretty
inefficient. Even still Suzuki does manage to generate solid
levels of speed making us think that if he improved his
stride he could really fly and be even more of an effective
200-foot player."
2017,D,76,214.98,14,TBL,,Callan Foote,"Big defensemen with skill aren't easy to find, and that's why Foote -- Adam Foote's son, for those concerned with bloodlines -- will make himself a valuable asset on draft day. He stands 6-foot-4, has above-average puck skills, sees the ice well and was a pillar for Kelowna this season, quarterbacking their top power-play unit. He's coordinated for a player his size when handling the puck, and he can make deft touch plays when under pressure. His defense is fine. He uses his frame to win battles and has adequate defensive sense. Given his size and offensive skill, he'll be a competent two-way defenseman as a pro. I don't love his skating, particularly his first step, and that's what keeps him from being a true upper-echelon prospect.",,,,,,,"Foote is a big-framed, rangy, smart defender with a
strong shot. The son of former NHLer Adam Foote, he
plays a traditional, steady, two-way game that first
and foremost keeps opponents honest in his own zone but
can also make a good first pass. Foote is a tad heavy footed
when skating forward however his backwards skating is
much better in both quickness and agility.
He moves well enough to not be beaten clean to pucks,
even by speedier forwards. He has an NHL frame and while
he isn't a punishing player, he does use his size effectively to
defend the net and box out attackers. He is especially adept
at using his size and reach to break up the cycle game. He's
not a perfect player at all times, as there are definitely lapses
to his game, but he always bounces right back and responds
by playing harder and working to shore up play in his own
end. He has a massive wing span and is good at closing gaps
on his defenders, using his physicality to not only eliminate
plays along the perimeter but also at the net front and in the
end boards too.
He plays to his strengths, which entails keeping himself in
an advantageous position defensively to read and square
up attackers so they aren't on top of him before he can
react. He's not a dynamic skill guy and rarely rushes the puck
from his own end, going often with the simple pass to a
forward to enter the neutral zone. At even strength you see
him play a more defensive oriented game where he's really
conservative to join the play up ice until zone possession
is gained. Offensively, he is able to knock away breakout
attempts and is able to hold the blue line to his advantage.
He has great vision with the puck on the ice and is able to
find the open lanes for quick, crisp breakout passes. Foote
walks the line effectively trying to find the open lane for the
shot.
There's nothing particularly wrong with Foote's game, but
he does need to improve his mobility when it comes to
acceleration and agility. He is a large kid, with some heavy
boots, who takes a while to get going. While his defensive
game has progressed well, we were hoping for a lot more
progression (offensively) this season. He really struggled
with puck movement at the start of this season, at times not
even looking for his teammates, instead being content to
just drive it off the glass and out.
We saw plenty of flashes of his two-way ability last year but
this year he withdrew into more of a defensive shell. He
does plays all situations though and although we don't see
a point-producer at the NHL level, we do see a player who
could potentially play middle pairing minutes if the footspeed improves."
2017,D,69,179,15,VGK,,Erik Brannstrom,"Brannstrom is a favorite of mine relative to the opinions of many scouts. I've been very impressed the past two to three seasons, and I think he has a good pro ceiling. He's a small defenseman at 5-foot-10, but he does a lot well. Brannstrom is a great skater, is gifted on his edges and has a good top gear. He can make plays in open ice because though his puck skills aren't fantastic, they are solid, and his feet and great vision allow him to make a lot happen. His defense could use a little tweaking, as I've seen him make errors he shouldn't, but he has still displayed the ability to play tough minutes. Despite the occasional gaffe, his hockey IQ shines most shifts. Although he is small, Brannstrom has an edge to his game as well.",,,,"While small, he excels at the game in the modern style of NHL defenseman. An excellent skater, high hockey IQ and offensive vision, runs the PP and creates transition offence. An underrated prospect with high fantasy upside.",,,"Brannstrom is a smaller, puck-moving blueliner with
high-end creativity and hockey sense. He is an
excellent skater, very agile and slippery with
impressive lateral mobility; able to escape pressure with a
quick change of direction. He moves with purpose and likes
to have the puck on his stick.
He has great poise and tremendous vision with the puck on
his blade. He makes great outlet passes and has the ability
to run a power play. He is a good puck-mover and he also
boasts a heavy point shot for a little guy. Brannstrom makes
great reads at both ends, knows when to get involved
offensively and when it is best to hang back. On defense, he
is extremely smart, making great reads and keeping a good
gap on his check. He positions his stick and body well to
contain opposing players, angle them wide and away from
the net. He is strong on the walls, and despite being smaller
he is strong for his size and able to successfully separate
players from the puck with his lower center of gravity to act
as a bit of a shield.
He's a finesse defenseman, who in a short order can skate
back, retrieve the puck from his end, raise his head up,
quickly scan all his options before making a decision
whether to skate the puck out of from his own end or opt
for the breakout pass. Very poised and calm in the face of
forechecking pressure. He always looks to be one or two
steps ahead of the play, knowing where to be before the
puck gets there.
His biggest flaw is undoubtedly his size. At only 5-10, he has
a hard time battling against bigger opponents in front of his
crease or even along the wall. He would be well served to hit
the weight room in between trips to the closest all-you-caneat buffet in an attempt to add twenty pounds of muscle.
Not likely a guy who will be in the NHL anytime soon as he
will need some seasoning.
Despite some of his flaws, he plays a very mature game that
will only improve as he continues to play against men in
the SHL. Brannstrom plays with a lot of swagger, but that
confidence in his capabilities can be a double-edged sword,
as he can try some dangerous passes and plays with the
puck as the last man back. In the NHL, those plays will not
be allowed or tolerated."
2017,D,73.5,211.27,16,CGY,,Juuso Valimaki,"Valimaki has been a leading player in his age group for years, and he was excellent this season for Tri-City in the WHL. He's a very well-rounded defenseman. Valmaki stands 6-foot-2, 200 pounds, but skates like a 5-foot-11 player, with an easy, powerful stride. His puck skills aren't dynamic, but he has decent hands to couple with very good offensive instincts. He moves the puck quite well and can project as a potential second-unit power-play man in the pros. I've been more impressed with his offensive instincts in the WHL than I have been in international play for Finland. Defensively, he's a rock, with ability to close gaps with his speed, in addition to winning a lot of battles and making smart, simple plays.",,,,"Big, minute-eating blueliner who can run a power play and work well with speedy forwards. Valimaki's size and play with the man-advantage will all but assure him an NHL job, plus he likes to shoot the puck.",,,"Valimaki is a fluid puck-mover that shows a creative
knack in the offensive zone and plays a strong
defensive game. A smooth-skating, two-way
defender who excels with not only finesse but in his ability
to play a heavy and reliable defensive game.
He moves extremely well for his size and can absolutely fly
at an impressive tempo when he wants to apply pressure.
One of smartest player on the ice, Valimaki used his
unflappable persona and high-end puck-moving skills to
pick apart his opponents methodically. His ability to move
or skate the puck makes him a dual threat from the backend as calm and confident player. He has a great release on
his preferred wrist shot and is able to find holes to the net
by mere inches, all due to his precision and ability to keep
his head engaged with the target.
His options are never limited and he's too clever to defend
comprehensively. He is a boulder on the back-end and not
a player who coughs up the puck or gets steamrolled in
battles or off the rush. While not an overly aggressive player,
he gets in opponents' heads by not relinquishing an inch of
free ice and consistently causing frustration with his ability
to remain in great position to separate his man from the
puck.
 His ability to defend the rush is superior and he knows
when and where to make his move on the puck carrier,
courting them into a check or a sweeping away the puck
when a viable opening presents itself. He constantly gets
into shooting lanes and seldom let pucks get through
him to the net, letting his shin pads take the brunt. He has
the awareness of his own zone, knowing not to block his
goaltender's sight lines while retreating into coverage. He
is a heady player that contributes on special teams and can
play heavy minutes while five on five.
Valimaki has slow feet, like most defensemen of bigger
stature. He has a hard time containing faster, shifty, attackers
although he has shown he can make up for this with active
feet and intelligent situational reads. His skating limits his
lateral mobility and ability to defend some situations, but
this is an area of this game which he will have time to work
on. He also lacks nasty edge or the dominating physical
element that you want to see in a big bodied defenseman.
He does not make his opponent pay a price for going to his
crease or when the big check presents itself, instead just
choosing to tie his man up. He has the potential to become
a future top four guy but will need to add a bit of nastiness
to his toolbox to be a solid pro"
2017,D,71.5,188,17,TML,,Timothy Liljegren,"Liljegren missed a sizeable chunk of the season due to mono. When healthy, he's one of the most dynamic offensive defensemen of the past few draft classes. You can tell when Liljegren has the puck. ""He was able to quarterback a SHL power play when he was 16. You just don't see that,"" noted one scout. He's quite creative and quite skilled. He can make the in-tight plays and control the puck in ways that distinguish him as a puck mover. LIljegren skates very well and can get up in a rush, but it's his skill and offensive mind that elevate him to the highest levels. Although he's a very imaginative and effective puck mover, he can get himself into trouble. He gives the puck away a lot going for the one extra play. His defense isn't elite, but it's decent, as he can make a check and not get completely killed in his own end without the puck; however, there are times when he is a clear negative on that side on the puck.",,,,"Smooth skating, offensive defender has plenty of raw skills, however a down season has seen his stock drop. His skating is supreme, but decision-making is a concern. How much leeway does suffering from mono a year ago get him? High-risk, high-reward player. ",,,"Liljegren is a flashy offensive puck-mover on the
back-end who exhibits high-end skating ability. He
gets to top speed in just a couple powerful strides and
possesses impressive multi-directional mobility. Liljegren
displays elite puck-moving skills and carries the puck with
a confidence and an elegance which is not often seen in a
player his age. He tries to always position himself for a pass
and is often ready to receive one himself.
He has great hand-skills and creativity for a defenseman. He
is able to dance around opposition to get into the offensive
zone. He has a cool head in high pressure situations and
distributes accurate passes even when time is limited.
Setting up breakout plays from behind his own net and
making crisp passes out of his own end, he pinches to keep
pucks in the zone and drives deep for scoring opportunities.
Defensively he attacks the puck carrier immediately along
the boards and uses great gap control and an active stick to
take away scoring chances. Although he is not the biggest
player, he is hard to beat along the boards as he is balanced
on his skates and does not quit on plays, but rather leans
hard towards opponents using all of his frame to win battles.
He does not give the puck carrier much time and is always
present with an active stick. Liljegren isn't overly physical
but he shows a good tenaciousness in board battles and he
doesn't back down. He utilizes explosive skating to close off
opponents' lanes and chase down attackers effectively.
A prospect that looked so promising last season, Liljegren
hasn't progressed at the same rate as many others in this
draft class. While he has many excellent individual skills like
his elite skating, offensive creativity and puck-moving, the
big problem is that he leaves you questioning his smarts.
He often lets the correct play pass by, instead choosing the
play or pass option with less chance of success. He also has
a tendency to hold onto the puck too long at times and gets
forced into low percentage plays. There have been instances
where his nervousness and puck mishandling deep in his
own end have gotten him in trouble as opposing forecheckers closed the gap on him and caused a turnover.
He tries to do too much at times, forcing things, pinching at
inopportune times for the puck, getting his long range passes cut and causing turnovers. At other times, he is too selfish
with the puck and wants to do everything by himself, only
passing the puck as a last resort. This, as a result, can put his
teammates into uncomfortable situations."
2017,D,72.5,188.2,18,BOS,,Urho Vaakanainen,"Vaakanainen has been on the prospect radar for many years. While he didn't have the draft season he may have hoped for, he still showed well at various points and remains a coveted player. Vaakanainen has excellent two-way hockey sense. He's a smooth, creative puck mover who can dictate tempo and QB a power play due to his vision and a good slap shot. His skating isn't explosive, but he has an easy stride, with the ability to evade pressure and get around the ice. Defensively, he's solid. He can use his body to win battles and play a sound positional game, closing his gaps effectively. If he gets back to the development track he was on when he was 15 and 16 years old, he could be a great pro.",,,,,,,"Vaakanainen is a positionally-sound defender who
does not have much flash to his game but is
ultra-safe and reliable in his own zone. He has
composure and is aware of what's happening all over the
ice. Vaakanainen is a good skater who has a low center of
gravity, generates good power from each stride, and has
great four-way mobility. He is able to accelerate to top
speed quickly, has the balance to transition to backwardsskating smoothly, and can move laterally without losing
much speed.
Vaakanainen has sound puck skills and shows the ability
to make a strong first pass to start a breakout. He has the
ability to carry the puck, but doesn't do it very often. His
shot from the point has a quick release and he picks good
spots for a shot. He does a good job avoiding forecheckers
when going back into his own zone to retrieve the puck,
shifting his weight well to absorb the hit while making a
good play on the puck.
On defense, he has good awareness and plays strong
positionally, doing a good job reading opposing players
along the wall and choosing when to apply physical
pressure. He's not a big hitter through the neutral zone, but
he's not afraid to throw his weight around in the defensive
zone to separate his man from the puck. He is more than
willing to make the simple play to relieve defensive zone
pressure by chipping the puck out instead of trying to force
a pass to a covered teammate. What stands out as a real
strength is Vaakanainen's excellent gap control. He has no
issues keeping up with rushing attackers and frequently
interrupted plays, thanks to a perfectly tight gap and an
active stick.
Vaakanainen is a guy that will need to add some mass and
functional strength before he can be effective at the NHL
level. He could improve his shot power by being patient
and taking the time to set his feet before shooting. In the
defensive zone, Vaakanainen had moments where he didn't
seem aware of what was going on around him, displayed
bad anticipation in some situations and was slow to get
back into position after getting drawn out by an attacker.
Luckily, those situations are random and not the norm. That
being said, if he wants to be that safe defensive-first guy he
will need to eliminate those times altogether. The frequency
with which he gets drawn out of position is slightly worrying, however he shows promise, especially thanks to his
impressive gap play, defensive awareness and ability to
defend the rush."
2017,C,72.5,188.94,19,OTT,,Josh Norris,"Norris was the top center for the USNTDP this season. He had a tough time following up previous No. 1 centers like Jack Eichel and Auston Matthews, but overall he looks like a solid prospect. Norris is a well-rounded but not outstanding player. He's got decent stick skills, above-average offensive hockey sense and can finish chances from middle distance. Norris was also one of the top penalty killers for the NTDP, and an occasional shorthanded threat. I've heard some scouts praise his skating as high-level. From what I've personally seen, I can't say he's a speedster by any means, although his skating is above average. The Michigan native is headed to Ann Arbor to be a Wolverine this fall.",,,,"Norris plays with boundless energy on both ends of the ice. A careful puck handler and shifty, fast skater, he is quite calculated with his passes and highly accurate shots.

Protects the puck well and has a nose for rebounds and greasy goals. ",,,"Norris is a solid center who

quickly and has the ability to
take defenders wide and beat
them in a foot race. He does a
good job reading the ice to set
up teammates and shows quick
decision making in finding the
best pass option around him.
He makes simple yet accurate
and effective passes. He has
a good shot but has to do a
better job of finding an open
lane before attempting a shot,
as it gets blocked a lot leading
to the puck clearing the zone.
He is strong on puck and works
like a mule, does a good job
protecting the puck with his
body, making him tough to
deal with along the boards and
effective in the cycle game. He
has the speed and strength to
drive to the net from the wing,
creating chances by carrying
the puck to the low slot area. He
has good upper-body strength

hit to create turnovers, as well
as shut down opposing cycle
games in the defensive zone. He
doesn't have high-end offensive
potential, but his two-way game

He's a very smart and very skilled center. His coordination and creativity with the puck are top-notch, and he consistently moves the puck into good spaces to generate chances. Thomas can also be quite effective on the defensive side of the puck, despite his smaller frame, and he was one of London's better penalty-killers this season. He could be marginally faster for a player his size, but I think he skates fine and will be competent in that area as a pro. Don't let his somewhat underwhelming counting stats fool you; buried behind top Sabres prospect Cliff Pu as the Knights' No. 2 center this season, Thomas can be an impactful player.",,,,"Highly skilled playmaker who has tremendous vision.

continues to get stronger."
2017,C,73.5,191.66,21,NYR,,Filip Chytil,"Chytil was a regular in the top Czech league as a bottom-six forward for his team, despite being one of the youngest players eligible for the 2017 draft. It was hard for me to get a read on Chytil this season. On the one hand, I see a player with a fair amount of talent. On the other, I never saw him take over a game when playing against his age group, and he was often the best player on the second-best line more than being a game-changer. Chytil is an impressive skater who can be tough to check when he's coming through the neutral zone with speed. His stick skills are above average, and I watched him create chances out of nothing. He moves the puck around fine and is creative offensively. Off the puck, I'd like to see more from him in terms of grit and awareness.",,,,,,,"Chytil is a speedy player
with good hockey sense
and offensive skill. He is
a very good skater, with very
quick feet and balance on
his edges that allows him to
generate good power from
every stride and high-end
acceleration in his first few
steps. He uses his speed well to
carry the puck up ice, into the
offensive zone, stopping up
along the outside and setting
up for some offensive zone
time. His vision of the ice helps
him to quickly find open lanes
to go through with the puck
and once moving he is hard to
contain when he finds space.
Has decent puck skills, although
nothing too electrifying, and is
able to receive and dish passes
at full speed without breaking
stride. He is stronger than his
size would indicate, hard to
knock off the puck showing
tremendous puck protection,
goes into dirty areas and
wins most of his puck battles
alongside the board. He is also
very active on the forechecking
and his long reach helps him
to steal the puck from his
opponents. He is very sneaky.
It is not uncommon to see him
work deep in both zones and
even throw a hit or two, as he
wants to make his presence felt.
Chytil is a guy you will need to
have patience with as he takes a
few seasons to add strength, but
he could be well worth it."
2017,RW,67.5,146.4,22,EDM,,Kailer Yamamoto,"It takes a lot of talent for teams to be convinced that a player under 5-foot-8 should go in the top 15, but Yamamoto clears that bar, partly on talent alone, and partly on a relatively weak draft class. He's a plus skater, puck handler and passer. Yamamoto has great agility on his edges, combined with a good top gear. He can create when he is carrying the puck due to his skill, creativity and ability to see the ice. He can come down the wing with speed one shift and quarterback a power play the next. At the WHL level as an 18-year-old, he showed he could be decent defensively, but the main concern going forward is how will he do away from the puck at his size. I have reasonable concerns about that. However, there is still a lot of promise in his game.",,,,"He has great awareness, quick hands and solid speed. He continued to produce big numbers while teammate Kailer Yamamoto was on the shelf but a blanking at the U18 tournament may have some down on him. He's in line for a huge draft-plus one campaign.",,,"Yamamoto is that elite offensive talent packed into
a very small frame. He has a big heart and plays the
game with very high energy; a very quick and shifty
player whose feet are constantly moving. Yamamoto has
multitude of skating gears that he can utilize to adjust the
pace of an attack quickly.
His outside speed and ability to maintain puck control while
accelerating and slipping through lanes on the ice allows
him to create a lot of opportunities and do some special
things with the puck. His speed, with or without the puck,
is identical due to his very good puck handling and control.
His agility also allows him to get in and out of high traffic
areas as well as dance around opposing players and checks.
His slick hands, agility and first step acceleration give him
the ability to snap opponent's ankles with a dizzying flurry
of moves. He has elite vision on the ice and with his creative
passing ability he finds passing lanes and can set up great
scoring chances.
On top of his slick playmaking skill, he has a shot that is
quick off his stick and carries a load of power for the limited
size he has. He has developed into a respectable defensive
player with his alertness and quick reactionary time, using
his quickness and senses to disrupt a lot of pucks. He is
strong on the backcheck as well as into his own zone and
isn't shy to provide support.
He uses his quick hands to easily strip opponents off the
puck and transitions quickly back on offense for a scoring
chance. This is a player who plays both the power play and
the penalty kill and is effective on both sides of the puck. He
is the most dangerous player on the ice on most shifts.
A small and weaker winger, Yamamoto gets knocked off the
puck easily as he lacks both upper and lower-body strength
needed to be successful in puck protection or board battles.
He does utilize his quickness well but in reality he is one big
crushing check away from the long-term IR. This makes him
a risky high pick but one that could have NHL teams kicking
themselves if he becomes the next Jonny Gaudreau or Martin St. Louis. He doesn't play a physical game and really will
have that uphill battle going forward.
However he is a multifaceted player who answers questions about his size with a tenacious work ethic and great
awareness to avoid being hemmed into a disadvantageous
situation. Added mass will also make him more dangerous
off the rush as his already quick and accurate shot could use
added velocity when firing from farther out which will come
from improved upper-body strength. "
2017,D,74.25,163.04,23,ARI,,Pierre-Olivier Joseph,"Joseph is a talented defenseman and the brother of Tampa prospect Mathieu Joseph (No. 120 pick in 2015), who turned heads this season in the QMJHL. Joseph is an above-average skater with good quickness in all directions. He's a quality puck mover who can make a skilled play but is more effective when he's seeing his options develop and making a good pass. Joseph will work hard and grind, but he needs to add a lot of bulk on his frame. He's a very smart, two-way player who closes gaps quickly and tends to not hurt his own team with his decision-making. NHL scouts that I talk to about him note that he might be a long-term type of player, but his upside has warranted discussion of him being picked fairly early.",,,,,,,"Joseph is a puck-moving
defenseman that pushes
the play forward. He
skates well with good agility
and balance. He is not afraid
to use every pound he has
to hit his opponents, first to
separate them from the puck
and then to set the physical
tone. His long reach is an asset
in the defensive zone as is his
gap control, keeping in stick
range and not biting on any
stickhandling moves. With the
puck on his blade, he activates
and naturally moves towards
the attacking net while his
eyes scour the ice looking for
his options. He makes accurate
short, medium, or stretch
passes but could use more
strength on the longer dishes
as they can be intercepted.
He handles the puck with soft
hands and receives sharp passes
without juggling. He reads
and anticipates play very well,
supporting the play in all zones.
He defends well in one-on-one
situations, playing the man and
not the puck due to his great
mobility and hockey smarts. His
shot will need improvement as
it lacks power and is more of a
glorified pass at the moment.
He transitions from picking the
puck up in his own zone to full
out offensive attack in a blink
and generates quality scoring
chances. NHL teams will likely
see the upside in his puckmoving skillset and character"
2017,RW,75,209.22,24,WPG,,Kristian Vesalainen,"Vesalainen split time between the SHL and Liiga as he struggled to establish himself at either level as a 17-year-old, but he ended his season on a strong note, as he was named the MVP of the IIHF under-18 championship. His poor regular season aside, he has a lot of promise as an NHL prospect. Players his size who can jet as well as Kristian does are hard to find. He's a player whose speed makes him incredibly dangerous, given his long wingspan, and he has great puck skills. He won't be a premier playmaker but is able to generate quite a bit of offense from his creativity, speed and ability to drive the high-percentage areas. His game needs to round out a lot, though. He isn't that great defensively, and though he can play a power game, he needs to work on being more consistent in loose puck battles.",,,,"Blessed with great size and skating ability, a poor WJC tournament for himself and most of the Fins has dropped his stock but a monster U18 tourney had scouts salivating once again. He possesses the potential to be a top-end power forward at the next level.",,,"Vesalainen is a prospect with plenty of tools in the
toolbox as a big bodied, offensive-minded forward
who makes an impact when he uses his size and
speed to his advantage. He has solid skating ability, with
power and balance on his edges helping him transition
and pivot while maintaining healthy speeds. He has good
acceleration in small areas and opens himself up well for
the pass. Vesalainen has impressive puck skills for a bigger
player, showing the ability to handle a hard pass and make
skilled dekes at high speed.
He is a powerful skater who can drive through defensemen
with the puck on his stick, protecting it with his reach and
strength before making a sharp cut towards the slot for
a scoring chance. He has the ability to single-handedly
generate chances in the offensive zone. He explores
pass options at the right time and quickly makes up his
mind about when and where to distribute the puck. He
is dangerous working along the boards utilizing his large
frame and strength to win battles. He's constantly buzzing
in the offensive zone looking for gaps and soft spots in
coverage, waiting for a pass before unloading a heavy
shot. He is very aggressive on the forecheck, leaving his
opponents little time to make plays. He has an active stick
that he constantly uses to interrupt passes.
He is equally quick and aggressive on the backcheck, forcing
a couple of early turnovers as one of the first players back.
Once in the defensive zone, Vesalainen displays excellent
positioning, constantly clogging passing lanes and covering
the blue line. He shows decent awareness in coming low
into the corner to support his defenders in puck battles
along the wall. Vesalainen is a player with so much promise
and projectable upside, but he doesn't always make a
difference on either side of the puck. Inconsistent effort has
been his big hurdle and what has caused him to slide from
lottery consideration earlier in the year to this spot in our
rankings.
He looks too lax or lazy at times. He has a tendency to glide
through cornering and loop around the zone instead of
starting and stopping to get pack into the play. His effort
and drive must improve so that he can consistently be the
guy carrying the play. While his defensive game still needs
some work and his consistency really needs to be ironed
out, Vesalainen's speed, size, and offensive skill should still
make him an alluring prospect in a weaker draft this year."
2017,C,73.75,176.55,25,MON,,Ryan Poehling,"Poehling was one of the most impressive players at the Ivan Hlinka tournament last summer, and he was good for the USA's under-18 team in the spring. As one of the youngest players in college hockey this season, he was decent at times, with the inconsistencies expected in a 17-year-old playing against young men in their early 20s. Poehling is a smart playmaker down the middle, who can score as well. He displays good hand-eye coordination, consistently makes above-average skill plays and can play with pace. His skating isn't fantastic but shows at an average level. Defensively, he thinks the game fine, but a thin frame limits his ability to win battles despite a willingness to compete.",,,,,,,"Poehling is a big, solid, two-way center who infuses
power aspects into his game. He's a big bodied center
who has his fingers all over the offensive playbook for
his team. While not a speed skating champion, he moves
effectively enough to excel on the rush and create space
with quick turns to open ice. He thinks the game at an elite
level and is equally effective at kick starting or finishing
players.
Poehling knows where he can exploit opponents on the
play and makes the best choice to get the puck on net.
He loves the back door play, streaking behind the defense
to redirect the puck off a pass on net. Gets shots off his
stick quickly and can hit the smallest of windows with his
accuracy. He consistently does a great job passing the
puck with the vision to land the puck at its destination
without much deliberation. Poehling has a skilled stick but
most of the time you don't see him trying to dance around
opponents with flashy dekes, instead he is one to just put
his head down, bear down and power his way to where he
wants to get to. He displays a nose for the net to finish plays
off and creates his own chances.
Has a physical edge to him and shows that he will lay a
devastating check to send a message or even drop the
mitts if need be. He is a very mature, smart player with great
awareness and hockey sense. He takes good angles to pucks
and is constantly involved in the play. He possesses excellent
two-way ability with his positioning on the defensive side
of the puck, mirroring the offensive zone smarts he also
possesses.
He uses his physicality to extinguish chances and shows a
hunger for recovering pucks in board battles or simply by
stripping his opponent with a quick stick. He will lay himself
on the line to make plays and is a selfless leader in the
trenches. Poehling plays with a team-first attitude and it's
easy to see the quality character he carries.
Poehling is a big kid who has plenty going for him. However,
he will need to add about twenty or thirty pounds of muscle
to maximize his frame. We do not see him as having a high
offensive potential at the NHL level, but is more suited for a
secondary scoring role. He also needs to work on improving
his skating skills, as he is a little slow off the mark. That being
said, we do believe NHL teams are likely to consider him,
sooner rather than later."
2017,G,76.25,218.34,26,DAL,,Jake Oettinger,"Oettinger, who has been a big-name prospect for years, was nothing short of fantastic as a freshman at BU, being named a second team All-Star in Hockey East. He stands tall and looks like a pro in the net with a refined technique, good positional play and the ability to consistently absorb pucks. While he's not a dynamic, athletic type of goalie, Oettinger has solid to average ability to make lateral saves, and has decent footwork. He's not perfect yet -- as is the case with many 19-year-old goalies -- as he occasionally overcommits on his slides and lets in some soft ones, but overall he's pretty advanced in many critical areas for a player his age.",,,,,,,"Oettinger is that athletic goaltender with size that
gets NHL teams excited. He has a great frame to
naturally cover the net and impressive agility and
mobility to keep position effectively. Oettinger has had
quite a successful rookie season starting for the Terriers, one
of the nation's top college teams.
He has good technical form and is quick to drop down into
the butterfly position. He has a strong lower-body, powerful
leg pushes, and is quick to move side to side. He doesn't
often over-commit when moving from side to side and does
a good job staying square to the shooter when moving
laterally. His ability to stay big and mobile in his net when
he's moving to the side is beneficial to his rebound control,
as he is able to steer pucks towards the corner by using his
stick. He has that swagger about him that makes it seem as
though he is up to any task and won't get demoralized in
tough times.
He is very alert in the net and not often caught napping on
plays around the net. Oettinger has a quick glove hand and
is able to snare pucks from the scoring areas before they
become dangerous. He sees play development and also
knows how to help out his defensemen by opportunistically
leaving the net, playing the puck and helping his team
transition.
He is rangy and does a good job anticipating when to come
out of his net, but struggles to get power on his passes and
doesn't seem to have the range to clear the puck to center
ice. Oettinger has the athleticism to be unconventional and
simply throw style out the window, throwing his body at
pucks when necessary.
A tall and somewhat lanky kid, Oettinger has some room to
add muscle to his frame. He doesn't have many weaknesses and still has room to grow into his huge frame. The one
weakness we noted this season is his tendency to struggle
picking up the puck with traffic in front of him, a common
problem for the taller goaltenders when they are younger.
He needs to make sure he is moving around the obstacles
and getting low enough to see the puck consistently. Lastly,
his glove can be both impressive and a letdown at times. He
does not always cleanly catch pucks as he tends to fumble
them on lower shots, sometimes causing a preventable
rebound. His consistency needs to improve."
2017,C,70.75,172.96,27,PHI,,Morgan Frost,"Frost showed significant development in his 17-year-old season, being a top player for the Greyhounds. His hockey sense is what stands out to me. Frost is a great playmaker who is often a primary creator of scoring chances. While he's great when he has the puck on his stick in general, I'd like to see him improve away from the puck. He also isn't a fierce competitor in puck battles. Moreover, his skating doesn't look explosive. His top gear is just OK, though he shows great agility and burst in his first few steps. I see a lot of potential in Frost's game, but he'll need time to round out some of those deficiencies.",,,,"Frost possesses buttery soft hands with crafty playmaking ability. Accused of playing too much on the perimeter at times, the 5-11 centre manages to produce through exceptional offensive instincts, often finding the quiet, high-danger areas of the ice. ",,,"Frost is extremely gifted,
and possesses a high
hockey IQ. He is a better
playmaker than a goal-scorer
but can do both. He makes
difficult passes look extremely
simple, is very gifted with the
puck on his stick, and has the
ability to pick corners and bury
the puck with ease. He is agile
on his skates and possesses
excellent edgework, enabling
him to cut in and out of
defenders quickly to create and
finish plays. His superior vision
serves him well as he dishes the
puck, combined with his slick
hands, it can be a deadly blend.
He has an incredibly accurate
stick that he uses to poke the
puck off of opponents sticks, dig
out of piles of players, and picks
off passes. Part of his turnover
ability comes from speedy
skating and solid positioning.
He never stops skating, allowing
him to generate speed quickly
and get to where the puck is
going to be or where the play
is beginning to develop. He
also has improved his skating
ability over the course of the
season, and has turned into
a true threat every time he
steps out on the ice. Smart
and tenacious are the two best
ways to describe Frost's game.
Defensively, he has sound
positioning and is rarely static
on the ice. Frost has great
potential as a small but very
skilled player. "
2017,C,73.5,178.28,28,OTT,,Shane Bowers,"Bowers has been a name to know for several years when he was coming up as a bantam in Halifax, and he had a very solid second USHL season. Bowers is a great skater, with an easy first few steps. He works hard to pressure defensemen and can play on both sides of the ice. The ultimate question with Bowers is his offensive ceiling. Some scouts I talk to swear by him as a potential frontline NHL player; other scouts, including me, question whether he'll be able to score much as an NHLer. That isn't to say Bowers can't make high-level offensive plays. He has good hands and vision and was more consistent in that regard in the second half of the season. Bowers is committed to Boston University starting in the 2017-18 season.",,,,"Bowers has proven a hardworking player who excels in all zones and uses explosive bursts of speed to create distance from opposing defenders. Willing to play tough in the corners and elsewhere, it takes a lot to knock him off the puck. Shows impressive hockey smarts and a gritty defensive game that accents his effective all-around play.",,,"Bowers is a strong two-way center with solid hockey
sense and an excellent compete-level. He is a very
good skater, a skill that defines his game. He has very
quick feet and accelerates very well with quick crossovers,
making him very good in tight spaces, carrying the puck
with pace.
Bowers is effective around the net and a constant threat
offensively. He drives the net without the puck and gets
himself in position for deflections or rebound chances. He
protects the puck very well when he drives through traffic
and does not give defenders much chance to knock it away.
He has decent speed with the puck and escapability from
defenders with one or two quick extra steps laterally while
already moving at high speed. Bowers is a tenacious, strong
puck-handler with smooth hands and an understanding of
when to use them and when to execute a simpler, safer play
to be effective.
He has a deceptive release on his shot and can get it off very
quickly from anywhere in the offensive zone. He is typically
on the ice for a lot of key face-offs and wins the majority
of them. Bowers possesses strong vision and makes good
feeds to his teammates to create chances. He gets himself
into good position to support his teammates or for a return
pass. He may not become a huge scorer at the NHL level,
but his two-way acumen, great skating and puck skills, and
consistent effort make him a safe bet to fully develop into
his potential.
Bowers is a bit vanilla when it comes to his offensive game
as he lacks flash or creativity and takes only what is available
in front of him. We were hot and cold on him this season, as
his consistency left something to be desired. He would have
a string of games where he looked extremely strong, constantly involved in all facets and contributing on the score
sheet and then there where games where you had to check
the lineup sheet to see if he was even playing. He has a very
upright stride, suggesting he could improve his speed if he
got lower to the ice and got more power in his strides. It's
an aspect that isn't of a significant concern, however, with a
little bit of work.
He's still somewhat undersized, but he fights in the corners
and uses his strength to protect the puck well. The good
thing is he will have plenty of time to hit the weight room
as he is slated to join Boston University for two-to-four years
next fall."
2017,D,70.75,187.9,29,CHI,,Henri Jokiharju,"Jokiharju started off a little slow as he adjusted to hockey life in North America, but he made the transition and was very good in Portland as a WHL rookie. I've always been impressed by his skill set and think he has significant NHL upside. He's a great skater and one of the more mobile defenders available in this class. He's a smart, two-way defenseman who can dictate tempo and move the puck efficiently. I don't think his skill is top-end level, but he's going to be able to rack up a lot of points thanks to his vision, feet and decision-making. Despite not being a big guy, Jokiharju is quite effective defensively because he's very smart with his positional play.",,,,,,,"Jokiharju is a puck-rushing
and attacking defender

and speed that make him a
consistent offensive threat.
His skating is top notch and
his balance and power allow
him to weave his way and
make agile moves to enter the
offensive zone. His puck skill
is top notch and he is able to
dangle the puck on a string. His
vision is top tier and he gets
pucks to teammates through
tight coverage. Jokiharju is a
key cog in creating offensive
chances. He actively pinches off
the line with good mobility and
hand-eye to keep the play in the

decisions and showcasing
his blazing speed to get back

2017,RW,69.25,189.48,30,NSH,,Eeli Tolvanen,"Simply put, Tolvanen has produced everywhere he has gone. In my opinion, he was the best player in the USHL this season, and he has looked very good in international play for Finland the past few seasons. Tolvanen is known mostly for his big-time shot, which makes him one of the more feared goal-scorers in this year's class. However, he is more than a shooter. Tolvanen has great hands, can make difficult feeds and can play at a quick pace, though he is most comfortable when winding up his cannon. He's small and not incredibly quick for a player his size (though I think his skating is adequate), but he's smart enough to put himself in position to score and has a little physical edge to his game too. He's committed to Boston College for 2017-18.",,,,"Some feel he is the most electric USHL player in the past decade and is the purest shooter in the draft. Despite the smaller stature, he isn't afraid to fight his way into scoring areas and release a wicked shot. He changes the angle on his release and draws opposition defenders near, thus opening passing lanes for teammates. Throw in his elite speed and you've got a legit fantasy prospect. He will need to clean up the defensive side before locking down an NHL gig. ",,,"Tolvanen is a naturally talented goal-scorer. He is a
good skater who lacks in the top-end speed
department but has elite acceleration and burst from
a standing position. He works hard along the boards and
knows how to protect himself from physical contact, while
maintaining possession of the puck. He is dangerous with
the puck in the offensive zone and has the awareness to find
open space, giving himself enough time to get off a shot.
Tolvanen's shot is arguably his best offensive weapon.
With an absolute rifle for a shot, very strong and accurate,
he doesn't require much space to generate good power
and accuracy. Additionally, he displays great vision and
passing ability, especially distributing the puck to the open
option on the power play, and also on zone-entry attempts.
Tolvanen is very smart around the net, constantly getting
open, letting good shots go and anticipating any rebounds.
He's a legitimate threat from the wing on the power play
and possesses a good one-timer on cross-crease passes.
Tolvanen remains a shoot-first player, a dangerous offensive
catalyst, he has a great sense of where to be on the ice, with
and without the puck.
He loves to be in control of the puck and possesses a slick
set of hands and shifty feet that allow him to fool the
opposition in all areas of the ice. The weapons that Tolvanen
has in is arsenal are astounding when it comes to playing
inside the oppositions blue line. He has the impressive
ability to move with a sense of quietness and stealth.
He has the ability to slow the game down with his patience
with the puck. Tolvanen's offensive instincts and shooting
abilities are elite. Tolvanen is gritty and aggressive for a
smaller player, and isn't afraid to use his body to separate his
man from the puck.
Smaller, not overly speedy wingers tend to have a difficult
time making the NHL, but Tolvanen has so many other
positive assets and a good energy that you can't help but
root for him and have confidence he will make the NHL. He
is a decent defensive player, and although engaged and
positioned well in the defensive zone, he has shifts where
he leaves the zone early and doesn't come far enough down
the side boards to give his defenders an option for a breakout pass.
His defensive game is still a work in progress as he has a tendency to float in the defensive zone when he's not engaged
in the play. He has shown a tendency to be complacent and
lazy when the bounces are not going his way."
2017,LW,74.5,207.18,31,STL,,Klim Kostin,"Kostin's ice time was very limited playing versus men in Russia, but he has impressed in international play the past few years; however, a shoulder injury sidelined him for a big chunk of the season, and may have hampered him in season. His skill level at his size is incredible, as he makes tough offensive plays seem easy. Kostin can stick handle in open space, but he also excels as a playmaker and can make the smart play when an option is available. There's the odd time he can get caught trying to do too much, but often he reads the ice well and can make the right decision. Kostin's skating isn't high-end, but he skates well for a player his size, showed significant improvements during the course of the past year and could be average as a pro. His off-the-puck game is fine too.",,,,Kostin is a polarizing figure; he can dominate a shift with his size and skill and then go dormant for games at a time. The fact that he refused to come over the North America despite being the top selection in the import draft only adds to the fear of the dreaded ‘Russian factor'. A boom or bust pick. ,,,"Kostin is a power-forward who has high-end
possession skills. He moves well, especially for his size.
While not a burner, he moves up and down the ice
with healthy amounts of speed, is very strong on his feet
and has a wide balanced base. His stride is deceptive in that
he isn't always churning his feet but can still gain separation
from defenders.
He is a thick kid, with NHL strength who uses his size
to dominate along the wall and down low. His hands in
tight are impressive, as is his quick shot release that he
can muster off in motion or use from afar to challenge
goaltenders. His ability as a sniper and power-forward
sometimes overshadow his all-around ability and skill as
a playmaker, but make no mistake -- he can distribute the
puck with skill and touch. He is a gifted puck-handler who
likes to dance through the offensive zone by changing
directions quickly and making swift turns with the puck on
his stick.
With his strong puck protection skills, he often manages to
drive the net from the outside without giving the defenders
any chance of separating him from the puck.
He loves to have the puck on his stick and carries it with
great patience, often waiting for the perfect passing
moment. He has a good understanding of his positioning in
the offensive zone, rotating with his linemates smoothly and
gaining body positioning in front of the net. He is engaged
and physical. In his own defensive end, he shows the
understanding that he needs to come down low in his own
zone to support his defenders and to apply back pressure.
With all the positives in his corner, high-end skill, impressive
size and strength, there is a reason he has slipped on most
draft lists. For every good shift he tends to produce, he opts
to take the lazy route and not work along the boards on
some pedestrian shifts, letting his teammates go to battle
for him while he waits in the reeds for pucks to squirt out.
There is also some lackadaisical efforts put in when coming
back defensively with the play as consistency seemed to
elude him.
Lastly he is fiery in the physical game but at times acts like a
dough head after the whistle getting his team into penalty
trouble for selfish retributory reasons. This big kid with allworld skill seems to have some maturing to do to reach his
full potential. "
2017,D,73.5,183.78,32,COL,,Conor Timmins,"Timmins can look like a rather boring player and isn't going to excite a lay observer. However, his hockey sense drives a ton of value to his game. He doesn't have ""wow""-caliber skating or puck skills, but he's one of the smartest defensemen in the CHL. Timmins is a very effective puck mover with top-level vision. You rarely see him cough up the puck, and he's so effective at quickly relieving pressure and making a good play with the puck. Defensively, he's solid because of his IQ and the way he battles to win pucks, though he needs to continue to bulk up. I see a player who can be used in many situations and could be a solid pro overall but lacks the upside to be a foundational piece.",,,,,,,"Timmins is a puckmoving, offensive-minded
defenseman. He is
extremely effective at moving
the puck up the ice, using his
balance and ability to accelerate
very effectively to create the
space needed to make the
correct play. He is an above
average skater, generating
healthy amounts of speed and
good burst to stay with the
play. However, his pivots and
edgework need to improve. His
mobility, combined with his
above average puck control,
allows him to take the puck
end to end, driving the offense
and taking it to the net when
the opportunity is presented.
He has a hard, accurate, very
deflectable slap shot that can be
used on the power play. He isn't
the biggest defenseman on the
ice, but he's willing to engage
physically. He's an effective
player along the boards, uses his
quick feet to get in front of the
attacking forward, and smart
stick to knock pucks loose.
He has the smarts and ability
to play at a very high level.
He needs to better position
himself to take away scoring
opportunities. He has been
get caught reaching at times or
giving away position by going
for a big hit, but it will just be a
matter of time before his game
matures and he makes better
defensive decisions to round
out his package. "
2017,RW,73,185,33,VAN,,Kole Lind,"I wasn't particularly enamored with Lind coming into the season, but he grew on me. Now I can buy him scoring in the NHL one day, due to his combination of size, speed and skill. I don't see one tool from Lind that is elite, but he does a lot well. Lind skates at an above-average level, has soft hands and can create off the rush. He sees the ice well and can beat goalies from a distance with his wrist shot, serving as the high-slot option for Kelowna's top power-play unit to launch shots and finish plays. I never see him take over a shift, but he's always generating offense in some form or fashion due to his talent, and he has the work ethic to win pucks back on the defensive end.",,,,,,,"Lind is a smooth-skating
playmaker who doesn't
mesmerize visually, but is
consistently executing good
plays. He has a solid range of
gears to his skating and can
achieve a separation speed
quickly. He plays the game at
a good place and has strong
puck protection skills, thriving in
puck possession. He is excellent
in transition and makes very
sensible choices on the rush.
He has great vision on the ice
and always finds the open
player. He knows where to be
on the ice at all times, finding
ways to get himself open for
chances on goal. He's a poised
player who doesn't wilt under
pressure. He is very good at
positioning his body to get in
the right spot and making the
adjustment necessary to get a
shot off in motion or to simply
keep possession. Lind drives
the hard areas of the ice from
the wing and has a competitive
streak that is hard to contain.
His defensive play needs a little
bit of polish as he seems to
have periods where he doesn't
grasp his role and where he
needs to be. He is reliable on
the backcheck, using his stick
to take away ice, although his
defensive game is still a work in
progress. He spent this season
proving that he can bring an
offensive presence night in and
night out, but is still viewed as a
work in progress."
2017,D,77.5,207.28,34,VGK,,Nicolas Hague,"There's a lot to like about Hague's toolkit. He's very tall, skates well, can move the puck and uses his big frame to his advantage. Digging into the details of those attributes, his skill level isn't incredibly high, but he's more than competent on the power play in terms of his playmaking, and he has a decent shot too. Hague was a shot-generating machine this season, in part due to how well he creates space with his speed, which is great for such a large player. His shot in itself is a great weapon, and he can generate goals and second chances. He's a rock defensively, arguably as good if not better than his offensive game. Hague closes his gaps well, wins battles and is often creating turnovers to get his team back up the ice quickly.",,,,,,,"Hague is a towering two-way defenseman who has
the versatility to play in all situations. He possesses
an all-around skill level that you don't see in many
defensemen with his vitals. His hands, and stick-handling
ability, are top notch and he likes to join the offensive attack,
protecting the puck with his extended reach and strength.
As an offensive weapon, he possesses an absolute rocket
of a shot which he tries to keep low and accurate, proving
opportunity for tip in and rebounds. He distributes the puck
with strong and accurate passes but is not overly creative.
He uses his frame well to block out forecheckers when going
back on retrievals. He reads and reacts to the developing
play. Defensively his long limbs combined with his long
stick, and excellent gap control, make it easy for him to
reach in on his opponents and knock the puck away from
them before they can even think about attempting to deke
around him.
He is not an overly physical player, as in he doesn't go for the
devastating open ice hit very often. This is not to say that
he shies away from physical play however, as he smothers
his opponents by angling them into a corner with good
gap control and stick work, reducing their options and
separating them from the puck.
He will stick up for himself and does quite well when he
drops the gloves. He is also tough along the boards using his
size well and will clear the crease by any means necessary.
He is a very poised and positionally sound defenseman with
solid upside.
We'll give you one guess what a 6-foot-6 blueliner might
have as a listed area for improvement. Yes - his feet. While
his speed is solid once he gets going, his first few strides
are sloppy and inefficient, making him easy to beat in puck
races for a faster opponents he faces. If an opponent is able
to chip the puck past him, they will almost assuredly win the
foot race to the puck as well.
This will need to improve for him to be impactful at the NHL
level. Hague can also panic when pressured deep in his own
zone and on occasion shows some careless handling of the
puck. He will need to clean that aspect up"
2017,C,78,200.34,35,PHI,,Isaac Ratcliffe,"Ratcliffe drew a lot of attention in the OHL as a towering forward who can score. Some might be hesitant to draft a tall guy without outstanding numbers, thinking, ""Oh, there go those scouts again, falling in love with size."" Ratcliffe isn't a tree though. He has pretty decent offensive skills for a big man. He can make plenty of scoring chances happen with his puck-protection skills and winning battles around the net, but he can make a creative play with the puck as well. He also has a bullet of a wrist shot. Ratcliffe's skating isn't a selling point, but he's not lumbering around the ice. I don't love his projection, but I wouldn't fault an NHL team at all for taking him.",,,,,,,"Ratcliffe is massive winger whose game is
developing at a very impressive rate. He is offensiveminded and likes to have the puck on his stick. The
first thing you notice about Ratcliffe is his massive stature
- he's a giant on the ice and he definitely uses his size to set
a physical tone. He has a mean streak, and loves to throw his
weight around.
He will lower the boom on anyone in his way, flattening his
opponents along the boards in hopes of causing a turnover.
That being said, he isn't a goon constantly looking to drop
the gloves; although when he does he handles himself really
well. For a big guy Ratcliffe is quite an impressive skater, and
his ability to move the puck really stands out. He can pick
them up and put them down generating impressive speed
as he blasts down the wing.
He is more the finisher than playmaker, although he does
possess solid vision and hands. He has a surprisingly quick
release on his shot and gets lots of power behind it as he
leverages his height, and can get off a strong shot without
setting his feet first. His shot accuracy is impressive and
many of his tallies this season were of the skilled variety.
Ratcliffe has the makeup of an NHL player, his big body,
impressive strength and skill combo are unmatched by any
OHL forward. He is a tower of a human being, and uses his
body size to set screens on the power play; he is extremely
effective at this because his size makes him very difficult
to move for any player on the ice. He definitely isn't afraid
of the rough areas of the ice and spends most of his time
playing there. He puts in a good effort on the defensive end
as well, backchecking with purpose and doing a good job
angling his opponents towards the boards
Ratcliffe is a tall and gangly, powerful winger for the OHL
level. He will need to add a good twenty-five pounds to his
frame to get the most out of it. His mobility and balance will
need to improve with added leg strength. He gets knocked
over too easily for a guy his size, mostly due to the fact that
he is still learning to manage his height and growing into his
frame.
 He also has some trouble cornering and turning with
smaller forwards as it takes a bit of time to turn this big
battleship. Defensively, his game is simple as he has plenty of development in that regard. Ratcliffe's inconsistency
continues to be his biggest knock however. About a third of
his shifts throughout the season he completely disappeared
or became a completely different player. On these shifts
he avoided contact, displayed poor positioning and puck
watches. We feel a little maturity is needed but believe it will
come in time."
2017,RW,71.25,164.93,36,NJD,,Jesper Boqvist,"I struggled to get a good read on Boqvist this season. On the one hand, his numbers versus men in the SHL-2 this season and in the Swedish under-20 league last season are outstanding. On the other hand, while I've come away with positive impressions from viewings, he doesn't do anything to set off a flashing sign that says ""surefire NHL scorer."" Boqvist possesses very good speed and puck skills. You occasionally see him have a ""wow"" moment where he makes a very creative play with the puck, or evade pressure in a difficult manner. He can be taken out of the game physically, though. I have never been a huge fan of his defensive play, but the way he's transitioned to the pro game gives me some optimism that he could be a competent forward in his own end.",,,,,,,"Boqvist is a speedster with
lethal offensive skills. He
is a very fluid, agile skater
who shows impressive lateral
movement. He possesses a
smooth-skating style and often
makes use of his speed to beat
defensemen on the outside. His
speed, combined with very fine
hands, is what makes him such
a dangerous player. He reads
the play and defensive coverage
very well, with the ability to
pick apart and find open areas.
His quick feet and hands makes
him dangerous. He is strong on
the puck for a player his size,
and is difficult to catch due to
a shifty, elusive style. He uses
both speed and hands to create
scoring chances. He can carry
the puck into the offensive zone
and hold on to it in order to let
his teammates get into position,
before hitting them in stride
with a soft easy to handle pass.
He possesses an accurate shot
and displays a natural goalscoring touch, but his shot could
be a bit more powerful. He
lives for offense but sometimes
forgets to work hard in his own
zone as well. His intensity can go
from high to non-existent in a
hurry so finding his consistency
in that aspect will need to
be addressed going forward.
He has the potential to be an
exciting offensive forward at the
next level but will need to add
strength and consistency for
that to transpire."
2017,RW,72,190,37,BUF,,Marcus Davidsson,"Davidsson got a regular shift in the SHL this season, though he didn't play on a very strong Djurgarden team. He has shown fine playing over the years in international play as a guy who pushes the play forward. Scouts I talk to overseas have one common description of Davidsson: smart. He's a versatile player. He can play center or the wing effectively and play a role on both special teams. Davidsson skates at an above-average level, sometimes flashing a very high grade. He can make some offensive plays, but I wouldn't describe him as a dangler -- more as a quick decision-maker with decent vision. He'll work hard to win pucks and projects to have value defensively as a pro.",,,,,,,"Davidsson is a skilled twoway center. His skating
ability stands out, both
with decent top-end speed, and
great edgework and strength
in his lower half. He has quick
feet and a quick changing of
direction. His puck handling
is solid but not highlight-reel
worthy. He also shows good
hand-eye coordination with
an impressive ability to tip
pucks from the slot area. Makes
a positive impact in his own
end, covering his man well
and getting his nose dirty in
battles for the puck. He does
not hesitate when he has
opportunities to shoot the puck.
His release is quick and his shot
boasts good power. He shows
exceptional ability at protecting
the puck from opposing
defenders with his reach and
hands. He shows the attitude
and willingness to go to net and
pay the price for driving through
greasy areas. He is good in
penalty kill situations, pressing
his man high. He shows good
defensive skills and reads the
game smartly all over the ice.
Davidsson isn't a very physical
player, however he does use
his frame to his advantage in
puck battles, where possible.
His vision and ability to make
the right play stands out as he
possess all the tools needed to
be a solid two-way center. It's all
about bringing it consistently to

He sees passing lanes and
open ice very well when going
back to retrieve the puck and
displays a strong ability to play
a long accurate outlet pass,
transitioning from defense to
offense in a split second. He
is agile for his size and shows
decent top speed. His skating is
improving but still good enough
to not hinder his play at this
level. He uses an assortment of
a shot arsenal, a hard slap shot

where he possesses the puck

2017,RW,74,195.6,39,DAL,,Jason Robertson,"Robertson had a big draft season that generated a fair amount of discussion in scouting circles. He put up big scoring numbers, including great shot numbers, generating shots at the pace of the best prospects in this class such as Nico Hischier and Owen Tippett. He is a tall, strong forward who works hard to win pucks, and his ability to win battles is a plus attribute. He has above-average puck skills and can make plays in open ice. Robertson is often tagged as a goal scorer, with a very good shot that helped him be one of the top scorers in the OHL this season. However, he is also a smart player who gets his chances through good reads and getting to the right spots on the ice. I've also seen him make nice passes and smart reads that help his team maintain possession. The big problem with Robertson is that he has anvils for feet, and it's his skating that causes a lot of debate on his long-term value.",,,,,,,"Robertson is a big, strong, and opportunistic goalscoring winger. His skating stride is balanced and
allows him good lateral agility, although his top speed
is just average. Robertson has excellent passing ability,
and is patient and poised while the puck is on his stick. He
possesses a great shot, with strong velocity that he likes to
use early and often.
His puckhandling is above-average, especially for a powerforward, showing quick decision-making and using his
body effectively. Once he's in the offensive zone he's hard to
contain, thanks to his large frame and strong stance, making
him tough to push off the puck or out of position. He is
highly effective in front of the net, setting screens for shots
and jamming in loose pucks around the crease. He uses his
large frame to battle along the boards and this hard work
often produces a couple of really good chances on net per
game.
Robertson can dictate play with his size and net drive, and
he does a good job controlling the puck on the outside
with a long reach and above-average puck skills. His biggest
strength is that he's a shot generator. Robertson does an
excellent job finding holes in the offensive zone to receive
passes and get off a quick release. He isn't just a one trick
pony - he's a relentless forechecker who suffocates his man
until he forces a turnover.
He has some solid power-forward potential at the NHL level
and is someone we would not be surprised to see go a lot
higher than where we have him ranked, based on projected
upside.
Robertson's offensive play can often be overshadowed by
his poor defensive zone play. He is often slow to get back
and when he does he seems almost lost positionally. He often floats near the top of the circles waiting for the breakout
pass and rarely engages in retrieving the puck in this zone.
It is strange to see the amount of effort he puts in keeping
and regaining possession of the puck in the offensive zone
and then the complete lack of interest in getting involved in
battles in the defensive zone.
He will never be a speed burner as his skating has some
deficiencies and he struggles to gain separation from his
opponents. Robertson is a high-end talent but he needs
to continue to improve defensively, improve his speed and
learn to consistently dictate at the OHL level. "
2017,C,72,149.2,40,FLA,,Aleksi Heponiemi,"I was impressed by Heponiemi all season, from his dominant performance at the Ivan Hlinka tournament in the summer through his season in the WHL. Heponiemi is a dynamic playmaker. He can use his great skating ability to push the pace and create chances off the rush. He also has the top-level vision to see plays develop from a slower pace and make the difficult feeds. Heponiemi has above-average stick skills, and though he isn't a very dangerous shooter, overall he's a dangerous offensive weapon. Detractors will point to his 5-foot-10 frame, and that he isn't very physical. I think he's OK defensively, and given his high hockey IQ, I think he'll find a way to survive.",,,,,,,"Heponiemi has a dynamic
offensive skillset and
smarts packed into a
tiny frame. He's a slick skater
who is strong on his edges,
makes quick dashes to get
into openings and is deceptive
with changes of pace through
the neutral zone and into
scoring areas. He breathes
high-end hockey sense and is
a creative passer that drives
the play. He feathers the puck
onto the tape of teammates
and holds the play until the
last possible second before
making an accurate play to
create a prime scoring chance.
His shot release is quick but
there is lacklustre strength to
his shot. He plays an intense
game and works hard to carry
the offensive load. Creativity
with his speed sets him apart
as he is able to get to open ice
quickly and remain slippery
with possession. He is able to
find that open spot and get off a
good shot with his quick release.
His size doesn't allow him to
compete in physical battles. His
defensive game leaves a little
to be desired. He is a stick-first
defensive player who relies a lot
on his agility to keep with plays
and poke at the puck. We see
him transitioning to the wing at
the NHL level due to his lack of
size and strength, but he does
have top-six potential thanks to
the intelligence that makes his
skill level so effective"
2016,C,74.25,216,1,TML,,Auston Matthews,"Teams dream about getting a legit No. 1 center like Matthews when picking at the top of the draft. A 6-foot-2, 210-pound pivot with a skill level that is off the charts, he's also got professional experience to boot, and he's been making Swiss cheese out of his opponents in the NLA. Matthews is a magician with the puck; not one of those pretend magicians you'll find in Las Vegas, but like the ones you read about in fiction novels. He is so coordinated and creative that it's nearly impossible to strip him of the puck. Combining that with an incredible touch that can have him effortlessly saucer pass across the rink onto the blade, or place it on a shot wherever he wants to, and he's a nightmare for teams to defend. He's a very good skater, and while he's not among the very top tier of the class in terms of speed, he can explode down the ice with anyone.

Matthews isn't perfect. His real weakness is when the offense isn't flowing through him. He's not a really physical player who will grind for pucks along the wall, nor is he some sort of defensive stalwart. Matthews still uses his big frame to win pucks and competes well on the ice in every zone, but the team drafting him must be realistic about what he's going to be in terms of the gritty areas of the game.",,,,,,,"A complete package at center, Matthews excels in all areas of the ice and makes his
teammates better. He's the kind of player who, in the same shift, can generate a creative scoring opportunity with exceptional vision and passing plays before quickly transitioning to shut down the opposition's chance on the backcheck. A strong, smooth, mobile skater with quick feet and superb agility,
Matthews can increase his speed to impressive levels as he moves up ice with the puck on his stick.
His speed is deceptive at times because defenders get caught up in thinking that this hulking center
can't move as fast as he can. He has agility to dance around his man and to protect the puck with
his size, strength and explosiveness in all directions. His skill on the power play is shown time
and time again, but it is his play down a man that makes him so solid overall; not only is this kid
a gifted offensive player, he is a reliable force defensively. Matthews uses his mobility to quickly
get to the right areas of the defensive zone to cut the time and space of the puck carrier. He
does exactly what a center should be doing—being one of the frst ones back and helping
clear the zone before joining the rush. He works his tail off all over the ice and will go down
low to scoop up the puck in one clean movement before turning to break out of the zone. He
is consistently defensively responsible; someone his coach can count on. A magician with
the puck at times, Matthews shows his creative stickhandling and ability to fool defenders with impressive dekes. He looks like a man among boys as he dangles the puck on
a string in tight and right around opposing players. He dishes crisp passes—exploiting
open lanes—and can get creative in putting the puck through the smallest of lanes to
hit his man with a timely pass. He displays true patience and picks his spots, but not
forcing things. Matthews possesses a crackling wrist shot that releases with incredible
power. He's involved in all facets of the game and will be an impact player in the NHL. There's not a lot to pick on, but one knock on Matthews is that at
times, he can try to do too much himself and get drawn out of position; a by-product of playing with teammates who cannot match his instincts. He can also get
too fancy at times, like many creative playmakers can, opting to go for the pass
instead of the obvious safe play that is right in front of him. Also, he is not as
fashy offensively as some team's fanbases might want with a No.1 overall selection, however, that does not impact his effectiveness."
2016,RW,75.75,201,2,WPG,,Patrik Laine,"Laine is everything you want in a high-skill power forward. First, he's built like a truck at 6-foot-4, 206 pounds, with broad shoulders and great core strength. It's a joy to watch film of Laine shrugging off checks left and right, and easily winning loose puck battles. He's equally adept at being a playmaker as he is being a goal scorer. Laine's offensive IQ is high-end, bordering on elite. He's a very creative puck handler who anticipates pressure well, and knows how to create space for himself. He moves the puck quickly with few errors.

Off the puck, he finds the open seams well, and can launch a scoring chance from almost anywhere on the ice, having probably the best shot in this class. Laine's skating is his one notable flaw, although he's gotten a little quicker from last season. He's average in that area, and I don't think he's going to jet past NHL defensemen. Overall, he's a special forward, someone who could be an elite scoring power winger in the NHL for the next decade.",,,,,,,"A man-child, Laine has been a focal offensive player with Liiga champion Tappara with
an elite goal-scorer's skill set complemented by his size and developing 200-foot game. He loves to
be the guy who is leading the charge on the play and does so in an imposing manner. Even with the
height and weight of his frame, he has some quick feet. Laine only needs a few powerful steps to
accelerate before he can lengthen out his stride and get to max speed, an area that he has dramatically improved over the past two seasons. He has tremendous balance on his feet, maintaining
technique through transition and becoming a human battering ram due to the momentum he is capable of building. Laine loves to carry the puck with speed, and has the ability to recognize lanes
or holes he can travel through that provide the least amount of defensive resistance. When challenged for space, he has the ability to hide the puck and use his power to maintain control. Has
some superb puck skills and can dazzle with jaw-dropping hands. He consistently shows a high
level of creativity without grave risk-taking tendencies. Offensively, he is more of a sniper than
a set-up guy, although he doesn't lack in either skill category. His elite IQ makes the world his
oyster when setting up shop offensively. Laine has the magic touch with his passes, calming
pucks quickly before moving them accurately. He is capable of making a lot of plays based
on sensing where his teammates are going to be and leading them perfectly to pick up a
puck in stride. When he keeps the puck, he loves to get off his lethal shot. His release is
all-pro and helps him maintain a consistent spray chart on net. He has also shown his
one-timer is a goaltender's nightmare, with his combination of timing and power. Laine's
confdence level is through the roof with and without the puck, knowing where he needs
to be for optimal success. He always seems to be moving to fnd open ice where he
can support a play. He plays the game with a high tempo and loves to get involved
in pressure scenarios. Laine activates his feet on the forecheck to get a bead on the
puck carrier and wallop him with a solid check. He has great ability to recognize the
play developing through the neutral zone and in his own end. His reach is spectacular and so is his ability to get his stick in the comfort zone of his opponents. While his defensive ability has been growing by leaps and
bounds, there are still some areas that will need some fne-tuning. He can
also get a little too “Harlem Globetrotter” with the puck at times, which leads
to turnovers. An NHL coach will want to rein in that creativity a little during
fve-on-fve play, while still encouraging him to bring it out during shootouts."
2016,C,74.25,205,3,CBJ,,Pierre-Luc Dubois,"Dubois was one of the best players in the QMJHL this season and nearly made Canada's WJC team. I've never watched Dubois play and come away thinking he's the best skater or the best puck handler in a given match, but he always makes a positive contribution. He's incredibly well-rounded, though. Dubois can play both the wing and center effectively, but is more comfortable on the wing. He's a skilled scorer with very good two-way hockey IQ who can flash high-end vision.

He's a very physically developed player, who is strong, competitive on the ice, drives to the dirty areas, and is committed to his fitness off the ice. Whenever Dubois gets into a 1-on-1 battle, he tends to come out with the puck. He's not the fastest skater but he doesn't slug around the ice, either. He projects as an NHL forward who can be slotted into a variety of roles, and has a low-risk factor on his projection.",,,,,,,"Dubois is a rangy forward who seems to always be on the attack. He has a fortuitous blend of size, strength and hockey sense. He is quite mobile for a player of his size. His hockey
sense and passes are strong; he anticipates plays well and gets the puck into dangerous areas in
the offensive zone. Dubois has very strong vision that he uses to hit streaking teammates on the
rush. He skates well, making quick, deliberate cuts to create separation and, at times, hits a second
gear when he needs to create some space or get on an opponent on the backcheck. His strength
and balance on his skates are defnitely more evident than any breakaway speed or acceleration.
Dubois keeps his head up and pivots his body positioning to make plays and protect the puck.
He is able to use his size to his favor when engaging in battles along the boards. As he skates
toward the boards, he engages and overpowers his opponent, gaining body position over the
puck. He is able to do this against every opponent no matter if they are big or small. He has no
hesitation when engaging in scrums after the whistle, but remains cool-headed. His hockey
sense is on display as he is able to see plays develop before they come to fruition. Dubois
has impressive vision and quick decision-making to determine the best route to take to break
into the offensive zone before having the puck on his stick. As he powers into the zone and
through defenders, Dubois really demonstrates his size and strength on his skates. His
shot is heavy and quick off his blade. His hockey sense extends to both the offensive and
defensive zones. Dubois engages with his man in front of his net, tying up his stick. He
will block a shot or come down low and make a check to separate the attacker from the
puck. He does a great job on the forecheck, putting a lot of pressure on the defense.
Dubois is a smart hockey player who plays with some solid skill and strength. There's not a lot to pick from here. If you want to pick his skating apart, you would note Dubois' wide stance that fghts his ability to generate
quickness off the hop. He is strong on his feet and nearly impossible to knock off
the puck. He is also very agile, cutting laterally quickly and using strong edges.
If Dubois could improve his frst few steps, that would help his game immensely.
He will want to continue to add more muscle to his already impressive frame
as well. Lastly, he does not possess the fashy, creative, offensive mind teams
like to add with a top-fve pick. NHL fans will need to understand what he
brings—a strong power/physical/fnesse blend—and value him for that instead of looking for him to lead their team's offense."
2016,RW,76,203,4,EDM,,Jesse Piljujarvi,"Puljujarvi is one of the most exciting prospects Finland has produced. He's a big, explosive winger, who was the second-highest scoring 17-year-old ever at the WJC, tied with Eric Lindros and a point behind Jaromir Jagr. He's an unbelievable skater for a 6-foot-4 player, having a great top gear and a really fluid stride. He's not that physically aggressive, but he closes on guys so well that he pressures and wins battles effectively. Puljujarvi shows a high-skill level, a plus shot and high-end hockey IQ. He is constantly around the puck and setting up his teammates.

He's not quite defensively sound yet, but he shows effort in that area, and with proper development, we could see that area of his game grow. To get an idea of what a competitor he is, a few hours before the gold medal game at the IIHF under-18 world championship, Puljujarvi was sick in bed. He then went out and carried his team to a championship, scoring a hat trick. (thanks to Twitter user Tuomo Vartianen for pointing this out). At his ultimate upside, he could be one of the more dynamic scorers in the NHL.",,,,,,,"Puljujarvi is an offensive fxture who skates like the wind and provides size. He has an
explosive frst step for a big body and has no noticeable faws in his stride. There is great extension on
his skating stride when he is moving fat out, allowing him to control the speed of the game. His acceleration is spectacular for someone his size, allowing him to get the quick jump once he recognizes
a spot to where he needs to get. Despite being noted as a scorer, we think he is just as profcient
as a set-up guy. Puljujarvi keeps his feet moving and remains patient until he is content with the
development of the play before passing the puck. His vision is near the top of this class and he is
able to lay out situational passes of each unique scenario. He works well with limited space and
has the puck skills to maintain possession in open ice while in motion or working under duress.
Puljujarvi oozes high-end skill and awareness, showing an ability to remain elusive. He loves
to drive to the net from the perimeter with or without the puck, showing readiness to make a
split-second move to create an opportunity. He does a good job of drawing defenders to him
and opening up opportunities for teammates. He boasts a powerful shot and a goal-scoring
instinct to fnd lanes that allow him to be a threat from anywhere. He is constantly moving
his feet and never remains fat-footed, always looking for an open area of the ice where he
can pick up the play. While he pitches in and plays on the boards, Puljujarvi has a noticeable style of circling a scrum and preparing himself to pick up a puck and carry the play
to open ice. He is hard to play against and a real threat to overthrow possession on the
forecheck. Defensively, Puljujarvi shows hustle and tenacity. He recognizes threats and
backchecks all the way to his goal. He plays with the range of a center and reads the
play to go where he can offer support. His wingspan is a huge asset as it allows him
to get to the puck and limit the range of his opponents. Puljujarvi follows puck movement well and has quick reactions that enable him to steal pucks and transition the
play up ice. Puljujarvi can manhandle opponents in a lot of matchups, but
his physical checking game does need refnement. He needs to square up the
body a bit better to avoid taking himself out of the play when delivering a check.
While he can dominate, he also has his moments where he melts into the background. While we believe he will put up his share of points, the big difference
between him and Laine is the projected NHL offensive upside. It's not really
a weakness of Puljujarvi's, but more a reason why he is slotted at number
three for FC"
2016,D,74,182,5,VAN,,Olli Juolevi,"One of the best defensemen in the OHL this season, Juolevi also recorded the highest point totals ever by an under-18 defenseman at the WJC. Juolevi is a fantastic skater. He exerts very little effort to get up to a dangerous top gear and moves well in all directions. His puck movement is high-end, as he shows calmness, skill and elite hockey sense when he has the puck on his stick. He's able to QB a power play with the best of them, on top of creating dangerous chances in transition. He's also not afraid to take risks, but he's very calculating when he does, and rarely does he hurt his team.

Juolevi's smarts translate to defense. He is always getting his stick on pucks and is an overall reliable defensive player in his positional play. He could stand to bulk up quite a bit, as he has a bit of a beanpole frame (6-foot-2, 182 pounds). However, Juolevi still works hard on the ice to win battles and get to pucks even if his frame isn't ideal for those situations yet.",,,,,,," Juolevi is a fuid, two-way defenseman who plays a strong puck-moving game. He
processes the game at a very high level and appears very calm when pressured, not rushing just any
old play with the puck, but instead evaluating what would be the best play. He quickly escapes trouble
with his quick feet and good puck protection before moving the puck to the safe option. His choices
of pass options are very strong and put him a good position to help his team succeed. He is a strong
backward skater who can vary his speed based on the play in front of him thanks to his ability to
anticipate and react quickly. Juolevi keeps strong gaps and an active stick to knock pucks off his
opponents' sticks. A very mature thinker, he just always seems to be aware of what is going on
around him and seems able to predict what is going to happen next. Juolevi reacts well to add
support on the wall in an effort to get the puck free; once he gets it on his tape, he does a good
job of pushing the play forward by either skating it or with a crisp pass to his target in open ice.
When he sees the opportunity, he will come off the blueline and skate into the puck to unload a
slap shot as well, and while his shot is not overly powerful, he gets it right on target and places it where he wants it. He consistently dishes crisp passes to his best options, seeing the
ice very well in front of him and to the side, executing strong D-to-D passes and being there
as a support option for his partner when he does not have the puck. Juolevi carries the
puck on the attack with poise and speed, showing no signs of hesitation or losing control
of the puck, even at his top speed. He displays incredible awareness as he works his way
up ice, reading the play and seeing lanes develop very well. He shows off some quick
hands and feet as he moves the puck at the point, holding onto it until a lane presents
itself to slip a pass through. Juolevi has good offensive instincts to read the play and
drop down from the point to support his teammates in possession. Juolevi can be prone to chasing the puck carrier and extending
his stick instead of playing the body. This leaves him open to being manipulated by
faster or more skilled puckhandlers and looking silly when he gets beat by a dangle or two. Defensively, he makes head-scratching decisions. Juolevi also needs
to avoid coming to a stop when defending as this limits his effectiveness and
gives the man the space needed to make a play. There's not much in the way
of physical play to this guy as he does not play with much grit or sandpaper.
His shot is accurate and effective in getting to the net for his skilled teammates in London to manufacture a second chance, but it has low velocity
and will need to improve to remain effective at the next level."
2016,LW,74,200,6,CGY,,Matthew Tkachuk,"Keith Tkachuk's son has been a standout for years at multiple levels. He was great last season in the USHL and with the USNTDP, was a top player at the world under-18 championship, and a top player this season in the OHL. He is a multi-dimensional scoring winger. You talk to any scout about Tkachuk, they come back raving about his hockey IQ. He has great vision and offensive creativity, and makes quick, precise decisions with the puck. He can dangle defensemen, and create offense out of nothing, but Tkachuk is also a relentless worker. He wins more than his fair share of battles, and is his father's son on some days, being a pain in the rear for many defenders and goalies.

His speed isn't at the same level as his hands and vision. He's not slow, but he's certainly not a top-end speedster, either. Tkachuk can also get caught cheating a little defensively, an area of his game that he'll need to tighten up.",,,,,,,"Tkachuk, son of former NHL power forward Keith Tkachuk, is a feisty pro-style winger
who goes hard to the net. He is an offense-minded winger who plays a quick-thinking, dynamic game.
He is a clever winger with explosive burst who has the ability to take over a game with his play down
low. Tkachuk has a tendency to go to the front of the net and around the crease, both with and without
the puck, as he intelligently anticipates the puck's movement. He has a penchant for getting to prime
offensive areas thanks to his high hockey IQ and ability to squeeze through bodies to gain positioning. Tkachuk has a fair to his game, making creative and skilled passes, and has no trouble making slick moves with the puck while under pressure. Even when he is completely stretched out, he
is strong on the puck, protecting it and making it diffcult for defenders to knock him off it. He puts
himself in the right position on his check to hold them off and when knocked down, he is quick
to get back up and is more driven than before to make something happen and make the opponent pay. The winger displays a long, extremely strong northbound stride, which allows him to
pick up speed with each push through the ice. Tkachuk uses his speed effectively to chase
down and pressure the puck-carrier and/or get moving up. The biggest strength in his game
is his vision in all areas of the ice. He can make a timely behind-the-back pass right on the
tape of his teammate streaking for the net while holding off a defender's check. He sees
the whole ice and makes quick decisions on the best option after quickly evaluating and
seeing the play develop. Tkachuk exploits lanes and picks his spots with near perfection.
While at high speed, he still maintains possession of the puck and can do so while he
makes elusive plays and power moves around defenders without slowing down. He
possesses creative and fast hands as he moves to the net with a goal-scorer's touch.
Defensively, he races back on the backcheck and picks up his man, even covering
up missed assignments when needed. Tkachuk is a little bit choppy off the hop in his skating stride to
get up to top speed, but he shows strong agility and small-space quickness. He
can also cross the line physically and lose his cool from time to time—a common
trait in fery competitors that they must learn to harness and control. An NHL
coach will love his fre, but Tkachuk needs to control it and still get under his
opposition's skin while not taking retaliatory penalties or getting carried away
after the whistle. He is also a prospect who, while very dangerous down low
on offense, he has his limitations creating off the rush."
2016,C,70,163.98,7,ARI,,Clayton Keller,"One of the best players ever to participate at the USA Hockey National Team Development Program (USNTDP), Keller put up monstrous numbers between his USHL, collegiate and international performances. He's a complete offensive player who seems to generate chances and display distinct puck-moving abilities whenever he takes a shift. Keller has an explosive first step and an above-average top gear. He's not an incredible skater for a smaller guy, but he still skates very well. Keller handles the puck at a top level, too, but his clear best trait is his hockey sense. He just makes so many good, high-level decisions with and without the puck that allow his team to maintain possession and get shooting lanes. Keller never seems rattled with the puck, and makes the right plays seem easy.

While not a defensive stalwart, Keller has shown decent defensive prowess this season. His size and physical game limitations are obvious issues, but there is a lot to like in his game other than that.",,,,,,,"Keller is an absolute offensive stud in the making. He has the ability to create space
and time with his exceptional skating ability, quick turns, speed, acceleration and elusiveness. He's
incredible at handling the puck in traffc. He tries things with the puck that other players don't even
dream of doing. Keller sees the play develop exceptionally well, and isn't afraid to make the creative
play in hopes of getting on the score sheet. His skating ability is nearly fawless. He's so quick with
his stops and starts, and has breakaway speed. Keller is truly a nightmare to defend, especially for
those bigger, lumbering defenders. The aspects of his game that are at elite levels are his vision
and playmaking ability. His creativeness is just outstanding as he looks like he is in a class of his
own every time the puck is on his stick. He combines his deceptive fakes and stick work to make
highlight-reel plays at any given moment. A real calm customer, Keller isn't fazed by bigger/
stronger defenders, and when in tight, he uses his dynamic combination of skills to fnd ways
to get to the net. When not using his vision and playmaking ability to set up others in prime
real estate, he isn't afraid to rip the puck on net with a quick release and deadly accurate
shot. He is consistently buzzing around the net to fnd loose pucks and works really hard to
transition the play from his own zone. Keller isn't the most physical player, but he still gets
his quick stick to the right spots to create turnovers, to retrieve the puck or to defect shots
on defense. It's the same story year after year: A prospect has game-breaking
skills and is a real offensive dynamo, but lacks the ideal size to succeed at the NHL
level. Or, so many think. This view is why so many of today's top offensive forwards
are drafted later than their skills should dictate. Yet, oftentimes, the guys who are
smaller end up catching up somewhat when they hit the weights and it has no ill
effect on their abilities at the NHL level. Will Keller be one of those who makes us
look back and wonder why he wasn't a top-fve pick? Other than size, his game is
not the most balanced as he is all offense, and has plenty of room to improve his
defensive abilities and awareness. "
2016,LW,72.5,178,8,BUF,,Alexander Nylander,"Brother of Leafs prospect William Nylander and son of former NHLer Michael Nylander, Alexander was one of the top scorers in the OHL this season, and was one of the top under-18 scorers ever at the WJC. His skill level and his offensive hockey sense are elite. Nylander is able to think the game so quickly, and dominate possession whenever he gets near the puck. He sees options developing even without directly looking down the lanes, and is able to create space for himself. He's got guts with the puck, sometimes putting the puck in risky spots, but overall he makes plays few other forwards do.

Nylander's speed is not elite, but it's certainly above-average and flashes a grade above on top of his being very agile on his edges. He also features a quality wrist shot as well. Nylander's defense could still use work. He's too prone to losing battles and can misplay his position, but he did show significant progression in that area as the season went on, and steadily earned penalty killing time in the second half. He shows strong work ethic, and you can envision him cleaning up that area with proper development.",,,,,,,"Nylander is a smart, super-skilled winger who will make you pay if you give him the
tiniest of space. This Swede—the son of former NHLer Michael Nylander—doesn't let up in possession
and is a driven forward who wants to create offense in whatever way possible. He fnds his spots in the
offensive zone and picks apart lanes exceptionally well. Nylander does a good job of using his shoulder to push off from his check and protect the puck, shifting his weight enough to maintain balance
and drive to the outside. He possesses quick feet and some high-end agility, allowing him to explode
off the hop and in all directions. His puck skills complement his incredible shot perfectly; he plays
with the puck on a string thanks to quick hands and confdence to do something great. Nylander
possesses incredible puck skills in tight quarters and can easily stickhandle in a phone booth.
He is quick to escape trouble by combining his puck skills, skating and hockey sense—he uses
his quick agility to dash through with the puck in close as he scopes out the play around him
to escape to open ice and make a play with the puck. His shot is his greatest asset—it is fast
and rocket-like—and he has a deceptive release from in close while in movement. Nylander
has the ability to speed up and slow down the play with possession, something that not many
players can do effectively. He's an absolute threat with the puck on his stick as he can push
the play, undress defenders, and make a pass you wouldn't expect or take a deceptively
hard shot that makes goalies freeze in their tracks. Nylander has very good timing about
when to pressure the puck-carrier and use his stick and slippery play to strip the puck;
it's almost unexpected when he swoops in and removes the puck from the man, making
him a threat away from the puck. His offensive upside, thanks to his quick, deceptive
release, exceptional vision and hockey IQ, is extremely high. Nylander has a tendency to ease off at times, which limits his
effectiveness. He isn't always fully engaged defensively, something he will need to
work on to become an all-around threat. He does not play his man hard enough,
allowing his check to be free and clear to get the puck and get a quality scoring
chance. He can easily fx his defensive play with his high hockey IQ and innate
ability to read the game and adapt. Nylander has a bit of a tendency to stand
still when in possession offensively, making him vulnerable to being knocked
off balance when he least expects it."
2016,D,74.25,221.36,9,MON,,Mikhail Sergachev,"Sergachyov had a very strong rookie season in the OHL, displaying two-way abilities and putting up big counting numbers from the blue line. He was the youngest player ever to win the OHL Defenseman of the Year award. Sergachyov is a fantastic skater for a big man, showing a technically sound stride and an above-average first step. He moves the puck well, is a creative power-play quarterback showing good patience and vision, and has a rocket for a shot. Sergachyov wins battles, shuts down lanes due to his speed, frame and toughness, and has an edge to his game as well. His defensive positioning can use some tweaking, but he shows a decent amount of awareness in that area, even if I wouldn't qualify his hockey IQ as high-end. He's a player with a lot of upside.",,,,,,,"Sergachev is a smooth-skating defenseman who isn't afraid to use his body. He looks
very comfortable and confdent, quietly playing a strong and effective game from the back end. He
plays in all situations and is successful; he effectively cuts off his man's routes, and gets the puck out
of pressure situations. Sergachev reads the situations well and does not just get rid of the puck in a
hurry. With some space and time, he is patient looking for other options besides just banging it off the
wall or down the ice. A key member of the Spitfres power play unit, he moves the puck around the
top of the zone with confdence and poise, and utilizes his vision and creativity when he sees an
opportunity to slide down low for a shot. Sergachev has a very heavy point shot that is positioned
well. A high-end skater who has exceptional acceleration, he can explode laterally in one step,
which makes all the difference. He shows excellent edge work to maintain balance and strength,
cutting up the ice with shifty feet and quick pivots. Sergachev stays calm and collected skating
with the puck, while also generating tremendous speed as he crosses over and moves his way
up ice. He is a powerful skater when he gets moving and is almost unstoppable on his feet.
He displays impressive awareness and knows when an opponent is lining him up, adapting
accordingly to move laterally and protect the puck while using his speed to separate from
the man, not getting fustered or making an unnecessary play with the puck. He sees lanes
develop and hits his man with a crisp pass. He is a high-end puck mover. His passes are
crisp and he leads his man. Calm and composed with the puck, Sergachev makes smart
plays to get the puck up ice. He is cool as a cucumber, showing absolutely no hesitation
under pressure. He remains composed and relaxed with pressure or when there are no
options available, never appearing fustered even in the worst of times. Defensively,
he marks his man and makes a strong effort to keep him contained to the outside and
away from the slot and high-threat areas. While he does play a well-rounded, two-way game, Sergachev's
offensive upside might not reach as high as some other defensemen available in
this draft. While he has made incredible strides this past season, his game and
understanding of how to play the defensive position is still developing as he just
picked up the game eight years ago as a 9-year-old in his native Russia. He
will need to get stronger to continue to effectively play his physical style at the
next level."
2016,C,71,189.5,10,COL,,Tyson Jost,"Jost was simply fantastic this season, putting up huge numbers for a 17-year-old in the BCHL, even when you adjust for its lesser league quality. He is a dynamic, athletic center with decent off-the-puck skills as well. Jost is one of the better skaters in his draft class, with an easy, explosive stride whose first few steps will be able to evade NHL checkers. He's a highly-skilled puck handler who can execute high-difficulty plays in tight spaces, as well as make above-average passes.

Jost's defensive play has shown significant improvement during this season. I didn't love his defensive positioning last year, but by the world under-18 championship in the spring, he was arguably Canada's best defensive forward. Bigger players can muscle him off pucks too easily at times. However, Jost does work his tail off, often being one of the hardest working players on the ice on top of being one of the most skilled. He has committed to the University of North Dakota for next season.",,,,,,,"Jost is a strong, dynamic center with solid two-way ability. An extremely smart offensive weapon, he will make the simple play when it is best to do so, but he isn't afraid to fash his
creativity from time to time. He loves to make the give-and-go play, working with the space provided
and moving the puck quickly. He is relentless on the forecheck, using his stick to strip the puck from
the man, and is strong at protecting the puck with his free arm and back on the perimeter. Jost has
a laser-beam for a wrist shot and he can score from a distance off the rush. His greatest attributes
are his instincts and sense. Jost has an uncanny understanding of the timing required to execute,
and his ability to fnd open soft spots from which to present himself as a passing option is rare.
Equally impressive is the well-roundedness of his offensive arsenal, both as a playmaker and a
goal-scorer. He has a bit of a sneaky streak, and loves to use his speed to beat defenders to get
in good scoring spots. Jost loves to drive the puck to the net, and isn't afraid to go to the dirty
areas. He works hard, and is a natural-born leader out on the ice, always talking and giving
advice and pointers to teammates. Jost looks very comfortable in all situations, and could
be a guy who will play big minutes at the next level. He plays with some feistiness and is
willing to get his nose dirty each and every shift. He is effective in all three zones, and uses
his high hockey IQ to make sure he is in prime position to make a play. Defensively, Jost
consistently drives down low into his own zone, picks up his man and plays him tight. He
has a great stick-lifting ability while chasing down opponents and creating turnovers; just
being a real pain for opposing players. He has an impeccable ability to win key faceoffs,
and is put out in key situations regardless of the zone. He continues to make smart
decisions over and over again, while making the right moves that put his team in the
best position possible. While Jost is physically wiry strong, he is not overly large or durable, and the way he plays—such as going hard after the puck along the wall even
when a big check is imminent—he opens himself up to potential injury. He is also
not seen as someone who will be a top point-producer, carrying the offense of his
NHL team. While he is projected to be capable of playing on a top offensive line,
he is not the most creative player; instead, he's a guy who will complement a
top offensive player with his two-way play. "
2016,C,78.25,220,11,OTT,,Logan Brown,"A native of Raleigh, North Carolina, Brown has been a much-discussed prospect in the scouting ranks for years, and for a variety of reasons. He is often defined as having ""all the tools."" He's a 6-foot-6 center, with high-end skill who can dominate a game whenever he gets near the puck. He's a very smart playmaker with great patience, vision and instincts. Though not a blazer, he skates extremely well for a player his size. If there weren't some consistent negatives hanging on him, he'd have all the capabilities to be in the top five of this class. One of the negatives is that he can be a non-factor off the puck. Historically, he's had a tendency to shy away from physical play, and his defensive effort isn't good, although the latter area showed significant improvement in the second half of this season. His work ethic on and off the ice have been criticized, but Brown seemed to take those critiques to heart, and really impressed in the past few months. If he maintains that trend, he could be a game-breaking center.",,,,,,," Brown has all the tools to be an impact playmaker at the next level. Despite his towering size, he doesn't play a powerful, speed-driven, in-your-face game, but he does use his frame
to protect the puck and plays a solid all-around game. He has loads of speed tucked away in those
long strides, but you almost rarely see him hit 100%. Brown is a smooth skater with a strong center
of gravity, making it extremely diffcult for opponents to move him off the puck or knock him around.
Even with the puck and stretched out, he still maintains power and stability as he stays balanced
and upright through contact. Brown is a very fuid skater with quick lateral movements that belies
a kid with his size. He displays impressive hockey sense and overall awareness with and without
the puck. When holding the puck down low in the offensive zone, Brown has solid recognition of
what his teammates are doing and is quick to cycle with the man coming in behind him, knowing
exactly when the man is approaching and timing the drop pass right. He possesses soft hands
and is skilled with the puck. Brown makes it very hard to take the puck off him, especially on
the wall when he uses his back to push checks off. Away from the puck, he is a workhorse
as he attempts to get the puck from the man, not easing off until he forces his opponent to
turn it over or Brown strips him of it. He has a quick wrist shot, and is quite deceptive as he
doesn't always get into a shooting position so goalies don't expect a shot coming off the
blade. He has a nose for the net and will make his presence known in front of the crease,
while standing his ground and not allowing his opponent to move him. Brown's passes
are hard, crisp and lead the man through lanes. He has the ability to see lanes develop
and make the pass. He adjusts his body perfectly to receive the pass on a give-andgo, quickly feeding his man right back. In the faceoff circle, Brown uses his strength
to his advantage to tie up his man and prevent him from taking control. Defensively,
Brown picks up his check and plays a good game down low, pushing his check to
the outside and plastering him into the wall if necessary to separate the man from
the puck. Brown is not as physical as we would like from a 6-foot-6
power center, but that is just not his style of game. He needs to continue to shoot
the puck more and on a consistent level as he goes through stretches where
he looks hesitant to fre it on net, instead looking for much lower percentage
plays. Lastly, he will still need to add considerable strength, especially to his
spindly legs as the kid just keeps growing. "
2016,C,74,185,12,NJD,,Michael McLeod,"The Mississauga native had a very good season for the Steelheads. He is a highly-skilled and competitive center who brings a lot of elements to the table.

McLeod has above-average skill possession, good hand-eye coordination, a solid level of creativity and can move the puck well to his teammates. He brings a physical component to his game, and while not a defensive stalwart, he is quite solid defensively for a player his age, projecting as a two-way center as a pro. The main concern for McLeod is how high his offensive upside is, and if his instincts, vision and overall IQ are high-end enough to create enough offense without his big speed advantage once he reaches the NHL.",,,,,,,"McLeod is a high-pace, feet-footed, two-way center who does an exceptional job of
moving the puck around, creating time and space, and opening shooting lanes. He displays his quick
thinking to adjust his position by even a few inches to be in a better position for a pass or one-time
opportunity. He possesses a quick frst step and generates all kinds of speed as he weaves his way
up ice with the puck. McLeod picks up speed with every step, has big-time acceleration and makes
good use of his edges to cut and twist gracefully. His speed with the puck doesn't fade, but actually
increases in some instances, and he displays excellent separation speed on the rush. He is strong
on the puck and will hold onto it for as long as needed. McLeod shows some strength as he uses
his back to fend off the check and gain ground to get to an area that he deems as his best opportunity to distribute the puck for a quality scoring chance. He possesses a set of quick hands that
allows him to dangle defenders inside and out if he so chooses. McLeod sees lanes develop
and is patient to hit his man at the right time. This competitive center shows his strength in the
faceoff circle, winning key draws time and time again. His defensive game really stands out
as he is excellent in his positioning, helping low and playing well positionally. He is also quick
to cover for missed checks. He impresses with his commitment on the backcheck, making
it a priority to get on the right side of the puck to knock the man off of it. McLeod is quick to
offer support down low on the wall, immediately getting on the defensive side of the puck
and being there when the puck pops free. On the penalty kill, McLeod is sent over the
boards to take key faceoffs. He anticipates the play exceptionally well and makes great
use of his stick, quickly lunging and using his stick to intercept the pass and send it the
length of the ice. He will sacrifce his body and dive into the lane to block shots and
prevent an opportunity at the net. His competitive nature is on display each shift and
there is no quit in his game until the fnal buzzer sounds. McLeod's frame has plenty of room to add muscle and he
needs it as his legs are thin, even for the OHL level. Despite his spindly legs, he
does skate very well and the added muscle would help his balance, puck protection, physicality and shot velocity more than it would his already elite-level
skating. Like most young prospects, his game is inconsistent as he fashes
high levels of play and also disappears for stretches at a time. Lastly, we see
him as a playmaker-type who makes solid plays with the puck, but quite often, he makes a blind pass that just leaves our evaluators scratching their
heads as to his motive. "
2016,D,72.75,173,13,CAR,,Jake Bean,"Bean was one of the top defenders in the WHL this season, which is pretty incredible given that he was never drafted into the WHL and has improved by leaps and bounds. ""NHL hockey sense, he's got it,"" one NHL GM said. Bean processes the game so well, and when he gets the puck he moves it quickly and into the right spots. He never gets pressured into bad calls by fore-checkers, evading checks and maintaining possession very well. He's certainly an offensively tilted player, with above-average hands, and high-end vision on top of having a quality shot. Bean has improved his skating a lot from 12 months ago, but his first step or so is still a little slushy. Despite average size and skating, he's still a decent defensive player due to his hockey sense, and could potentially play on a second PK unit at his peak in the NHL; however, he's not a real physical defender.",,,,,,,"Bean is a pure offensive-minded blueliner who is always pushing the offensive pace.
He consistently uses his vision to spot teammates and transition the puck at an elite level. He emphasizes being a pass-frst defender, although he has the elusiveness and speed to jump up in plays or
lead a rush. Scouts like what he can do with his feet. He has a long, powerful skating stride which, on
the surface, appears to be slightly clunky and sluggish, especially when accelerating, but he really
is moving fast and covering a lot of ice. He resembles a bar of soap in his ability to avoid contact at
will. He protects the puck very well and has nifty hands, highlighted by his illustrious passing skill.
He processes plays very quickly and makes strong reads off the line to either pull up for a shot or
to venture deep into the zone. Bean has a very accurate wrist shot that is consistently on net and
he can also uncork a beauty of a one-timer. His shot off the line is usually on net and he makes
quick adjustments to make sure that he is able to maximize its effectiveness. He has the puck
a lot, but doesn't get caught over-handling. He's just as likely to rush the puck as he is to drop
a dime of a breakout pass on a streaking teammate's stick. He isn't the most physical player
or profcient defensively, but it doesn't seem to be an issue because whenever he gets the
puck, it is headed the other way in a hurry. The strength in his game outweighs the deficiencies. He reminds us a little of Erik Karlsson in that aspect. He always has the puck and is
always moving forward, which limits the amount of time he has to spend defending. Bean is a special offensive player, but at the same time, he is a bit
too scrambled defensively and soft for us to make him one of our top 10 prospects for
this draft. He has a tendency to wander defensively in hopes of making a difference
by, for example, vacating his post in front of the net while his partner is in a scrum
along the wall. He is too passive physically and leaves his gaps far too wide to be
effective defending the rush. Bean looks indecisive at times without the puck and
it leads to untimely mistakes. We believe that he will beneft from adding mass to
his frame that will allow him to hang in battles longer and more effectively. There
is a defnite risk element to some of his reads when he joins the rush or drives
down deep in the offensive zone. Bean will need to be paired with a very safe
defensive partner to be effective and to mitigate his risk."
2016,D,72.5,199.3,14,BOS,,Charlie McAvoy,"McAvoy was one of the better freshmen in the country this season, as he served as a key puck-moving defenseman for his team and played a lesser role for the Americans at the WJC. He put up some huge point totals for a freshman, but a fair amount of that was buoyed by secondary assists. McAvoy is an offensive defenseman at heart, and he excels when he has the puck on his stick. He skates very well and shows a lot of ability to evade pressure and lead a rush. He's a pretty effective power-play quarterback, with above-average or better hands and vision. Defensively, he'll have good and bad days. He's not spectacular at checking good players or playing the body with force, and he is prone to brain cramps in his positioning and decision-making. He won't be leaned on as the first guy over the boards to kill a penalty, but it's very possible he could skate top-four minutes at his peak.",,,,,,,"McAvoy is a high-upside defenseman who primarily plays an offensive game. He is
very strong on the puck. The main thing that leads to his puck-possession success is that he keeps his
feet moving through contact. He shows off his slick hands and ability to deke through a few defenders
and keep the puck. He has quick decision-making ability both with and without the puck. McAvoy often catches the defense off-guard because he makes quick plays with the puck, as if he knows what
he is going to do with the puck before he even gets it. He is able to do everything at high speed,
such as dishing a crisp pass without having to slow down to process his options, hitting the open
man through a seam in traffc. He is constantly making solid defensive plays, using his reach and
his strength to get to the man and separate him from the puck. His gap control is strong and he
quickly steps up to eliminate a passing option, play the puck or completely play his man to the
outside and out of harm's way. He is a forward-thinker who sees the ice well and analyzes the
game exceptionally well. McAvoy sees lanes develop, and if he doesn't like his options, he
moves quickly to get a different angle and distribute. He is a smooth skater, making it look
effortless at times. Quick mobility and agility allow him to pounce on his man or get up ice in
a hurry. McAvoy exudes confdence and is strong with the puck, not allowing others to get
after it. Controlled movements and smooth mobility make him highly effective in possession. He is deadly in transition as he makes on-the-money passes to options who will kickstart the rush. McAvoy has a nice gear he can tap into, and uses it wisely and effectively.
Defensively, he smartly uses body positioning to angle off forwards and prevent any big
plays in one-on-one rush situations. McAvoy has the ability to also play the body and
will line up a hit if the opportunity is there. He will also use his strength to push his man
out of the crease area or to wage battle along the wall. McAvoy is a guy who really does not have an elite trait about
him—except maybe his skating. His passing game is on-point and his awareness
is solid, but he really does not have that one area that defnes him as a player. He
can, at times, over-handle the puck and run out of options, being overly patient
with the puck. McAvoy will also want to focus on being more defensive-minded
and not always jump into the rush, and make better reads on when to do so.
He needs to bring the same consistent effort to the defensive side of the game
as he does to his puck-moving and offensive game."
2016,C,71.25,192.72,15,MIN,,Luke Kunin,"Kunin was Wisconsin's best player this season as a freshman, and generated insane shot totals for a player in his first season, nearly hitting the 4.0 mark per game. He's such an easy player to admire, because he's such a well-rounded player. Kunin's speed is above-average, and on occasion I've seen him touch a real separation gear as well. He plays with skill and intensity, showing the ability to go around and through defenders. His hockey IQ is also a positive attribute, although he can sometimes force some bad decisions. Kunin shows impressive vision, on top of being aware defensively and a capable penalty killer. Finally, Kunin features a plus shot, being a feared goal scorer at the NCAA, USHL and international levels. There really isn't a ton to nitpick in the Missouri native's game, other than he probably won't be an NHL game breaker, but I definitely can see him making a long career of some form in the league.",,,,,,,"Kunin is a mature, smart, speedy goal-scoring centerman. He possesses elite-level
offensive hockey sense and reads the play two to three steps ahead of everybody else. He possesses
maybe the quickest frst steps of all 2016 draft eligibles and is at full speed in two to three steps. After
his lightning-quick acceleration, his top-end speed is special. When he gets to the NHL, he will immediately be one of the fastest players in the league. Kunin displays impressive vision and a great
touch when playing the puck into space for teammates; he can make some creative dishes. He
possesses a dangerous one-timer. Kunin also has a wicked backhander that he releases in Crosby-like fashion. His shot is probably his greatest asset, and that is saying a lot when you compare
it to his incredible speed and extraordinary vision. He is all over the place in the offensive zone,
tracking down the puck and jamming at it in the crease, or driving through the slot to the net.
He will do whatever it takes to put his team on the board. A slick possession player, Kunin has
quick hands and the ability to get creative, deking around defenders and goaltenders when
he feels comfortable doing so. Defensively, he does a great job of using an active stick to
create turnovers and is successful in knocking the puck away from opponents. He is always
willing to block shots and pay the price to help his squad. Kunin is a clever player with good
instincts. He thinks the game a step ahead of the play and uses his anticipation to generate
scoring chances. Kunin played the off-wing on Wisconsin's frst line this season, but took
and won a lot of big draws. He is an ace in the faceoff circle, and was also on Wisconsin's frst penalty kill and power play units, playing big minutes as the youngest player
in college hockey. With just average size, Kunin has a non-stop motor and plays
with a little recklessness, leading to some questions about potential durability issues
at the NHL level. While he has some strong two-way potential for the next level,
at times he cherry picks and sits in between the blue and red lines looking for the
long stretch pass before coming back into his defensive zone. When he did this,
Wisconsin would be outmanned down low and their opponents were able to generate scoring chances. He also needs to work on his breakout stretch passes.
He had a few get intercepted this season, creating some solid chances for his
opponents. He backchecks hard, but does take some shortcuts. We like his
game a lot, but do wonder what his upside will be at the next level."
2016,D,74,199.86,16,ARI,,Jakob Chychrun,"Jakob has been on the prospect radar for years, as one of the top players in the 1998 age group for a while; that includes his being the top pick in his OHL draft year. Chychrun was one of the better defenders in the OHL this season. He's a high-end skater, with excellent agility. Chychrun has above-average skill, and while he isn't a dangler, he can evade pressure well and move the puck very effectively on the man advantage. Chychrun thinks the game pretty well defensively. He's an advanced positional player, and given his very strong frame and great work ethic, he is a very reliable penalty killer. Offensively, he shows the ability to move the puck well and make some skill plays, but he can make some bad decisions and doesn't show high-end creativity.",,,,,,,"Chychrun is a physically developed, two-way defenseman who drives the play. He
loves to skate the puck up ice, but knows his limits as he is fast to retreat at the frst sign of a possession change. The son of former NHLer Jeff Chychrun, he is a smooth, mobile, effortless skater with
fuid movements and incredible all-round mobility. He uses his edges with precision to explode off the
start and change direction in a fash. His movements in every direction are powerful, smooth and
controlled. Quick bursts of acceleration make Chychrun a threat from being stationary as he explodes and moves in a hurry. A smart defender who defends well in all areas, he does a very good
job of angling his check wide to the outside upon entry and has good timing with his stick and
knows when to step in with the body. He isn't going to step in and level a player on every play,
but he will use his frame consistently to his advantage in outmuscling the man from the puck
and removing him from it entirely. Chychrun possesses incredible hockey sense and adapts to
his surroundings quickly and effectively. He reads the play very well and does the little things
right with and without the puck. He acts like a general on the ice, guiding his backcheckers on
whom to cover. He controls passes with poise, reading the developing play, quickly adjusting
his positioning and opening his body to receive the pass; he receives it as smoothly as can
be before turning his attention to distributing or getting it to the net. Chychrun thinks quickly
to be able to control the pass and turn to the net with a quick stickhandle and hard wrist
shot. He settles bouncing pucks with poise and speed as he continues up ice or laterally
with no hesitation. Chychrun will go to war on the wall to get the puck off the man, and
makes no mistake in getting it out of traffc to open space. With the puck, he shows off
his creative side, making a few little moves to get by opponents. He has a big, heavy
shot that he gets all of his weight behind and has no trouble blasting. Consistency is an area that has been an issue for Chychrun as
one game he looks near perfect making all the right decisions and reads, while
other games he makes a couple big gaffes that would have others looking for
a place to hide. The good news is that he does not make excuses or hide from
these, but instead learns from his mistakes. Knowing when to step up to make
a play and when not to force something that is not there looks like it could be
the big hurdle facing him. Sometimes, he skates himself out of options when
rushing the puck. This leads some scouts to question his offensive sense and
awareness, but we think that is also part of his learning process. "
2016,D,72.5,191.98,17,NSH,,Dante Fabbro,"An outstanding two-way defenseman who was the best defenseman in the BCHL this season, Fabbro also had strong showings in international play. His hockey IQ is among the best in this draft class. The way Fabbro moves the puck dictates the tempo of the shift. His passes are accurate but also very crisp, as he puts his full weight into a lot of his breakout passes. He's so calm and aware on his outlets, and is a decent skater, which lets him rush the puck up as well. Fabbro can QB a power play, and has some creativity in his game.

He's got a decent frame, will engage his checks physically and is a quality positional player. There's an occasional mistake on that end, but for the most part he's a pretty sound player. He is committed to play next season at Boston University.",,,,,,," Fabbro is an ultra-intelligent, defensively safe rearguard. He is very steady and calculated in his decision making. He doesn't throw the puck away and he has ice in his veins. He does
not have much of a dynamic fair in the way he distributes the puck, but he is very effective and accurate in his puck movement. Fabbro always hits the tape and he makes teammates better players
by delivering the pucks in a timely fashion. He makes very composed plays, moving the puck out of
his end and in transition. He can make a quick pass up to his winger or hold onto it and wait until
passing lanes open up for him to spot another forward in the center lane or across the ice. On
the power play, Fabbro shows he can move on the line to open shooting lanes, and he regularly
performs switches with his defense partner, looking for open lanes for him to get a shot off. He
has a real bullet of a point shot that is a good mix of hard and well-placed. He is a master at
shaking off forecheckers breaking out and even controls the puck while using one hand on the
stick and one hand to protect. He can get passes off under physical pressure on regroups or
breaking out. Fabbro offers an all-around game that some of the more prolifc puck-rushers
lack, particularly on the defensive side and playing with composure under pressure. Fabbro
is extremely tough to beat one-on-one because he'll play the body and stay square to the
player coming in on the rush. Away from the puck, he can keep forwards honest with a
slash across the body as he's tracking them in the defensive zone. He has impressive
vision and defensive awareness, showing the ability to cover for missed assignments of
others. We heard an NHL general manager say he could see Fabbro playing in the NHL
next year and we don't think that's inaccurate at all. He had a very solid season on his
way to being named the top defenseman in the BCHL. The top thing that NHL teams need to know when considering
Fabbro is that he will never be a fashy, offensive, puck-rushing defenseman no
matter what the offensive numbers he put up suggest. He is more safe than fash
and dash, and he will not take the puck end-to-end. He could stand to move his
feet more to aid in his escapability and alleviate pressure from the forecheck. He
lacks creativity with the puck as he just keeps the play going forward instead of
using his skill and feet to loop back and regroup to get a better look or route.
Fabbro certainly has the skill to be more creative if he wants to. Physically, he
is not the strongest guy, but he is forced to play smarter to compensate."
2016,D,79,224,18,WPG,,Logan Stanley,"The massive blueliner has been a lightning rod in the prospect community for a number of years, with a wide variance of opinions. I've heard scouts who wouldn't use a pick in the first two rounds on him, and others who consider him a top-10 talent. He stands 6-7 and is a pretty impressive skater and puck mover for such a big man. He's not particularly dynamic in either area, but he shows a quality athletic toolkit. Stanley leans on opponents with his large frame to win battles and gets in shooting lanes pretty well, and disrupts play with his long reach. Stanley's hockey IQ isn't sublime; while he's not a liability there, he doesn't display top-end puck-moving instincts to make him a real power-play threat. There's some offensive upside, but it's pretty evident how his bread will be buttered.",,,,,,,"Stanley is a towering and lengthy rearguard whose bread and butter is blocking shots and
angling off his man. Overall for a big man, he really has improved his skating, but still needs to
control his feet a little more and be quicker yet. Stanley can be caught fatfooted, and also exposed on turns and pivots by smaller, agile forwards. Stanley possesses some shockingly good
puckhandling skills for a kid his size. He makes smart little plays to advance the puck, skating it
if he needs to and passing at the right time. He has shown more confdence in leading the rush
up ice as this season has progressed. When he skates the puck up ice, he uses his free arm to
his advantage to push the check off of him and gain space to work with. Stanley really uses his
reach and strength well. Defensively, Stanley needs to be a little more aware of where he is as
he tends to block his goalie's lane to see the puck, screening him more often than not. Stanley
closes the gap well, and is quick to step forward and use his reach to his advantage in knocking
the puck away. He makes very good reads to lunge forward and poke at the puck and/or intercept the pass. He uses that long reach to settle pucks quickly and effectively. He plays strong on
the perimeter, bringing a hard-nosed game as he gets physical with the puck carrier. The physically imposing defender has the ability to jump up and drop his shoulder to deliver a perfectly
timed, devastating check in open ice. Stanley will drop the gloves and stand up for his team"
2016,LW,72,197.32,19,NYI,,Kieffer Bellows,"Bellows, son of former No. 2 overall pick (1982) Brian Bellows, has been one of the top players in the USHL for the past two seasons. He's followed a unique path. After skating for Sioux Falls of the USHL in 2014-15, he joined the USA Hockey National Team Development Program (USNTDP) for his second season of eligibility, and was the under-18 team's second-best player this season; he currently ranks among the best goal scorers ever in the program. Stylistically, Bellows is a scoring power winger. He's got a sturdy, developed frame, plays with an edge and brings a lot of offensive tools to the table. He shows above-average puck skills and offensive hockey sense, and has a high-end shot. In fact, he was a shots machine this season, with one of the highest shots-per-game rates in the USHL. However, Bellows' skating has been a consistent issue in his game. He just doesn't have any sort of explosiveness in his stride. His defensive play isn't too great either, which may be a product of his skating as opposed to any work ethic issues. He has committed to Boston University for next season.",,,,,,,"Bellows—the son of former NHLer Brian Bellows—is the perfect example of a “meat
and potatoes”-type player. He plays the game the right way, gets involved in the dirty areas, plays physically and has a drive to succeed. Bellows has a knack for driving to the net, and throwing the opposition off with his deceptive shoulder dips and quick, two-step acceleration. He plays a power-forward
style of game, and engages physically, whether by making a check on defense or posting up in the
slot for screen attempts. Bellows plays with intensity and drive, a great mix of skill and strength,
and is really adept at knowing when to dangle a defender or bull-rush the net. He brings a diverse
and mature offensive skill set. Bellows protects the puck very well and is tough to separate from
it. He also has a knack of exploiting defenders who over-commit in an attempt to gain leverage.
Bellows is dynamite along the wall and goes to tough, high-scoring areas. Despite not being
big by NHL standards, he is very physically mature and imposes his will on the ice. Bellows is
a natural goal-scorer and possesses a heavy shot. He knows it's a weapon and isn't afraid to
pull the trigger from anywhere in the offensive zone. He's mastered the lost art of the high-velocity backhand; goalies need to be wary anytime he has the puck on his stick in close. Bellows also has an understated intelligence in the offensive zone: he seems to always be in
the right place at the right time, and he fnds soft spots to get open for one-timers. He plays
with a dogged determination, is relentless in puck pursuit, exploits mistakes and wins battles. He also shows a bit of a mean streak and isn't afraid to mix it up at all. : Bellows is not the most creative guy and needs to be paired with a playmaker to get the most out of his straightforward skill set. He is more of a complementary goal-scorer than the guy who gets it done on his own. While his skating has
improved dramatically over the past season, it still seems somewhat sluggish and
he could still use some improvement in his foot speed and edge work before he
dreams of getting to the next level. His passing instincts with the puck could also
be refned."
2016,D,73,177.4,20,DET,,Dennis Cholowski,"Cholowski was Chilliwack's best puck mover this season, and while he's a long-term project type of prospect, he does have the upside to make an NHL's team patience worth it. Cholowski has above-average offensive tools across the board. He has the top speed to be able to rush the puck effectively and can evade pressure off his edges just fine. Cholowski is a very smart puck mover, showing good poise on his outlets and power-play decisions. He possesses solid coordination with the puck and can execute above-average passes. Cholowski's physical game, however, is a significant issue. He is undersized and can have a real tough time winning one-on-one battles. Defensively, he's not a world killer, either. He is committed to St. Cloud State starting in the 2017-18 season.",,,,,,,"Cholowski is an extremely raw young defenseman. He is very thin and undeveloped physically. He is an elegant skater who moves around the ice with great footwork and fuidity. While
clearly lacking in strength, he still is able to zig-zag around the ice powerfully. His edge work is
great, and once he builds more power he will be a dominant skater. He maintains good angles
off the rush and has a great stick. He consistently breaks up plays with great stick positioning
and makes it diffcult for players to generate offense by constantly pestering puck carriers. His
anticipation is seen at both ends of the rink as he quickly steps in front of lanes to thwart attacks,
and also quickly identifed transitional opportunities to jump start his team's offensive attack.
Cholowski shows great vision through the middle of the ice and is a constant threat to expose
mistakes with his quick identifcation of developing opportunities. He handles the puck deftly
and uses his long reach to change passing angles. Cholowski has a very weak shot from the
point, but that is something that can improve with time. He has everything that is very diffcult
to teach—anticipation, instincts and a long, athletic stride with great edges. On the other hand,
everything that he lacks—such as strength and defensive positioning—can be taught. He has
great upside as an all-situations puckmover with the smarts to create offense"
2016,RW,75,230.62,21,CAR,,Julien Gauthier,"Gauthier was one of the top goal scorers in the CHL this season, and he was the only draft-eligible player to make Team Canada's team at the WJC. Gauthier is an exciting and dynamic scorer who brings a lot of plus physical attributes to the table. He is a 6-foot-4 forward who is a good skater, and I'd classify him as a high-end one for a big man. Gauthier is a highly skilled puck handler who can dangle and create highlight-reel plays. Gauthier uses his size, competes for space and pucks well, and gets to the dirty areas. His defensive game could use some work, though, as he can be a little loose on his positioning.",,,,,,,"Gauthier is a mammoth winger with a nose for the net. This ftness freak plays a very
simple game. He has a long and powerful skating stride that allows him to get to any spot on the ice
in time to be involved in the play. His skating is pretty impressive, considering that he has that big
frame to move around. Gauthier's frst steps are pretty good so he can reach his top speed quicker
than most other big guys his age. He has skilled hands and a power game, allowing him to either
carry the puck on his hip on the way to the crease or deke his way around a defender with a slick
move. Gauthier is impossible for QMJHL defenders to move in front of the net and he is highly
effective at that spot on the power play. He is a net-front presence who slides out into the slot
to receive passes opportunistically. Gauthier hops on loose pucks with his long stick and has a
dangerous shot that he gets a lot behind. He also utilizes his reach to sweep the puck around
defenders and goaltenders when rebounds are available in the crease area. He dominates his
opponents with big hits. Every time he had the chance to fnish his checks, Gauthier did and
he hit hard. He is strong and uses his size effectively in puck battles. A physical presence in
his own zone, he removes his mark from the puck along the boards with a hard check or
just by being stronger than his opponent. He reads the play well and knows where to be
to cut a passing or shooting lane. Gauthier possesses the willingness to drop in front of a
shot or take a whack to clear the puck. He is a solid crease-crashing, shoot-frst scoring
option on the wing with an NHL frame and athleticism. His game should translate well at
the next level if he can bring up his intensity. Gauthier's intensity is up and down. He's not always the confdent
power winger who forces his will on his opponents, although when he is that guy, he
is highly effective. Will he be more Jamie Benn or Steve Bernier? That is the question. His main faw, is that he could be more active in the defensive zone. It's not
that Gauthier doesn't know what to do or who to watch out for, but it's just that he
does not play with the same amount of urgency in his zone that he does when he
is on the offensive attack. The hands, though skilled and creative, are inconsistent as he can also have trouble handling a pass, bobbling the puck. He also
has to work at handling and receiving pucks in his feet. He does have some
strong legs and produces some impressive straight-line speed, however, he
is primarily a north/west skater, with limited lateral movement at this time."

His skills aren't elite, but he shows good hands and is able to create space for himself. His hockey IQ is very impressive, as he displays great patience with the puck, sees his options well and always finds himself involved with the play. Rubtsov is a fierce competitor in puck battles and, despite having a lean frame, is able to win a fair amount of them. He's also a quality defensive center, who has been leaned on all season in critical defensive situations, and is often a threat to score shorthanded. Though he and the rest of his teammates were disqualified from the under-18 world championships, it's hard to see his draft stock slipping too much.",,,,,,,"Rubtsov is a highly intelligent contributor all over the ice.

highly competitive kid. He can be a dominant puck-possession guy, a strong puck-distributor, a fnisher,
a defensive specialist and even a pest at times. He has strong skating ability, as he is fast and agile; he
uses his skating on both sides of the puck. The Russian center plays a complete game and commits
defensively, getting back and being hard on his man at all costs. Rubtsov gets back with speed and
can break up plays unexpectedly from behind with a quick stick lift and puck scoop. He continuously
makes great defensive plays before turning back up ice. Rubtsov seems to always be on the puck,
and when he is not, he is relentless in getting on it. He pounces on opportunities, taking advantage of loose pucks and time and space, and has an impressive ability to create something out
of absolutely nothing. He is strong on the puck and possesses unexpected soft hands in tight.
Rubtsov uses his size and strength to protect the puck and fend off incoming checks all while
maintaining possession and getting himself in position to try a shot or pass. He uses his long
reach to his advantage to break up plays as well as pull the puck back in tight to his body and
away from opposing players; he also uses it to keep the puck a distance from the check,
increasing his ability to protect it in open ice. Rubtsov has deceptive speed and is quite
shifty while moving full steam ahead, making excellent use of his edges to move laterally.
He possesses incredible hockey sense, reading the play well and adapting accordingly,
showing no quit in his game. Rubtsov picks his spots very well and has a high-velocity
shot that he can get off as he moves toward the net, keeping the puck away from his
body just enough to unload. He has a creative mind, and can fnd his man in traffc with
crisp tape-to-tape passes. Rubtsov's on-ice vision, awareness of the game and work
ethic are probably his biggest strengths. It's kind of nit-picking a little as Rubtsov is such a hard-working
guy and tries to do everything well, but he will need some coaching and strength
work on his faceoff ability. He does get involved in physical battles, but not consistently as sometimes he would rather use his stick than fnish a hit along the
boards. Rubtsov would be better served to bring the physical element more consistently as he is a force when he is using his body and playing with an edge."
2016,C,75,176,23,FLA,,Henrik Borgstrom,,,,,,,,"Borgstrom is a unique forward because he doesn't seem to be that fashy scorer, but he
still put up almost a goal per game this year. He is a great playmaker who displays speed,
sound offensive instinct and a solid frame to build muscle on as he gets more mature. He's an
entertaining player to watch because he can slow the game down and will make plays that are
hard to anticipate. Borgstrom can dangle, even when there are two or three opposing players
defending him. He has a decent wrist shot with a quick release. In the faceoff dot, he excels
at winning important puck drops and can even retrieve the puck back from a faceoff lost. On
the fipside, the Finnish forward must avoid being caught fat-footed in the defensive zone and
do a better job of covering his man more tightly in his own zone. He isn't particularly physical,
but he relies more on his stick and positioning to defend. Moreover, Borgstrom needs to avoid
giveaways deep in the zone and fnd a way to escape from his coverage in the offensive zone
to have greater scoring chances. All in all, he is an intriguing forward with exceptional passing
and playmaking skills, but he has many areas to work on. The second-time eligible forward and
University of Denver commit—who was passed over in last year's draft after playing under the
radar at the U18 level—might be one of the more underrated prospects in this draft."
2016,LW,74,203,24,ANA,,Max Jones,"This season with London, Jones put up counting stats that were just OK, but don't be fooled by his lack of gaudy point totals. He is a legitimate top offensive talent. London was a loaded offensive team this season, and Matthew Tkachuk held down the top left wing spot, which relegated Jones to the second even-strength and power-play units. Jones is an above-average skater with a technically sound stride and very powerful first step. He is a coordinated puck handler with a fair amount of creativity and the ability to make defenders miss in open ice. Jones creates space on the ice very well with these attributes and is a tenacious worker with a strong frame and big shot. Jones has worked on his defensive play this season. His biggest remaining issues are discipline and decisions. He can cough the puck up at times, and he takes a lot of bad penalties, which shows that he can be pushed over the edge.",,,,,,," Jones is a throwback power winger who plays on the edge. He has an incredible work
ethic and drive, plus he loves the physical aspect of delivering devastating hits and engaging in the
rough stuff. He has some real skills in the offensive end as well. The feisty winger, who loves to get
under his opponents' skin, possesses a powerful stride as he digs his edges in to the ice to drive hard
to the net and/or separate from his check to be in a position for a pass, defection or rebound in tight.
He does not coast to the net, but instead goes in aggressively, at full-tilt looking to dig for pucks or,
at the very least, cause a stir with an ice shower to the goaltender. He is strong on his feet thanks
to a solid core and lower-body strength, which make it hard for him to be knocked off balance, and
he can gain tremendous speed with powerful strides northbound. Jones has some shiftiness with
the puck on his stick, using his edges to twist and turn, while using his back to protect the puck
from a check. He protects well using his top shoulder to gain leverage and stretch it out of reach
from the check while continuing on his drive to the net. His work ethic is impressive, as he is
driven to get the puck, and battle on the wall and in the corners. There's no quit on the puck
as he tries to keep control, but if and when it's taken from him, Jones fghts tooth and nail to
get it back. He has the ability to unload a very heavy wrist shot in a fash; one of his most
dangerous assets is his pro-type shot that can beat goaltenders anywhere in the offensive
zone. In the defensive zone, Jones is quick to pressure the point with an active stick. He
picks up his man and will cover for missed assignments. He is relied on to kill penalties,
showing his quickness to get on the puck carrier and pressure the points, while also
displaying his incredible work ethic. Jones is able to cause issues for the attacking
team deep in its own zone as he forechecks hard, pinning the puck deep in the offensive zone, and killing plenty of time by pressing the puck with his relentless stopping
and starting down low. He is a threat to score shorthanded as well as his incredible
speed and power can be too much for many power play point men to handle. Jones is the type of player who is incredible one shift and then
becomes invisible the next. Consistency will be the key to his future as he can be
a big-time player when he wants to be. He has the skill set to be a top pick, but
has consistency and discipline issues right now that will likely see him slide.
Defensively, specifcally during 5-on-5 play, he is inconsistent in picking up his
check and tends to be a little too focused and ready to explode out of his zone
with his eyes on offense. While he possesses a good mix of size and speed
that he controls very well, his puck skills are a little hit and miss; when he
tries to get overly creative, mistakes tend to arise."
2016,LW,77,211.16,25,DAL,,Riley Tufte,"Tufte played much of the season in the high school ranks for Blaine High (Minnesota), where he was outstanding (scoring 78 points in 25 games), even when you adjust for the lower quality of competition, compared to Canadian junior leagues or the USHL. Tufte measures in at around 6-foot-5, but he skates like a 5-foot-10 forward. He has an incredibly explosive stride and first step; combined with his frame, that makes him a headache for defensemen when he's coming down the wing. Tufte's hands are above average, with good hand-eye coordination for a big man and a quality level of creativity and vision. His defensive play was fine at the high school ranks, but against the higher level of competition in the USHL, some holes were exposed in the way he plays his position. As always with top high school prospects, questions of pace and quality of competition will loom over Tufte until he shows it at a consistent level versus better players. But given the struggles he has gone through, one has to be confident that he has the willpower to find a way to prove himself. He is committed to Minnesota-Duluth for the 2016-17 season.",,,,,,,"Tufte is a big power forward who has solid mobility and skilled hands. He is hulking
and rangy, able to move around defenders with a fuid stride and strong stick reach, which he uses to
protect the puck. He is most effective when he uses his big body to protect the puck. He possesses
very powerful frst strides, which he uses to rush through the neutral zone. Tufte is able to get rid of
back-pressing forwards with only two to three strides. His big size helps him to drive the net very
aggressively and successfully screen the goaltender. He is extremely hard for defenders to move
and he is present in after- whistle scrums. Given his size, Tufte has no reason to be afraid of board
battles and he wins most of them. He has very good sense of what each play calls for. He isn't
afraid to play a simple game if it means he will have success, as evidenced by his decisions to
chip and chase, beating the defender to the puck and setting up a teammate from the backdoor.
He could use his quick hands to try deking around defenders, but instead simplifes his play
if the situation calls for it. Tufte has a deadly wrist shot, which is NHL-quality in release and
velocity. What looks like an effortless fick of the wrist can become a lethal bar down snipe.
When he had the puck on his stick with a head of steam, there was nobody at the high school
level who could stop him. He uses his reach to his advantage in the defensive zone and
when picking up his man on the backcheck, extending his reach to wrap around the puck
carrier in an effort to get his stick on the puck. Tufte is a big power forward who can draw
defenders in and keep them off of the puck at the same time. He will help his future teams
offensively and as a power play threat deep in the offensive zone as he will fnd a way
to get the puck to the net at all costs. Tufte has been one of the tougher players to project in the 2016
draft class. He started the year in Fargo (USHL) and came back to play the high
school season after failing to score an even strength goal in 12 games (though he
did have fve power play goals). At the high school level, he is so dominant that
he looks out of place, like if you were to take a good junior player and drop him
in a bantam game. Tufte went on to win Mr. Hockey in Minnesota before rejoining Fargo to close out the season. That said, we are a believer in this guy. The
physical side of his game is where there are more questions. There is defnitely
room for him to get meaner and nastier. At the high school level all he had to
do is skate up to a player after the whistle and the player would skate away
out of intimidation. He is defnitely a longer-term development prospect. "
2016,C,77.5,195.22,26,STL,,Tage Thompson,"Thompson surged up draft boards this season after putting up big point totals as a freshman. While a lot of his scoring was due to heavy power-play production, which isn't always very predictive of talent, there is certainly a fair amount to like about Thompson's game. He's a skilled big man. Thompson shows the ability to make decent offensive plays, displaying strong coordination and puck-movement ability for a 6-foot-5 player. Thompson also has a big shot, often being used this season as a trigger man on the point for Connecticut. His defensive hockey sense is fair, as he was a quality penalty killer during his time with the USNTDP. His skating isn't the best, though. His speed isn't horrible for a big man, but he's not a burner at all. And despite his size, Thompson isn't the most physical player you will find in the draft.",,,,,,,"Thompson is a big, strong forward who plays more of a skill game than a power game.
In battles for loose pucks and along the boards, he does a great job using his body to shield the puck
and gain a winning position. However, when the puck is on his stick approaching or in the offensive
zone, he often opts for fash over power. Thompson likes to toe drag and try to go through the defender with skilled moves instead of around him with his reach and strength. His long reach does
play a part in his creative offensive mind. Skating wise, Thompson uses powerful strides to get up
and down the ice. He shows nice speed with and without the puck. He creates opportunities as he
drives the center lane without the puck. Thompson has a pro-ready shot that is hard and quick off
his stick. He will lay the body when he wants to, but he is not someone who will be overly physical. He does use his body to his advantage, to protect the puck in the offensive end before either
making a beautiful pass or getting off a hard shot. Thompson does a great job of cutting to the
middle, crossing the center of the ice and then shooting back across the goalie's body, forcing
him to make a diffcult save. He's also an extremely smart player in the offensive zone and
on the rush. Thompson is a talented player, but we believe that he is even smarter than he is
talented. He is the son of the current Bridgeport Sound Tigers head coach Brent Thompson.
Being the son of an AHL head coach (and former NHL assistant) has obviously made an
impact on what kind of player Thompson is. What impresses most about his defensive
game is how disciplined he is. After making a mistake, Thompson never repeats it. He
is rarely out of position and never over-pursues the puck. NHL teams will say is that his
higher ranking is more about what he could become than what he is right now, which
is true about all prospects pre-draft, but more so in the case of this raw, hard-working
talent. He has a nice stride, especially for a guy with his size, but if he
wants to dangle he will need to improve his edge work and overall agility. In the
games we saw him at center, we were not positive he is a ft for the position as
he becomes a pro. He struggles to win faceoffs regularly and his defensive zone
play was inconsistent. In our opinion, he is better suited on the wing where he
can still utilize his size and skill, but not feel so much pressure in his own zone. "
2016,C,74,189.82,27,TBL,,Brett Howden,"A top name in prospect circles for a number of years, Brett is nearly a carbon copy of his older brother, Quinton, a first-round pick of the Florida Panthers (2010) who played in 58 games for the club in 2015-16. Howden skates very well and displays an easy stride and great first step. He is a competitive, two-way forward who hustles for pucks every shift. With his size, character and hockey IQ, Howden is a very good defensive forward who has been leaned on by Moose Jaw to play critical defensive minutes. He's not a lights-out scorer, but he has some scoring tools. He'll show solid vision and shooting skills, though his hands and creativity aren't the best. He likely won't be a primary puck carrier on the power play as a pro, as he'll get more of his offense from being the main guy to gain the zone and win battles.",,,,,,,"Howden is a two-way performer who covers his bases. His hard work and dedication to the
fner details of the game make him a special asset to have on a winning team. He is an exemplary teammate who oozes leadership qualities with his demeanor and hands-on approach. Aside
from his intangible assets, Howden is a large-sized forward who can make an impact all over
the rink. He has tree-trunk legs and a powerful, yet swift, stride. His mobility and agility aren't
hindered by his size as he transitions smoothly and has few detriments with his skating. He has
an intelligent offensive mind with a well-rounded skill set. Howden sees the ice well and knows a
moment ahead of the play what he has to do. He sees passing lanes develop and hits his mark
on a consistent basis. He has quality puck focus and is able to carry play at a high level. When
Howden carries the puck, he uses a head of steam with strong protection skills to drag the puck
into and out of traffc. In our opinion, he is more of a passer than a shooter, although he has a
quick wrist shot with a snap release that really tests the goaltender. In his own zone, he is an asset, making smart plays and recognizing where he is best positioned. We would like to see him
add more mass to his frame so that he could be even more of a powerful specimen to deal with. "
2016,D,73.75,175.44,28,WSH,,Lucas Johansen,"took huge steps forward in his second WHL season, being one of Kelowna's most important players. He shows quality hockey sense, effectively moving the puck out of his end and on the man advantage. He doesn't have a ""wow""-level caliber of skill, but he always makes decisions with the puck to put his team in a position to succeed and is able to hold onto it for that extra second. He's very solid defensively, showing great work ethic to win pucks and get in lanes, as well as fine positional play. Johansen's biggest issue is his skating. He's notably below average in that department, with a sluggish stride, and he can get beat wide by quicker forwards.",,,,,,,"Johansen is a very calm and cool character on the ice. He is very intelligent and looks
comfortable at both ends of the ice. One thing that stood out is his prowess at holding the two
bluelines. His excellent gap control and unfappable nature forces a lot of lateral movement
by attackers. Johansen forces the attackers to make a move at the line, causing a handful of
offsides calls a game and generally plugging up the neutral zone. Johansen is also very accomplished in moving the puck forward and it's another area where his hockey IQ shines. He makes
some really clever plays and sees teammates when many others wouldn't. His touch on passes
is exceptional and he creates space by putting the puck in areas where only his teammates can
retrieve it. He has a projectable frame, but isn't very imposing in his own end. Position-wise, he
is pretty solid, using his stick well and keeping tight gaps and some pressure on the puck carrier.
He is not very physical in any area, and he needs to fght a lot harder for space and protect the
puck when he is backed into a corner. He gets the puck off his stick quickly and places it well on
the net. Johansen makes some good transition plays from in his own end when he is under a bit
of pressure. Defensively, he can be a bit iffy in puck retrieval, and he kind of deteriorates as the
pressure of the forecheck builds"
2016,C,73.75,203.98,29,BOS,,Trent Frederic,"A two-way center who was relied on to play key minutes, Frederic was inconsistent on the offensive end. He has a big, strong frame and is quite effective in one-on-one battles. He's a pretty good penalty killer who gets in lanes and wins pucks. He also is a short-handed scoring threat. He's got solid puck skills, even if he's not a spectacular puck handler. His skating, on the other hand, worries me a little. He's not really fast, relying on his power game -- as opposed to a quick burst -- to get to the net. He is committed to the University of Wisconsin starting next season.",,,,,,,"A University of Wisconsin commit for next season, two-way center Frederic was the second-line center for the NTDP U18s this season. The big power center displays a smooth, yet
powerful, stride in transition and remains balanced on his feet while in the offensive zone.
Frederic often shows his power game by opting to dump the puck deep into the offensive zone
before following it in to deliver a check on the puck-retrieving defender. He plays a tough game
and seems to enjoy the physical side of the game. Frederic plays hard in the corners, laying
big hits to create turnovers. His physicality does get him into some penalty trouble though.
Listed at 6-foot-2, he takes up a lot of space in front of the net in the offensive zone and goes
there regularly. He is not all brawn as he has the ability to make defenders miss solely with his
stickhandling ability entering the zone, before getting off a strong, accurate shot on net. Frederic is good at faceoffs and he does everything a coach could ask for: blocking shots, covering
his man tight and getting his stick into lanes in his own zone. He gets the puck to the net from
anywhere in the offensive zone by creating space with his stickhandling ability and size. He will
help his future teams in the offensive end, and can be trusted in the back end as well. We see
him transitioning nicely into the professional game; with his offensive skill, he will help any team
with point production as a second- or third-line, two-way guy."
2016,C,71,179.08,30,ANA,,Sam Steel,"After being a second overall pick in his bantam class, Steel underwhelmed at times this season but was pretty impressive overall. He's got above-average to top-end skating, hands and hockey IQ. He can play the game with a quick tempo and shows the ability to make defenders miss with his feet and hands, while also showing the vision to create for others. Steel is not one-dimensional, and he has shown decent defensive prowess by being an effective penalty killer for his junior team and for Team Canada at the Ivan Hlinka tournament. One downgrade for Steel was a notable inconsistency in terms of his offensive play.",,,,,,,"Steel is a high-IQ, zero-hesitation, puck-possessor who thinks at a high level and elevates
his teammates' play. He is noticeably one of the smoothest and skilled passers available in the
draft. His great peripheral vision and instincts allow him to jump on opportunities and fnd his
teammate's vacant stick blade. He loves to carry the puck and is a very skilled stickhandler. As a
smaller guy, Steel tends to play on the perimeter a lot, reducing his effectiveness as he could be
a real handful if he regularly took the puck into the trenches. To complement his great cognitive
and playmaking game, he also has a shot that is nothing to scoff at. Steel continually changes
his angle with his shifty play and has a quick release, making it a diffcult for goaltenders to pick
up. He is not a guy who anyone would classify as elite defensively, but he is reliable and can
be counted on to help out. He keeps his stick in a good position to pick up errant passes or
control puck movement. Steel gets low in his own zone to provide net-front support and makes
himself an open option on the breakout. His awareness is pretty good, although there are times
a quick play by the opposition will catch him off guard. He is very small, but engages in board
battles, digging for pucks, but not being very physical in doing so; instead, he relies more on his
stick. He's more of a puck-focused, push-and-shove guy instead of one who lines up to hit his
opponent. Steel is effective in creating offense, using his great agility and speed to make plays.
He is the Pat's top-line guy, and we see a potential top-six NHL contributor if he can improve
his strength."
2016,RW,76,185,31,TML,,Yegor Korshkov,"Korshkov got a lot of attention after a very good performance at the WJC, and he has been a decent bottom-six forward for his KHL team after going undrafted by NHL clubs the past two years. Korshkov is a towering power forward, with a strong 6-foot-4 frame that he uses to bulldoze his way to the front of the net and win many battles along the boards. He's a good skater for a man his size, showing excellent balance. Korshkov's hands won't dazzle, but he can make coordinated plays to avoid a check here or there. He'll move the puck at a fair level, and he isn't just a bump-and-grind big man.",,,,,,,"Korshkov is a big, rangy power winger. He uses his large frame to his advantage in protecting
the puck, to create his own working space and also to punish his opponents in the corners. He
still has plenty of room to add considerable mass and strength as he is quite wiry. He is very mobile on the ice and is able to apply good forechecking pressure deep in the zone. He has great
poise and puck control with soft hands; he's able to push defensemen back on their heels as he
challenges them. Korshkov has superior vision that allows him to dish terrifc passes, even while
at high speed. He is a constant threat around the crease because of his reach and puck skill.
His shot is very strong, but he does not use it enough. He has some defensive inconsistencies
in his game as one shift he can work hard to separate his opposition from the puck, support his
teammates as an option and win board battles, while other times, he looks disinterested in any
play inside his own blueline. The big Russian has played a lot of hockey this season and he
has done well at every level he has played. Whether it has been with Lokomotiv in the KHL or
with their MHL junior team, at the World Juniors, or in other international events, he has made
strong offensive contributions in every situation. The question becomes: Does an NHL team use
a draft pick on the twice-passed-over power winger, fully knowing he has at least two years left
in Russia or does he go the Artemi Panarin route of free agency after his KHL contract expires."
2016,LW,71.5,196.7,32,EDM,,Tyler Benson,"A former elite prospect for many years, Benson's season was upended from several injuries to his lower body and back. Even when he was playing, he was at 50 percent at the best of times. Benson has great instincts, constantly finding seams to get the puck to his teammates or on net. ""He never wows you,"" said one scout, ""but he's always around the puck, making a good play."" Benson is a quality defensive forward with great work ethic in battles and solid overall positional play. He doesn't shy away from throwing a hit, and is strong on the puck. His skating isn't superb, but I thought it was decent prior to this season, with the injuries possibly accentuating the issues. He has the tools to be a top-six forward in the NHL, but there are big risk factors attached to making him a first-round pick as well. I'm banking on a recovery and a return to top form next season, but he's clearly one of this class' biggest wild cards.",,,,,,,"Benson is a strong, pro-style player who plays a sound, two-way, reliable game. He
has a strong lower half that allows him to generate healthy amounts of speed. He is very sound in the
fundamental areas of the game that require a mix of power and agility. He is a confdent puck carrier
and effcient distributor of the biscuit. Benson's shot is hard and quick, and really effective down low.
He has some defnite fair and quickness in his hands that he uses to fool his opponents, although
he favors the no-nonsense north-south power game that keeps the pressure cooker cranked up on
opponents. He has a good motor, and is a competitor who wants the puck on his stick and knows
what to do when he gets it. He loves to be “the guy,” but he is not all that electrifying and doesn't
make many plays in the offensive zone that pull fans to the edge of their seats. He has a strong
drive and can quickly fnd his teammates, dishing off before going to the crease. Benson is
strong in the offensive zone without the puck, disrupting puck movement and getting physical
in battles for position. On the forecheck, he gets a bead on the defenseman with the puck and
hits him hard to separate him from the puck before getting it in around the slot for a chance.
Benson is a very good defensive player who always seems to be in the right spot and on top
of his man with the puck. He backchecks hard and has a good idea of what lanes he needs
to be in. He uses his stick well and commonly has a good angle on his man so that he can
deliver a solid hit. Injury derailed Benson's draft year and put some doubt in the minds
of more than a few scouts as to if he would develop as many thought he would after going frst overall in the WHL bantam draft. His work ethic and heart cannot be
questioned, but his hockey IQ leaves some questions. We sometimes question his
thought process in the offensive zone without the puck. Sometimes, Benson makes
decisions that limit his ability to generate offensive chances. He doesn't always take
advantage of the gaps afforded him or skate himself out of options. We are hoping
this is a product of the rust he played with this season due to long stretches of
sitting out with injury and not the real Benson."
2016,C,70.25,176.32,33,BUF,,Rasmus Asplund,"Although Asplund didn't translate his strong international play to great success in the SHL this season, he's still a pretty desirable prospect. There are split opinions on him within the industry, with some scouts seeing an NHL tweener and others seeing a player with a very good chance to become a top-six center. Asplund's best trait is his hockey sense. He's a creative, aware, two-way forward who creates with his hands and vision, on top of being positionally sound. Asplund is also an above-average skater with great agility on his edges and a good first step. His 5-foot-11 frame works against him, and his strength needs to go a long way before he's NHL-ready, but he shows the capability to be a solid defensive center, despite his size.",,,,,,,"Asplund is a classic, hard-working, two-way centerman who can handle all types of
situations in the game. His top speed is impressive and generated by a long stride for a smallish player.
He moves well in all directions. Asplund uses his good timing and anticipation in combination with his
speed, creating breaks up ice. His speed seems to surprise goalies as he get on the goalie quickly
and has the hands to make a move to beat them. Despite his stature, he protects the puck well and
does not fear contact. Asplund is a very skilled center who isn´t afraid to drive to the net and create
some offensive chances in front of the opposition's cage. He makes good passes in traffc with big
D-men all over him. Asplund makes some beautiful give-and-go plays on the rush, passing the
puck off to a short option, exploding into an open lane and receiving the pass back. The kid can
absolutely fy down the wing when he gets moving, and is a threat when he gains some momentum and confdence in his game. Asplund commands the ice in transition and while in possession, making opponents back off with some slick hands and skating, pushing them back.
He is dangerous as both a fnisher who can snap a nice wrister into the top corner or as a
playmaker who fnds his targets through seams. He shows impressive awareness and good
coverage in the defensive zone. Asplund has a willingness to work hard defensively before
moving the puck up ice. He will take a hit to deliver the puck. He blocks shots and takes
a lot of responsibility upon himself. Asplund has killer agility and a deadly frst step that
he uses in conjunction with his active stick and vision to cut all sorts of time and space
on the penalty kill. He works hard all over the ice, is very grounded, brings a steadying
infuence to his team and earns the respect and trust of his coach. Asplund isn't a high-end offensive generator, but is just a solid two-way contributor. He will do the job as a distributor of the puck if put with
a goal-scoring winger, but will not be that fashy, high-octane running-mate on a
team's top line. He is a nice two-way center, but his offensive upside at the NHL
level is a question. Asplund is a bit undersized and physically weak; he will need
to add plenty of strength both in his legs and upper body before even dreaming
of the NHL. He looks to be a little shaky in the faceoff circle, not being physically mature enough to tie up the opposing center and work through to draw the
puck back. Overall, if he can mature in his thinking of the 200-foot game and
add some strength, Asplund will fnd a role at the NHL level."
2016,D,75,200,34,CBJ,,Andrew Peeke,"The Florida native has impressed this season in the USHL and several international showings for the U.S. Peeke is a good skater and an extremely fluid and mobile player for a 6-foot-3 defenseman. He evades pressure well to create space on outlets and is able to join the rush fairly effectively. Peeke moves the puck well, showing solid vision and overall offensive instincts. His puck skills are poor, though, and in tight pressure, he can't skate away from challenges. Peeke's defense is fine, with his positioning being a slight issue, but his mobility, size and work ethic allow him to be a quality defender. He is committed to the University of Notre Dame starting next season.",,,,,,,"Peeke is a big-bodied defender who can play both sides of the puck. He possesses a smooth
stride and is able to change directions effciently. He is an excellent skater in both forward and
reverse, and makes sure that he is always facing an attack. Peeke uses his long stride to get to
places quickly and is seemingly never out of position. He controls the puck extremely well, rarely
turning it over or forcing unnecessary passes. Peeke is poised and able to handle the forecheck
pressure before making the smart play. He is very effective deep in his defensive zone—often
breaking the puck out—and he is responsible for creating effective transitions. His shot is on
display quite often as the late guy or on the point in the offensive zone, often throwing pucks on
net in hopes of getting a redirection or creating a rebound chance. Defensively, he is effective
against the opposition along the boards as he physically engages them, showing strong onpuck presence. He shows great awareness in all three zones, and is excellent at making a read
to jump up off the line or in the neutral zone to counteract an outlet pass from his opponents.
He is in control and has his head on a swivel reading the play as it comes his way. Peeke is a
big minute-munching blueliner who jumps over the boards in all situations. We describe him as
a guy with NHL size and stability to succeed in a middle-pairing role. He should develop into
a top-pairing guy at the NCAA level before transitioning into the professional game. The Notre
Dame commit is effective in all phases of the game at the USHL level, and looks to continue that
play as he develops with the Irish."
2016,C,72,169.48,35,STL,,Jordan Kyrou,"Kyrou had an up-and-down season. In his best moments, he shows high-end pro potential; in his worst stretches, he's invisible offensively and even a liability. His skating and puck handling are of the game-breaking variety, and he can create highlight-reel moments with the best of them. Kyrou often beats defenders to the outside with his speed and shows great edge work. Now, on to the bad: Kyrou has a slight build, is very shy in terms of physical play and often loses his 1-on-1 battles. He cheats defensively and can be a liability in his own end. There is a lot of risk and reward in his projection.",,,,,,,"Kyrou is a wiry, but creative and skilled, winger who blends impressive vision with tenacious
drive. He shows great hands and ability to maintain puck possession through traffc; showing
determination and fght to get it back if he does lose it. Kyrou tends to lean forward in his stride,
but has good speed with a powerful step. Has no quit in his game as he fies down the wing on
the rush or chases the puck. He sees lanes at high speeds and has the ability to dish with ease
as he moves north/south or east/west. Kyrou can go through stretches where he seems to be
doing a little too much with the puck, causing some turnovers. He has shown improved willingness and strength to drive toward the net from the corner, where he can dish a little give-and-go
or just drive the puck on net himself. He has a quick little release, but fails to always get his shots
through lanes, having his shooting lanes eliminated or shots blocked instead. He plays hard on
the forecheck and forces the puck carrier into making silly mistakes or moving the puck quicker
than he would have liked. Defensively, he picks up his check on the way back and plays him
hard, though this is a little inconsistent at times. He is quick to pressure the points with speed
and aggression. Kyrou is strong in the faceoff circle. A real character player, but he needs to put
all the tools together on a consistent basis."
2016,C,73,173.6,36,PHI,,Pascal Laberge,"The former second overall QMJHL draft pick is a highly talented and competitive forward. He brings a solid base of intangibles to the table, shows a good work ethic every shift and doesn't shy away when the energy level ratchets up a few notches. Laberge is an above-average skater with a very good top gear, which allows him to separate off the rush. He's a creative playmaker who can dangle and create the occasional highlight-reel moment as well as consistently set his teammates up for scoring chances. He's not the best defensively, which is concerning as a center, but I see him as a player trending upward.",,,,,,,"Laberge is an intelligent player who skates with a purpose. He analyzes the ice and
where he would be best suited to go to be most effective in each situation. He is a very quick skater
who is light on his feet. His short bursts allow him to gain the speed needed to be impactful all over the
ice. He has good vision and makes quick passes on tape from various ranges and angles. With soft,
quick hands, Laberge's puck skills are very good; he can beat players one-on-one and make goalies
look like peewee stoppers. His shot is quick and known by QMJHL goaltenders. He can also really
wire it to spots he wants with a deceptive release point. He is an underrated playmaker as he waits
for his teammates to make moves before hitting them with accurate passes. He creates a lot of
quality scoring chances and has a bit of an edge as he is fearless in the greasy areas. Laberge
provides good support for teammates in his own zone for quick breakouts; he does the same
in the offensive zone for good scoring chances. He likes to throw his body around and play
physically, winning his share of board battles. He dealt with some personal tragedy over the
past few months that caused some understandable inconsistency in his on-ice play earlier
this season. However, a switch went off during the second half Laberge brought a strong,
determined effort to the rink. It is hard not to pull for a kid like this who has dealt with loss
and continues to fght. He always seems to be in the right place at the right time away from
the puck, and he has the offensive instincts that will make him a threat as he gets bigger,
faster and stronger. Laberge needs to add some weight to his tall, lanky frame, which
will help him become more stable and more effective in board battles or when he is
trying to play with an edge. He has a desire to hit players, but he just doesn't have
the physical ability to fnish his checks hard. Laberge has very good top speed, but
we feel like he just needs to add more power in his stride as he is very mobile and
his acceleration would be very dangerous as he already has quick feet to help him
separate from backcheckers. Just like his skating, his shot is already strong, but
it could be even more dangerous if he could add more velocity by having more
muscle and weight to put behind it. His skating with the puck also needs some
improvement. Laberge tends to slow down with the puck and often looks to
be fghting it. He prefers to push it ahead of his body while skating instead of
keeping it close, losing some of his effectiveness when trying to beat a man
one-on-one through the neutral zone. "
2016,D,73.15,196,37,TBL,,Libor Hajek,"Hajek has been a top prospect for a few years. He was one of the top 16-year-old players in recent memory to be a regular in the top Czech league, and he was one of Saskatoon's best players this season. Hajek is a fantastic skater, one of the very best in this draft class. He closes his gaps well on his checks, evades pressure and is a threat offensively by activating off the point or jumping into the rush. He moves the puck efficiently, shows some creativity on the power play and is a steady positional player. He is also able to defend his off-wing very effectively. Hajek's hands aren't great, but his IQ lets him get his points, as he opens lanes so well with timing, patience and skating ability. Hajek has some room on his frame to bulk up, and he shows the intangibles to battle for pucks and throw his weight around.",,,,,,,"Hajek is a physical, two-way defenseman who displays great fundamentals. The Czech import understands his responsibilities and sees the ice well. He skates well and has great edges,
showing grace in turns and lateral movement. His speed allows him to skate pucks out of the
zone if he prefers and to keep air-tight gaps when approached on the rush. Hajek has a good
feel for his defensive zone and is great at scissoring threats off from getting to the net. He has
a great mind for what the offense is thinking and uses an active stick to get in passing lanes
or to poke unprotected pucks to a teammate. He plays an assertive style, using his strength to
gain body position in net-front confrontations or in board battles. He plays a lower-risk game
and really prides himself on the defensive aspect of the game. The quickness of his release and
accuracy of his shot make him effective, trumping the average velocity he gets behind his wrist
shot. He makes some smart decisions on the line, using mobility to sneak into the zone to make
himself an offensive option. He passes the puck beautifully. Hajek has some offensive skill, but
he doesn't use that skill set consistently. Once in a while, he will jump into a play where you can
see that he has the skill to join the rush with or without the puck, but prefers to remain focused
on his defensive role"
2016,LW,69,192.8,38,FLA,,Adam Mascherin,"One of the top-scoring under-18 players in the CHL this season, the former No. 2 overall pick in his OHL draft was a dominant player for long stretches. I polled a lot of scouts about Mascherin, and the common themes were ""goal scorer"" and ""elite shot."" While Mascherin can snipe it from a distance, he has other strong attributes to his game. He has above-average puck skills and shows great overall offensive instincts. Mascherin is able to find teammates, anticipate where the play is going and find ways to put himself in the right position. Overall, his team dominates the puck when he's on the ice. He's small, but he's a very strong and competitive forward who wins more battles than he should for a smaller guy. Mascherin's biggest flaw is his skating. He is a roughly average skater and notably below-average for a smaller player, in terms of his speed and first-step agility. This hinders his defensive play and prevents him from being too dangerous rushing through the neutral zone.",,,,,,,"This left winger is on the short side, but has a powerful, stocky build like Max Domi, and has
the ability to power his way around the ice. He has the vision to set up down low and on the
power play, picking apart lanes with seamless passes. He has taken his speed to another level
this season and has excellent separation speed in his arsenal. Mascherin possesses quickstep acceleration, which allows him to catch the puck carrier on the backcheck or create havoc
and pressure all over the ice. He can instantly change the speed in which he travels to ft his
attacking needs with the puck, aiding his ability to separate and quickly explode past defenders
on the outside. He plays with the puck on a string as he drives the play up ice, and can quickly
change the speed of his hands and slide to one single hand on the puck and back to two with
strong, controlled movements as he approaches a defender. Mascherin has the confdence,
and defnitely the ability, to get creative with the puck in the offensive zone and on zone entries.
He possesses incredible vision on the breakout, and the confdence to make smart passes with
pressure on, not seeming to be fustered by the pressure he takes. He has a quick little release
that shoots off the blade of his stick, making his rocket of a shot dangerous. He is strong on the
puck and isn't afraid to use his frame and pure strength to throw the body and protect the puck,
giving himself the room to escape the pressure and carry the puck the length of the ice"
2016,RW,67,165.36,39,CHI,,Alex Debrincat,"The diminutive DeBrincat has been one of the top scorers in the CHL during the past two seasons. Following 2014-15, there were lingering criticisms that summed up to ""that's all great, but he played on a line with Connor McDavid."" This past season, DeBrincat put a lot of those concerns to rest with a dominant campaign. He's a highly-skilled winger who shows above-average to high-end speed, puck skills, vision and finishing skill. DeBrincat is constantly buzzing around the ice making all sorts of offensive plays. His elite hockey sense allows him to be in the right place and control the puck with confidence. He was one of the very best forwards in the CHL in terms of generating scoring chances. In terms of the negatives, DeBrincat is very small, coming in at 5-foot-7, but has a real tenacity to his game. He drives the net, battles for pucks and wins some scrums versus much bigger players. His defense isn't great and his size will obviously hold him back there, but there is still a lot to like.",,,,,,,"DeBrincat is a pure sniper in a pint-sized body. He has great speed and a very quick
frst step. He's incredibly hard to slow down once he gets the puck, something that needs to continue
consistently if he is to be successful at the next level. When carrying the puck, DeBrincat exudes confdence, uses his size to slip and weave his way through traffc, and maintains strength on the puck.
He anticipates physical pressure coming his way and will distribute at the right times. Based on the
pressure from defenders, he adjusts his hand speed accordingly, deking his way out of trouble or
protecting the puck at the side of his body. DeBrincat really uses his speed and quickness to his
advantage on the forecheck as he chases down loose pucks or applies pressure to the puck carrier. He is a puck-hungry little bugger who can make the life of a defender hell as he is relentless
in getting the puck back once he loses it. He's not afraid to throw his weight around, or hack
and whack with his stick. And he isn't afraid to take a hit, appearing much more motivated to
make something happen and get on the puck after he receives one. DeBrincat's zone entries
are done with control and speed, oftentimes driving the play so fast that he pushes defenders
back on their heels. When receiving a pass, he has no desire to slow down, more often than
not receiving the pass in transition and increasing his speed right as he gets possession.
DeBrincat has a knack for turning bad passes into strong scoring opportunities, settling the
puck quickly before fring a quick wrist shot or one-timer on net. DeBrincat sees the ice
well and can hit his man with a quick pass on the tape through bodies. He has a pretty
quick release, and although it can be obvious he intends to shoot, his shot is so quick
and accurate it does not matter. He draws defenders in with and without the puck, giving his teammates more space to work with once they get the puck. Defensively, DeBrincat knows his role and gets back to defend rather quickly. He reads the incoming
play well in his zone, and can knock pucks down and move them across ice where
his teammates have more space to work with to break out."
2016,LW,74.5,208.79,40,COL,,Cameron Morrison,"Morrison was his USHL team's leading goal scorer and point producer. Morrison features a pro-level shot and finished on nearly 30 percent of his shots this season. While that obviously is not a shooting percentage that he will maintain, he can absolutely finish chances from a distance. Scouts I've talked to praise his skating, but when I saw him multiple times this season, I never saw a truly high-level gear; it looked more overall average to me, but you see the odd good flash. I'm not a huge believer in his hockey sense, but I still rank him due to his frame, his touch with the puck and his shot; and people I trust around the USHL seem to think there is something there. He is committed to the University of Notre Dame starting next season.",,,,,,,"Morrison is an offensive-minded center who possesses solid size and skill. He likes to go to
the area around the net front and often gets to the top of the crease anticipating pucks headed
his direction. He shows that he has quick hands in tight, fnding pucks quickly and getting them
on the net. Morrison has a good motor and drive to his game, using his powerful skating stride
to try to keep up with the play. He gets the play moving in the right direction and has the skilled
hands to carry the puck through the offensive zone and fnd a good passing lane. Morrison has
a nose for the net, fnds seams and can get a quick shot off in tight. He has a strong ability to
protect the puck and lean against defenders until they tire. There are no easy minutes when
defending him along the wall. Morrison also has an understated offensive mind. He is not fashy
by any means, however, he sees the ice well and fnds teammates in tight spaces. He also has
a knack for winning battles for loose pucks and rebounds. He struggles to create separation
from defenders and is caught from behind due to his slow foot speed. With the emphasis placed
on speed in today's NHL playing to his main weakness, he will have a hard time impacting the
game at the NHL level unless he improves on it. He possesses solid size and offensive skill, but
struggles with the consistency of his game. Morrison has moments of effectiveness and creative
offensive play, and large gaps in play where he is just invisible."
2015,C,72.75,195,1,EDM,,Connor McDavid,"Get used to this name; he could end up as one of the faces of hockey for the next 10 to 20 years. McDavid is one of the best pure skaters I've ever seen. It's incredible how effortlessly he accelerates to an extremely dangerous full speed. At the CHL level, if a defenseman was horizontal to him or even had an inch gap they were beat, plain and simple. He'll step into the NHL next season and be one of his team's fastest players.

His puck skills are also of that same extremely high grade. He makes some of the most unique puck plays you'll see, to where it's hard to describe his puck skills other than to say ""watch him."" His creativity, hand-eye coordination, and balance are simply incredible. McDavid also has elite hockey sense, so on top of his knowing how to make defenders miss left and right and set up his teammates, this also lets him be an elite forechecker when combined with his skating. He follows the play off the puck so well that whenever he's on the ice -- even when the other team has the puck -- you're still expecting a McDavid scoring chance.

He's a relentless worker, and with that quality thrown in with some of his others, it makes him a very dangerous penalty killer as well. McDavid's sole real weakness is his frame right now, as bulking up will be a key for him to survive some of the NHL's physical hurdles.",,,,,,,"The best way to describe this kid in one word is: exceptional. An offensive threat with
tremendous speed, McDavid is lethal in transition and makes opponents step back because of his
ability to burn them quickly. He sees opportunities and pounces on them by using his speed to get to
open ice and create a passing lane for his teammates. Hands of gold make for quick, creative plays
and perfect passes consistently. His hockey IQ and vision are both top notch and he uses them to his
advantage on zone entries as he looks for options while slowing down the pace, showing patience
with the puck before ultimately passing it off or driving hard to the net. He forces the opposition
to make plays off the boards in transition up ice due to his abilities and applies pressure with his
skating and reach, causing opponents to hurry and make mistakes. He has an electric first step
and uses his speed and strength to leave opponents in the dust. McDavid elevates his play
over the course of the game, upping his effect on the game at crucial times. He uses his edges
to explode in every direction and can change speed (up and down) in no time at all, fooling
opponents in the process. While not consistently physical, he isn't afraid to mix it up and has
no issues holding his own at this level. He is a very disciplined player who knows when to
engage in physical play and when to skate away. Finally, the fact that he doesn't use all
of his talent in the offensive zone and saves something for the defensive zone as well is
impressive. He uses his speed to get back and break up plays by stripping players of the
puck. His versatility is something that really stands out, as he is the first one out to kill a
penalty and quarterback the powerplay. He is involved in all facets of the game and will
be an impact player at the NHL level next season. Not a lot to pick from with regards to weaknesses except maybe
that he is still growing into his body and will need to add plenty of strength (core and
lower body) if he hopes to drive his way to the net at the NHL level like he does in
the O. Also, his shot, while accurate, does not jump off his blade like you would
hope for such an impressive offensive talent. He will need to improve the velocity
and release on his shot to fully become that dangerous player we all think he can
be at the next level."
2015,C,74,196,2,BUF,,Jack Eichel,"Eichel is one of the very best college freshmen of the modern era, and had a simply fantastic season. His skill level is elite, and it's off the charts for a 6-2 forward in terms of the amount of high-level plays he makes regularly. Eichel uses a longer than average stick, and with his wingspan and skills he can be almost impossible to get off of the puck. He makes evasions seem effortless to where I often hear from scouts that he looks ""bored"" on the ice because he exerts so little energy when he makes defensemen miss.

He's strong, works hard and thinks the game at such a high level that he creates chances in bunches. His hockey sense allows him to be a top-end playmaker, but he's also a very good defensive forward, who has often been one of his team's top penalty killers. He skates very well with an explosive first few steps and a smooth glide you don't see often with bigger players. He projects as a potential No. 1 star center.",,,,,,,"Eichel is a very strong skater with excellent strength and power in his stride and the
ability to beat anyone he faces. He reaches top-speed quickly and is very agile and elusive. He is balanced on his edges and possesses immense strength on his skates and the ability to control the puck
against pressure. Eichel is not a flashy guy, but instead he beats players with his power, reach and
quickness. He dodges players with smooth moves and he uses his strength to power his way past
players, transporting the puck around the zone with him as he analyzes his playmaking options.
He finds his options quickly and shows off his high hockey IQ and ability to create offense by setting players up with crisp, creative feeds that break down the defense. Eichel also possesses a
powerful shot that he likes to get off from the high-slot. He uses his power and instincts to get
into position and then rifle one off at the net. He has a rising shot and it causes real problems
for goaltenders with the velocity and power behind his release. Eichel's strength and power on
the boards helps him earn possession in battles; winning puck possession and maintaining
control under pressure. He uses his strength well to gain position and get his chances off. He
is hard to knock off the puck, and when he combines his speed, skill and strength, he is very
hard to contain and he becomes the best player on the ice. Eichel doesn't lack effort on defense either, as he plays his normal high-compete game and he gives consistent efforts at
both ends. He plays hard and supports the defense well down-low and in the slot area. He
is an efficient penalty-killer, playing an aggressive style, pressuring the point and causing
changes of possession at the blue line. Again, there is a lot to like about a projected franchise center in the
making, but if there was one area we feel he can improve, it is his game-to-game and
shift-to-shift consistency. There were games this season when it seemed he was just
mailing it in. Mind you most of those came when he had already contributed on the
score sheet and the victory was not in question, but at the NHL level–and if that is
where he wants to play next season–he will not get away with coasting through
the last 20 minutes of play."
2015,C,75,185,3,ARI,,Dylan Strome,"Strome was one of the very top scorers in the OHL this season, and while many point to the teammate effect with McDavid on the same team, he didn't play with him much at even strength, yet still managed a roughly 1.5 points-per-game pace when McDavid was hurt.

""He's a big center with high-end skill. You're never going to find that anywhere but the top of the draft"" said one scout.

Strome is a great stick handler, especially for a 6-3 player, but he's also smart with the puck. He slows the play down very well, operates well in tight spaces and has the offensive instincts to evade pressure at a high level. He's not great defensively yet, although he's fine on the draw and could project to have decent defensive value down the line.

Strome's main weakness is his skating, as he lacks an explosive top gear and is just roughly average in that area overall.",,,,,,,"Strome doesn't have the elite speed that his brother Ryan possesses, but he skates
in a more conservative way. He knows when to increase his speed and when to stay strong and balanced, coasting to keep up with the play and position himself accordingly. He is balanced and fluid in
his movements while also taking a split second to explode from stationary. Moves exceptionally well
with the puck and takes his speed to another level with the puck on his stick. Strome oozes confidence with the puck and can deke out defenders with skilled moves. Changes his hand speed to
fool goalies; stickhandling fast before slowing to a halt on a breakaway before snapping the puck
on net. Not flashy with the puck but is strong on it and makes plays happen. Has the ability to
pull a deke to get past defenders and to open space where he creates his own shooting lanes.
Strome has an innate ability to gain the zone and dish a beautiful pass to teammates as they
drive the net. He loves to thread the needle with passes and making defenders look silly for allowing it to squeeze past them. He opens passing lanes for teammates by getting to open ice
and drawing defender in before making things happen. Strome is willing to battle on the wall
and for pucks but is better suited to be in open ice and not grinding it out along the wall. He
uses his reach to his advantage to poke pucks away from opponents and gets to his check
to cover him in the defensive zone. He is vocal, and active with teammates, pumping them
up, or calming them down, as he sees fit. The big issue people in the industry find with him is his slower feet
but honestly, he is the classic still-developing skater where he is just waiting for his leg
strength to improve and his stride will follow suit. He is not slow by any stretch. Multiple
times this season we found Strome to have a mixed effort in all three zones; some
shifts he was guns-a-blazing in the offensive zone and made no effort in the defensive zone, while other shifts he was giving 110 per cent in the defensive zone and
covering his checks. His effort in the faceoff circle can also be inconsistent; he can
look outmatched in some instances and far superior to his competition the very
next opportunity he is given. Needs to add muscle and improve that consistency
if he is to reach his NHL dream sooner than later."
2015,RW,71,160,4,TML,,Mitch Marner,"Marner had a fantastic 17-year-old season in the OHL, racking up an absurd amount of points. He's a shifty player, and is tough for a defense to stop. His speed, acceleration and edge control are all high-end, and because of that, you rarely saw an OHL defenseman land a clean check on Marner. His puck skills are elite, and he can make great in-tight plays to evade pressure, dekes in full stride to get around a defender or puck plays off the half-boards that create offense in bunches.

Marner is also an incredible passer, making quick reads with the ability to stretch the ice or move it across laterally through traffic with consistency. While small, his defensive game is solid, and improved quite notably over the course of the OHL season to where he became one of London's better penalty killers. He's also quite an effective forechecker, not in terms of physical play, but rather how well he forces plays and is sneaky on takeaways.",,,,,,,"Marner is a quick offensive winger who carries the offensive load for the Knights and
plays upwards of 25 minutes a night. He sees time in all situations; even being positioned on the point
on the powerplay and playing double duty by not only being in London's top six but also centering the
fourth line on many nights. He is explosive; possesses game breaking speed, some phenomenal
lateral agility and moves exceptionally well in all directions with very fluid strides. The kid can burst
through holes and into lanes, accelerating in a flash, which makes him dangerous. Such a cerebral
player who sees the ice well and oozes confidence with the puck. Doesn't stand still on the rush
and he moves the puck and hustles up ice. Has a nifty set of moves, especially at top speed, and
loves to change it up to fool goalies and defenders. Shows patience with the puck looking for
an open target all over the ice. Marner is an elusive playmaker with innate finishing ability who
possesses crazy high speed as he gains the offensive zone. He is very good in control and has
fast hands in his stickhandling as he looks to create some offensive magic. Marner is elusive
and won't rush to make just any play; he calculates his options and shows patience when
in possession. Passes are creative and right onto the tape of his target. He somehow sees
unthinkable passing lanes and executes perfectly. Has a rocket of a shot that he uses to
deceive goaltenders and picks his spots with no trouble. Defensively, he uses this speed
to separate from checks and to catch his man on the back check to break up the play and
turn the puck back up ice. Positions himself well on the penalty kill and jumps on loose
pucks to clear the zone. He will slide over to pick up any missed checks and support on
the sides of the zone, showing strong defensive awareness. The one weakness that stands out above all else and is keeping him from being a top three selection in this draft is his size and lack of overall
strength. He has addressed any and all other concerns this season but this one will
likely keep him out of the NHL next year and maybe even the season after as well.
He got knocked around often this season, but didn't let that stop him–he would
always jump back up. But there is a big difference between a 18/19-year-old OHL
defender and a 28-year-old bone crushing NHL defender. A good summer or
two of eating like a horse and hitting the gym would go a long way."
2015,D,74.75,203,5,CAR,,Noah Hanifan,"Hanifin is an elite all-around defenseman who has a real chance to be in the NHL next season should he choose to leave Boston College. He's a high-end skater who moves incredibly well for a player of his size. His first few steps are explosive, with as much power out of his pivots and crossovers as you'll see in a defenseman, making him very dangerous in transition.

His puck skills and offensive IQ don't blow you away, but he's very good in those areas. Hanifin can make the quick passes, lead a rush in a dynamic way and makes good decisions with the puck.

Defensively, he closes his gaps well, uses his stick effectively and projects as a player who can stop good forwards. Overall, his game is a high-tempo, high-energy style, though he's not the most bruising defender.",,,,,,,"Hanifin is a steady, mobile two-way defenseman who loves the offensive side of the
game. The one thing he showed time and time again this season and last is that he thinks the game
well years beyond his age. He processes it at a very high level and possesses the skills to be able
to do what he wants to do in all zones. He is very confident with the puck on his stick and loves to
rush the puck himself or join in on the rush. In the defensive zone, he uses his big frame and long
stick well. He always leads with his stick to deflect shots/passes off the opposition's sticks. A gifted,
smooth skating defenseman, Hanifin has a good first step and is mobile in all facets of the game.
He ahows his pro-ready vision and puck smarts on every shift. He plays tough in the corners and
in front of the net. He is almost always in the correct position. He has an extremely long reach
and uses it well to break up rushes and take away passing lanes. On the rare occasion that
he makes a mistake, his calmness and poise allows him to get back in position and play like
nothing happened. When his passes do get intercepted or there is a turnover he is quick to
instantly apply pressure to his man and limit him from gaining any meaningful ground. His
poise is also on display when he has the puck. His passing ability is very impressive; always
tape-to-tape, whether the player is in motion or stationary. His shot is also incredibly hard
and accurate; a real weapon on the powerplay. Has the size, speed, skill, and smarts at
both ends of the ice that allows him to have success. Makes strong reads of the developing play and creates opportunity to get the puck going in the proper direction. While not really a weakness, it should be noted that Hanifin does not play a very physical game. He has no problem with using his strength to pin an
attacker along the wall or close someone off when they try to carry the puck past him
but do not look for him to lead the physical game with a big hit or by dropping the
gloves. One other thing is that he can over handle the puck on the rush at times. It
does not cost him in terms of turning over the puck, but it is an unnecessary risky
trait that could be exploited at the NHL level. "
2015,C,75,210,6,NJD,,Pavel Zacha,"Zacha's season was a little up and down, as he lost time due to injuries and performed pretty well, but was somewhat below expectations considering he's been a highly touted prospect for the past few years. All the tools point in the right direction for Zacha. He's a big, strong forward who uses his body well to win battles and deliver hits. He's a fantastic skater for a big man. His technique is very refined, he's good in tight spaces, and can explode through the neutral zone.

He's also a pretty skilled playmaker who shows skilled, coordinated puck handling and the vision to make plays. Zacha's shot is notably above average, with a ton of torque behind it. He'll need to improve his defensive positioning, but he does show effort to come back on D.",,,,,,,"Zacha is the total package. He has pro size, explosive speed and a deadly release.
Zacha is a threat every time that he is on the ice and we love the fact that he finishes his checks hard.
He is always hard on the puck and wins the majority of battles in all three zones. He is a physically
imposing pivot who uses his size and strength to fully control the cycle game down low. Has some
magical hands as he has no problem with pulling the puck from behind with one hand and up to the
front of his body without slowing down at all. Uses his long reach to his advantage pulling pucks
that are out of reach in close where he can quickly pull a skilled move or get off a shot with little
effort. His agility and speed allow him to elude hits and beat defenders wide or down the middle.
Zacha is also very good at changing speeds which makes him deceptive and elusive. The power
in his stride is incredible and allows him to explode in every direction, even at top speed. A very
smart player who gets to the right area of the ice for a pass. He has an excellent shot, with
enormous velocity and an even better release. Zacha's hands and vision are very good as well
and he can penetrate the zone and feed teammates through traffic very effectively. He picks
up his man on the backcheck and does a good job of removing him from the play. He helps
out below the hash marks in the defensive zone and helps to grind it out and get the puck
out of the zone. Does a good job of offering support outside of a crowd and helps out in
all areas. Always seems to be on the right side of the puck and uses his body to push his
way through traffic. Zacha makes unreal passes on the rush when it is least expected. He
leads his man with the puck and gets creative in his passing as he gets fancy and dishes
behind the back pass from the corner to the slot and right on the tape. Zacha was a
very dangerous goal scorer at the recent U18's for his native Czech Republic. The sky
is the limit for this kid and we believe that he will be very successful at the next level. Zacha showed off why he is a top prospect for this year's draft
on many nights for Sarnia, but also seems to be missing or down right coasting on
many shifts. The biggest negative we see from him on a continual basis is his constant willingness to try to do it all on his own and not fully utilizing his teammates
like he could. His physical ability and nasty demeanor is an intriguing characteristic for NHL teams; however, just like some undisciplined NHL players can
cost their teams with bad penalties, Zacha may do the same–that was seen
plenty this season. "
2015,D,72.5,201,7,PHI,,Ivan Provorov,"Provorov is a very skilled and advanced defenseman who has shown a strong commitment to North America, having played on this side of the Atlantic for the past four seasons. He's a very gifted skater with good agility and power out of his stride. Mechanically, he isn't perfect -- he has an awkward lean-over skating style -- but the end result looks promising, with room to improve. He's above average as an offensive player, with good puck skills and great ability to find lanes and move the puck.

He's slightly undersized for a defenseman, but he's decent-to-solid in his own end, with good angles, positioning and stick work. There are times when his defensive zone play shows a read error, but overall, he makes enough stops to be reliable at even strength.",,,,,,,"Provorov is a smooth-skating, highly intelligent blueliner. He has great composure in
all zones and all situations. He never looks panicked. He shows that composure off by taking the puck
in his own zone, methodically escaping the forecheck before wiring a crisp outlet pass onto the tape of
the forward breaking out of the zone. He does this consistently and effortlessly. He really has a lot of
whip in his stick when he passes, and executes outlets in a flawless fashion. He shows off a nice low,
hard, accurate wrist shot from the point on the powerplay or his fantastic slapshot off the one-timer.
He can absolutely wire the puck with a shooting technique that is mature from top to bottom as he
is projected to be a threat at the NHL level as both a PP passer and point shooter. His composure
also comes into play in the offensive zone; either by making a really nice spin move when faced
with pressure or just making the simple dump where a teammate can retrieve it. Likes to carry
the puck through the neutral zone with a heads up style of play, holding off attacking sticks
while still drawing in defenders before making plays. He displays a strong sense of positioning
and decision making regarding when to join the rush. On the defensive side of the puck he
also shows well by displaying elite hockey sense. He reads the play exceptionally well and
knows his coverage assignment. Makes smooth plays to neutralize the attack and smart
reads. He uses his edges and solid footwork to maintain a tight gap as he skates backwards over the red line. He uses his stick to steer the attacker to the boards, making one
quick hop to the left before poking the puck away and guiding the attacking player into
the wall. His plays both offensively and defensively are all done in such a fluid motion
and in such quick succession that he really makes it look easy. Provorov is also very
clever in using his 200-pound frame. He can throw a surprising and punishing check,
and he seems to always engage using his thick body a split second before the opposing checker, gaining inside position on the puck. What do you say about a draft eligible defenseman that brings
back flashes of Doug Harvey and his calm calculated demeanour, skating the
puck up ice before bursting a pass through a seam? Or of how Niklas Lidstrom
used to defend the rush by angling guys off and quickly turning the play back
up ice. The obvious Russian factor that has been mitigated somewhat by his
desire over the past couple seasons to play in North America and the current
Russian economy. But some NHL teams are still apprehensive to spend a
high value asset."
2015,D,74,206,8,CBJ,,Zach Werenski,"Werenski was incredible this season, and was arguably Michigan's best defenseman despite being 17 years old.

""He's smooth as silk"" said one scout; with another saying ""he makes everything look easy.""

His skating won't blow you away, but he's certainly above average, with power out of his first step, good edges and footwork. Werenski is at the top of his game when he has the puck, whether it's on an outlet, bringing it up on the rush or controlling a power play. He makes a ton of plays offensively and never looks panicked when doing so.

He's pretty developed physically already, measuring in at 6-2 and 214 pounds, although he's not a very physical player. His defense isn't poor, in fact I'd say it's better than average, but he can get caught making mistakes in his positional play. He's a potential top-four D-man, who can also be a first-unit power-play option.",,,,,,,"Werenski really impresses as a smooth, puck-moving defenseman who is responsible
defensively and has the raw offensive instincts to quarterback a potent powerplay. Werenski is a strong
skater who moves fluidly with his high-end mobility and agility with and without the puck. His short
passes and long range passes both hit their marks. He makes such smooth passes on the breakout
it almost looks effortless, which makes it all the better as he kick starts the rush. Very strong reads
of the game and his reactions tend to be the most appropriate for the situation he finds himself in.
Confidence radiates from him when he has the puck and it makes his teammates calm and feel
comfortable with him leading the charge, even as the youngest member on the team. Werenski
is a cerebral defender with an impactful first pass that enables the forwards to get a head start
on gaining the zone and creating some offense. He will carry the puck up on his own and gain
the zone, but he dissects all options before deciding. Maintains a good handle on the puck and
poise when pressured and still manages to get a perfect pass off. On the powerplay, Werenski
is very active and is constantly moving to open ice to help give his teammates an open pass.
Makes the smart play with excellent lateral movement to keep the puck in at the point. His
shot packs a punch from the point. It is an absolute cannon and he does a great job getting
it through traffic in front. Plays the one-on-one well and uses his stick to poke the puck off
the opponent's stick before taking a quick step forward to retrieve it and move it back up
ice. His game is mature beyond his years and he has the potential to be an impact player
at the NHL level as soon as next season. A lack of overall consistency is an area that will need to improve.
He puts forward many impactful shifts every game, but he can also go invisible for
long stretches as well. Another area where he sometimes gets himself in trouble is
with his shot hitting shin pads of forwards pressuring him hard at the point. Fortunately, sometimes he reads that and makes the smart play to go d-to-d or gets the
puck deep to avoid that trouble. The area that needs the most work, though, is
his defensive game. He runs around a bit in the defensive zone and the coach
does not trust him enough defensively to give him any real PK time. Essentially,
it comes down to him developing the mindset of having to play consistent defense to realize his full potential. "
2015,RW,73,209,9,SJS,,Timo Meier,"Meier had a pretty successful second season in North America, racking up a lot of points in Halifax. He's a versatile forward in that he can play center and the wing and can play on both special teams. Meier has a pro-sized frame, skates and handles the puck at above-average levels and can play with pace.

His ability to play either a speed, skill or power game makes him very appealing, especially since he shows a commitment to get back into the defensive zone. Scouts have noted that he can get tunnel vision with the puck at times, and overall he's not a true standout offensive talent. But he does a lot well and has a fair amount of NHL potential.",,,,,,,"Meier makes good decisions with and without the puck and plays his position very
well. His line dominated in the offensive zone all season and was leaned on quite a bit in Halifax this
season. We like Meier's strength. He has a very hard, pro-ready shot, a long reach and isn't afraid to
go to the dirty areas. Meier has a hop in his step and has good, quick acceleration that allows him to
scoot past defenders and beat them to pucks. Skating is a tad choppy at full speed but he is well balanced and has above average mobility. Good quick release on his wrist shots, often fooling goalies
due to the speed on the release as he forces them to make a save. He's a high-flying winger who
exudes confidence with the puck, possessing quick hands and the ability to stickhandle in tight
quarters. Passes are so smooth they look to be going in slow motion. Meier sees passing lanes
well and adjusts his positioning to hit them with perfection. Good on zone entries as he looks for
options with speed or slows up to a stop inside the blue line to move the puck. He will grind it
out in the corner to retrieve the puck and seems to always want possession, thriving when he
is in control of the game. Has the instinct to know when his teammate is going to get a shot
off, and reacts by driving to the net to get any possible rebound. Will take a hit to make a play
and uses his strength effectively on the wall. Separates himself from opponents with his
burst and his size, but isn't one to lay a huge hit on the wall or in open ice. Makes the right
decisions in the offensive zone, even when being extremely pressured; does this with
poise and patience as he dishes the puck or protects it until he creates an option or one
presents itself. Absolutely a guy who was trending upwards as the season progressed.  Meier's defensive play is not an area that would be considered a
plus; although, he does know what and when to make a play in his own zone. The
drive to do it is the issue. His conditioning is definitely a question mark as well. He
seemed to wear down at points in the season. We are not convinced he is a highend guy we can see leading a team offensively at the next level, but instead, more
of a strong complimentary player who can keep up to the most skilled and flashy
playmakers or plug into a third line role if needed. There were game reports this
season with the notes “inconsistent compete level” that might make an NHL
team think twice about taking him too early. Not going to be a consistent physical guy or a beast to play against on the wall. His strength and size should only
be seen as a potential asset."
2015,RW,75.5,211,10,COL,,Mikko Rantanen,"Rantanen had as good a second half as any prospect in this year's class, with a great World Juniors, and carried one of the worst teams in the Liiga this season despite being under 19. Rantanen is a big-bodied, 6-foot-4 forward with tremendous skill for a player his size. His hands are above average to high end, with the offensive creativity to make tough plays. Rantanen is a good playmaker who can make some impressive passes and flash top-end ability in that area.

He's not an overly physical player, but on occasion he'll drive the net and make the most of his size; unfortunately, that doesn't happen as much as you'd hope. His skating is roughly average, maybe a tick below out of the gate, although I've heard some Finnish scouts say they're not too concerned there. Rantanen's defense showed improvements this season, but that area could also use some work.",,,,,,,"The big, strong right wing shows really good, smooth and balanced skating, especially
for his size. Rantanen is not lightning quick, but regardless of quickness he is a solid overall skater. His
skating allows him to pick up decent speed and makes him hard to control or contain. Makes good,
crisp passes to the safe option. He is cautious when making a pass in or around his own end, but
plays a little more risky when in possession deep in the offensive zone. He control his pace to line up
with the pass very well, slowing down or speeding up, to ensure that he gains control on the rush.
Will work the puck down low and cycle it when no options are readily available, but can create
space by drawing defenders in and making a pass to the newfound open ice. Protects the puck
extremely well with his body but also has some creative hands he likes to use. Reads the play
exceptionally well in the offensive zone and reacts as he quickly moves to open ice calling for
a pass when his team has possession. Has a good, quick wrist and doesn't need to get set to
unload. Quick to corral the puck and wait for the goalie to make a move before he unloads a
quick release to the open net; it often doesn't even look like Rantanen is getting set to shoot
until the puck is off his stick and in the back of the net. Such a deceptive release point fools
goalies, even when they are fully ready for it. He will be physical at times on the wall and
hold his ground in front of the net. Tenacious on the forecheck and is even better, more
consistent, on the backcheck; shows that he is aware defensively and will always look for
his check on the way back. His defensive game is a strength, he battles for pucks and
pressures defensemen for pucks deep in their own zone. He is often in a good position
without the puck. His willingness to sacrifice his body to block a shot and play defense
will endear him to his teammates. Already has the size, strength and experience to be
an impact player at the NHL level as soon as next season. Not that he is a bad skater at all, but we expect his stride to be even more enhanced when he adds a little more leg strength as he looks a little
top heavy right now in terms of current muscle distribution. He is average in tight
to the opposition's net as he tries to get a little fancy with one too many moves
around the net. Does most of his damage out in the slot or around the circles.
His physical play is also an area of inconsistency as the willingness to engage
in contact is not all there. Instead, he tries to use his long reach to dig for
pucks when he should just be running guys over. Goes through stretches
where he seems to not be able to find a rhythm offensively. "
2015,LW,76,215,11,FLA,,Lawson Crouse,"Crouse is a player with fantastic physical gifts, and despite a lack of amazing statistical production, he's consistently impressive. He's an outstanding skater for a 6-4 forward and will be an above-average skater at the NHL level. Given his large body mass, the way he gets up to his top gear so quickly is a standout attribute of his game.

Crouse plays a tough brand of hockey, supplemented by his filled-out frame, and he projects as an elite physical player in the NHL. Crouse is very advanced defensively for an under-18 prospect, showing very good defensive awareness and penalty-killing skills. He's not a standout offensively, but he's above average in terms of puck skills and offensive ability; he just doesn't show it consistently. I'm not sure if this is due to a lack of offensive IQ, or not yet being comfortable playing that kind of game. But, I've seen him make high-level plays, the points will come.",,,,,,,"Crouse is a big, explosive winger that hits like a truck. He is a smart player, but doesn't
stand out with any flash or dash in regards to puck handling skills. The big bodied player skates well,
with no huge amount of speed, but exceptional stability; once he gets up to speed he is incredibly
difficult to stop or angle off. Crouse does have a powerful stride that gets him moving and generates
solid speed levels for his size. Moves well with the puck, does not slow down at all, and makes it near
impossible for opposing players to knock him off it or strip him. Not the fastest hands around but
strong and does wonders with them: holding off defenders with his free hand or just being heavy on
his stick. Has an impressive ability to drive the net or cycle along the wall, all while seeing passing lanes and making split second decisions with the puck–impressive traits for such a big man.
Smooth hands on the rush as he can pull the puck around a sliding defender and get a swift
backhand pass on the tape of the centerman streaking in. Puts some heat on his passes and
he connects with his target on the tape. Is always moving to create passing options and lanes,
and utilizes his large frame to bull his way through opponents to create his own lanes. Crouse
gets to the right areas to score and has a wicked release on his heavy wrist shot. Crouse has
no fear in engaging physically. He knows when and where to use his body effectively and
plays his man well. Can lay a crushing hit when he sees fit and is not afraid a give a little
cheap shot after the whistle to get the opposition going. He is a beast on the forecheck
and forces defensemen to panic and make mistakes. Nearly impossible to move in front
and doesn't get rattled by anybody as he fights off checks and pushes his way to create
space. Hockey sense is solid and he makes good decisions with and without the puck.
A very good communicator on the ice and knows where to be defensively, sometimes
does a tad too much as he covers his check and that of his linemates. Crouse is a
sure fire future NHLer. The question that no one can answer but is thinking with this
guy is what will his offensive upside be at the NHL level. Will he be the next Cam
Neely? Or top out as a just an effective two-way power winger? At the OHL level
he can go absent for long stretches at a time, not that he is a defensive liability
because he is always involved in that regard, but more along the lines as he
is not trying to generate much offensively. He is more of a complementary
player to a skilled centerman, but has also shown at times the ability to be
the offensive driver."
2015,RW,74.5,183,12,DAL,,Denis Gurianov,"Guryanov had a pretty good season -- scoring around a point per game in the Russian junior league and getting a stint in the KHL, on top of good international performances. He is an explosive skater and gets the highest of grades in terms of pure skating ability for a player his size. He pushes the pace very well and can be a lot to handle for defenders on the rush. He combines that with a pretty impressive skill level, as he creates a lot of chances with his hands and vision.

His decisions with the puck aren't always great, but he does get involved a lot on offense. Guryanov is also a solid finisher, flashing an above-average shot. Guryanov gets pretty involved in the physical play and at times might even push the limits in that regard, in terms of penalty trouble. He's not a defensive stalwart, but he's solid in his own end -- closing on his checks effectively -- and has penalty-killing skills on top of being a shorthanded scoring threat.",,,,,,,"The big Russian winger is a speedy and skilled forward who has potent offensive ability. A very quick skater who can pick up steam in an instant and break plays open. Guryanov is a poised
puck carrier who has a long reach and great hands to remain elusive to checkers. He has no problem
transitioning the puck and moving the play around the offensive zone, even though he tries to tackle
these tasks with a bit of selfishness. When Guryanov does see a passing lane, he will execute. He
can find small windows of opportunity and is confident in hitting a streaking teammate's stick. Guryanov has a good sense of the offensive zone, especially finding open ice. He's not just a flash and
dash player, he goes into corners, throws his body around and drags plays to the front of his net.
He fights through checks to get loose in order to get the puck on net. He has a lethal shot that
he can get off quickly. Shot selection is perfect and all of which have high velocity. Easily has a
pro ready release and displays a powerful snap shot off the one-timer as he steps into the puck
with all of his weight behind it. We like his compete level all over the ice and willingness to
play responsibly. He sees some time on the penalty kill and powerplay. He is good at reading
the play and keeping himself in a good position. Defensively, Guryanov challenges the point
man, takes away space and limits options, all while being a danger to turn the play back
the other way. We like his physical game but he can go overboard at times and get himself
and his team into penalty trouble in the process. Loves to lay the body and looks to drive
the opposition through the boards. Pretty quick on the backcheck to pick up his man, but
would like to see a consistent effort in the defensive zone. Heading up ice without the
puck, Guryanov puts himself in the right position to get a pass. He has a flashy, creative
side with the puck, which is made possible with his quick hands in tight. Has an explosive stride when he needs it; he is a balanced skater who is hard to push around.
Really the full package of size and skill. Another prospect who really had a strong
showing at the U18's this past April. Had a cup of coffee with Lada Togliatti in the
KHL this season and expects to play there full time next season. The birth certificate is his main area of concern. Guryanov
has made no commitment to playing in the NHL and has not expressed his interest, meaning he is a real risk for the NHL team that selects him. If his name
was John Smith from Toronto, he would likely be considered a top 10 pick by
many teams. "
2015,D,72.75,184,13,BOS,,Jakub Zboril,"The Czech native was very good in his rookie Q season after crossing the pond. He played all situations for the Sea Dogs and got better as the season went along. Zboril has a pretty well-rounded style but doesn't have one particular elite skill.

""He's a great skater who carries the puck well,"" one NHL scout said, while another stated, ""He's got a great physical game and can make plays in his own end.""

His footwork is very clean, with an easy stride and the power to get up in the rush. Zboril doesn't have standout puck skills, but he's a very calm and efficient passer who makes plays when under pressure. He uses his frame well to win battles and box out forwards and still has room to fill out. Defensively, he shows solid value. His positioning and reads aren't perfectly tweaked yet, as I've seen him get beat a little too much, but he makes stops and can kill penalties at a fine level.",,,,,,,"Zboril is a silky smooth defender with an elite understanding of where the play is headed. Amazing feet and constantly makes high-end reads on the breakout. He plays a pretty complete
game, but primarily relies on his footwork to get the job done. He has nice speed in open ice and has
the ability to make the other team miss with some fancy footwork and head fakes. His skating is
also key in races to loose pucks and catching forwards. It takes him very few steps to catch up to
opposing forwards or make it to a loose puck first. Cannot be pressured by forecheckers as he can
simply skate himself out of danger with his great feet. He also has an absolute cannon from the
point, and what really makes him dangerous is that he gets it off in no time. He makes the decision
very quickly to shoot the puck or make another play, either way, the puck is not on his stick for
very long. It's pretty accurate and it's as hard as they come. Has great vision and is also a solid
carrier of the puck. Joins the rush pretty often. Defensively, he doesn't like to initiate and uses
his stick more consistently than his body. But when he does use his physical side he is very
dangerous and extremely tough to play against. He is a bit of a sleeping bear as he picks
up the physical game and edge when someone pisses him off in front of the net or after the
whistle. When he plays with that edge opponents need to watch out as he will line them
up and try to take their heads off with a big devastating check. He also does not telegraph
when he is coming, which makes him scary. Not afraid to push, shove, face-wash or even
apply a little slash to an opponents calf in a scrum. His defensive reads are solid and he
knows who to cover. Good on penalty kill, but not great. Plays smart hockey, and learns
from his mistakes. A lack of consistency is the largest negative we can find with him
as he can have a real impact one shift and then look like a total passenger the next
five shifts. He will have a shift where he is hard to play against, making a strong
physical play and transitioning the puck quickly, but then the next he is faced with a
similar situation he looks soft, just waving his stick at them and unwilling to make
the hard physical play. This inconsistency carries over to his passing game as
well as he can be pin point accurate and then suffer bouts of throwing passes a
good five feet in front of his streaking forwards or into their feet."
2015,LW,71.75,174,14,BOS,,Jake Debrusk,"DeBrusk had an excellent age-17 season, showing off his many tools. He's a good skater, generates a dangerous top gear and has solid power in his lower body. His work ethic is strong, and that helps him cover a lot of ice. DeBrusk is a very skilled playmaker who can make the soft-touch plays to his teammates, as well as create chances for himself.

He's a little undersized, but he fights through checks, gets back on defense and is a solid penalty killer. In the WHL this season, he showed he can be an all-situations player while also making an occasional appearance on highlight reels.",,,,,,,"DeBrusk is a heads up player, always aware of surroundings whether with or without
the puck. He receives the puck extremely well and is also very good at getting into position to take a
pass. While crashing the net often, he's not just a pure grinder type. He picks his spots well, times his
plays well and sniffs out open areas of the ice around the crease. Has a good wrist shot with a snap
release that is always a threat to pick a corner on even the most well positioned goalie. Possesses
very strong decision making. He makes quick decisions and rarely makes a bad play regarding his
positioning or play with the puck. He often makes quick little give-and-go passes both in the neutral
zone and offensive zone and that really allow him to drive lanes, open space and create offense.
While not elite, speed is quite solid and his balance is very good. He rarely gets knocked off the
puck or off stride and that balance is huge for him when he hangs out around the blue ice looking for loose pucks. He sees time on the PP and is dangerous on that unit. He primarily plays
down in the right corner, his off-wing, but rotates all over the ice. He also saw time in front of
the net, back on the half-wall on the left-wing as well as even floating back to the point a time
or two to provide support during rotation. Debrusk shows tenacity in puck pursuit, awareness
of his positioning and support of his teammates along the boards. On the offensive side of
the puck is where he really excels. He reads the play extremely well with a very high-end
level of offensive timing. His understanding of positioning and timing is what leads to a
number of his chances and goals. He simply has a goal-scorer's mindset. His offensive
capabilities aren't cutting edge or a notch above the top of the draft class, but he is a
crafty player who is consistently a threat to hurt the opposition. His overall consistency
is something that has also been extremely impressive as the year has gone on. He works hard and had some good back checks, but he's not an
aggressive defender and isn't super adept at covering his guy. His hockey sense
and work ethic should allow for growth in this area. One thing that has improved
is his skating. His speed has improved by a slight notch throughout the year and
once he is at top speed he is a real threat. While his acceleration is still a bit
clunky with slightly heavy feet, even more improvement in that area will take his
game to a new level. He leaves a lot to be desired in his physical game as well.
He seems to be awkward and lack strength; although, an effort to play a gritty
game was becoming more noticeable as the season wore on."
2015,RW,73,192,15,BOS,,Zachary Senyshyn,"Here's another guy who trended up in a significant way this season. He's one of the quickest players in this draft class, with an elite top gear and an ability to push defensemen off their gaps. He's solid defensively, including on the penalty kill. Some believe he plays a little too much of a North-South game, but still makes offensive plays. Senyshyn plays with energy, but his physical game is subpar as of now.",,,,,,,"A high-flying, speedy winger with developing goal scoring potential. Senyshyn is continually
flying all over the ice, having a positive effect and creating time and space with the puck on
his stick. Uses his impressive wheels to beat defenders wide and drive to the net for scoring
opportunities. His efforts on the back check can be a little inconsistent: one play he would be
dragging his feet and the next he would explode back to catch the puck carrier, flying past a
bunch of other players. His speed with the puck is high-end and he is elusive as he maintains
possession and darts past defenders. When he gets the puck, he absolutely explodes down the
wing and commands the attention of defenders. Reads the play at a very high level and is quick
to support the puck carrier or to jump on loose pucks. Puts himself in the best possible scoring
position. The kid will do anything for a goal, even taking an absolute beating in front of the net
while holding his ground exceptionally well. Has some ridiculous hands and array of dekes that
he showed he can pull off at top speed. Uses his solid frame, quickness and agility to spin off
his checks and pull away from the man to open up space. He is a rising star and has been skyrocketing up our draft list all season."
2015,C,71.25,175,16,NYI,,Matthew Barzal,"In prospect circles, Barzal has been a name in discussion for most of this decade as he came up through the Bantam ranks. The former first overall WHL pick is an exciting and well-rounded prospect with significant upside. He's one of the best skaters in this draft class, with an explosive first step, high-end top speed and his edge work that is among the most impressive of his age group.

Barzal's skill level is also pretty good, with his vision and playmaking being standout attributes. He's patient, creative, and shifty with the puck. He succeeds in many different ways, whether it is off the rush with pace, a quick no-look pass from the cycle, or by making a defenseman miss.

He's not an incredibly physical player, but shows great energy and effort on the ice at both ends. He is often one of his team's top scoring-chance creators and penalty killers.",,,,,,,"An elite level playmaking center. Barzal is a very special player and is typically all over
the ice creating plays. Barzal has elite hands, strong playmaking ability and is a very smooth skater.
He resembles Crosby in the way he moves around the ice and is a fantastic skater at this level with
both his quickness and foot speed. His hands are some of the best in the draft class with the quickness to make plays in tight and the soft touch to place the puck out of reach for defenders. Barzal
is extremely confident when he has the puck on his stick and has tremendous vision. He is able to
find seams and passing lanes that most guys would not see. Makes one of the best saucer passes
we've seen in the draft class with its accuracy and smoothness, landing perfectly for teammates.
He gets lower in his stance stick handling around the perimeter of the zone but with his head up
assessing his options and dissecting from outside in the offensive zone. Slick in possession as
he dekes his way around the offensive zone and making defenders look silly in the process.
Barzal is an incredible playmaker whose ability to see and exploit is all-world. Hand speed can
change based on the situation as he looks to get himself in better position with more room to
work. He is patient and poised, showing that he will wait and wait to make a play, regrouping
to better space and open ice if needed. Has a very strong shot that just jumps off his blade
in a blink causing goaltenders some trouble. This kid is very dangerous offensively and
was very impressive at the U18's for Canada. Barzal is a perimeter player. He will venture into the slot but only
if he calculates the risk is less than the probability of him scoring. He also does not
always show up for each and every shift. A soft player. Going invisible for stretches
and not being able to play though physical contact are two areas that will need to be
corrected if he wants to make it to the next level. As a creative playmaker he also
has a tendency to make some questionable plays and force things with his passes.
He is also not the complete two-way player that teams will hope for when selecting
this high, even though he does surprise with a smart defensive play every now
and again, as he needs to improve his effort level coming back into the defensive
zone. Barzal has some maturity issues that will hopefully be corrected with time
as he can be a little over dramatic and sulk when he doesn't get the attention
he feels he deserves. His puck skills, ability to handle it with speed, amazing
vision, and knack for the offensive side of the game make him a top prospect
in the class even with his drawbacks."
2015,LW,73,177,17,WPG,,Kyle Connor,"Connor has had multiple All-Star-caliber seasons in the USHL, and is the top prospect to come out of that league this season. He plays the game with energy and pace, and is a fantastic skater with a little giddy-up in his step. He comes barreling down the wing, and puts pressure on defensemen with his speed. His hockey IQ and his skating allow him to be an effective defensive forward as well.

He's not especially great as a dangler, but he's definitely above average in the puck skills category, with very quick hands. He likes getting to the net, and is the kind of player to get the puck on the sideboards, make a move to make a defender miss, and either drive the puck to the crease or get a shot on goal.",,,,,,,"Connor is an explosive skater who tends to skate fairly upright, though he is shifty
and can change directions on a dime. Has the ability to catch the puck carrier with his long stride and
explosiveness. With speed, he has the ability to control the puck from behind his back and up to the
front of his body all while entering the zone without slowing down one bit. He is a creative player who
can dish the puck with ease and can stickhandle in and out of trouble. Hands of gold and oozes skill
with the puck. Can make some jaw dropping dekes and does so with a smoothness. Zone entries
and exits are done with full control and impressive amounts of speed. The kid never stops moving, always active, trying to provide a better option or getting to the areas where he needs to get
his nose dirty. Buzzes all around the net in hopes of getting an offensive chance. He possesses
incredible vision, seeing lanes develop and exploiting defensive mishaps from the half wall. He
offers support to the puck carrier on the wall down low in hopes of being in a better position
to create offense. Trails the opposing puck carrier in perfect shadowing position in order to
apply backpressure or lift the stick and pick off the puck, quickly turning it back up ice. He
possesses a deceptive wrist shot with good velocity that forces the goalie to make a save:
one lateral step and a slight flick of the wrist while no one around him had the slightest idea
that he was attempting to shoot until it left his stick. Has a quick release and makes his
own lanes to feed passes or get shots through. Elite ability to create offense and make
beautiful passes through lanes that looks near impossible to get through. Connor is very
good in tight space with the puck and pulls off different moves to get around defenders.
Not a physical guy but will take a hit to make a play, and doesn't let getting crushed into
the wall stop him from making a play first to a teammate. Connor is a very intriguing prospect in the sense that he has all
the tools to be a success at the next level. Some time in college adding muscle
mass and increasing his overall strength and frame will go a long way for him. Like
is the case with most creative players, he gets a little too fancy at times, which
can be a negative when he makes an extra move at the blue line or tries to force
pucks into areas where his teammates are not able to control it. Goes through
stretches where he is inconsistent in his effort levels."
2015,D,73.5,180,18,OTT,,Thomas Chabot,"Chabot had a very quality second campaign in the Q, especially when Saint John's defensive depth was tested and he was asked to step into a bigger role. He's a very gifted skater who can outlet the puck well and is very dangerous off the rush. Chabot has impressive overall hockey IQ, especially offensively, as he sees the ice very well and is able to control the tempo.

His value is certainly offensively tilted, as he loves to join the attack and stretch the ice with his passes. But, he's not entirely one-dimensional, as he can make some defensive stops, is physical and can be effective on the penalty kill. He'll need to continue to develop his defensive play, but he could be a two-way defenseman as a pro.",,,,,,,"Chabot is a smooth skating defenseman who sees the ice well and distributes the
puck with ease. Has a smooth but very powerful stride. His stride generates healthy amounts of speed
and good lateral agility. He is ultra-creative in his passing game and displays a confidence in moving
the puck and unloading shots when lanes become available. Has a heavy shot from the point. On
the powerplay he will drive down deep into the offensive zone to keep offensive pressure and also
slide down deep into the slot from the point to create another shooting option for his linemates. On
the breakout he reads the ice in front of him very well as he scopes out his options and hits his
man with perfect, well-timed passes. Chabot controls the puck with good patience and poise. He
has a real knack offensively and has the confidence and skills to carry the puck end-to-end and
make high risk passes out of the zone or in transition. Defensively, he plays the gap well as he
forces the attacker to make the first move; he follows up by playing the man hard into the wall
or utilizes his exceptional stick use and positioning to break up the attack on the outside of the
ice. Hard to get around one-on-one with great backward skating and long reach. Good positioning defensively in his zone. Impressed some NHL teams with his ability to make creative
breakout passes and strong vision at the U18's in April. A guy who is still developing and
could really become a homerun pick after a few seasons of further growth. This guy can be a little dangerous when he is moving the puck or
making a risky pass as he often does so without much regard for what a turnover might
cause in that situation. Has questionable decision making but does not play dumb so
we feel he will develop in knowing what each situation calls for. Although his high risk
plays usually pay off, he can be sloppy at times. A couple of times during a game,
Chabot is caught either running around in his own end or in too deep in the offensive
zone. He will need to refine his decision making when to pinch or rush the puck and
when to hang back. Chabot's skill and potential size will have NHL team's salivating, but he will need to bear down defensively and round out his game in order
to be successful at the next level, which we believe will come with physical and
mental maturity. His game is soft, lacking a consistent physical element."
2015,LW,73.75,199,19,DET,,Evegeny Svechnikov,"Svechnikov has been a top prospect in the Russian program for a number of years, and had an impressive first season in North America. He's a 6-2 forward with a ton of talent who effectively switched to center in the latter months of the season. He's very shifty in tight, and can make lightning-quick moves to evade pressure. Svechnikov also uses his big frame well to protect the puck and doesn't shy away from putting physical pressure on his opponents. He sees the ice well, and has good touch on all his passes.

His skating isn't a standout attribute, but he skates at a solid to average level, which makes him stand out as a bigger player. His defense is a notable ""work in progress,"" and he doesn't at all seem like a player you're projecting into tough defensive roles as an NHLer. His upside is top-end, as you don't often see his combination of size, puck skills and offensive IQ.",,,,,,,"Svechnikov is a talented power forward with an attractive blend of size and skill. He
has great puck control, which allows him to use his reach to protect the puck while still making plays
in motion. Svechnikov is an excellent skater with a long and efficient stride. He edges very nicely and
his weight transfer is textbook. All this allows him to change directions very rapidly and he can juke
defenders out of position with ease. Great balance and strong on his feet; hard to knock off the
puck and hard to poke check. He is extremely athletic. Shows high-end, top-notch puck protection
skills; able to drive into the zone and slow down the play to look for openings or to play along the
boards and keep the cycle moving. Great feel for the puck and able to make quick and effective
plays in a split second. He is a silky stick handler and shows remarkable control of the puck
away from his body. Svechnikov has solid offensive awareness and good instincts around the
net. He possesses a heavy shot with very little windup and he is skilled at getting himself open
for the one-timer. Not afraid to get into the dirty areas and battle. While a power forward, he
is a new age one like a Rick Nash and prefers to use his size and reach to create a distance
between the puck and opponents as opposed to punishing players physically or intimidating
his opponent. Relies more on a skill/protection style of play. Defensively, he is solid, but not
overly effective as he is always looking to jump at the first sign of an offensive rush. He isn't
a liability, though. When he gets going he is tough to stop and his ability to beat you with
force or skill is impressive. He seems destined for a top line role at the NHL level and has
the potential to be a dominant and dynamic star. Defensively, he tries to come back and stay within arm's reach of
his man but his presence is not exactly felt in his own zone. He seems to like taking
longer than optimal shifts, some of which have hit 2 minutes in length at times this
past season and he has got caught on the ice being too tired to make a defensive
play. That type of individual play will not fly at an NHL training camp and might
be the reason he gets sent back to junior. The guy has the skills to be a top 10
talent, but being Russian, there is that scare factor of competing foreign leagues
poaching him in his prime and after millions of dollars have been invested in his
development. No NHL teams want to deal with agents who have real leverage.
But skill-wise, Svechnikov is up there with the best."
2015,C,73.75,180,20,MIN,,Joel Eriksson Ek,"Eriksson played a good chunk of this season in the SHL, and also played very well in the top Swedish junior circuit. He's a very versatile player and is a low-risk type of prospect. Eriksson's hockey IQ is his best trait.

""He's so smart, always in the right place and never makes a mistake with the puck,"" said one scout.

I wouldn't classify him as a dominant player, but whether he's playing in front of the net on the power play, creating from the side boards, killing off penalties, checking good players, taking a key draw, or being the extra man when the team needs a goal, coaches always can rely on Eriksson. His puck skills are solid, and his skating is about average, with his straight-line speed being stronger than his edges and bursts.",,,,,,,"Eriksson is yet another strong 200-foot player out of the Swedish system. He skates
extremely well and has a competitive streak that keeps him always hunting to make an impact. Very
skilled offensively and likes to drive the play to the net. Has some flashy puck handling skills he can
bust out if necessary to turn opponents inside out. Has a long reach and can change the angle on
an opponent in order to sneak around him. Sees the ice very well and gets to prime real estate to
receive pucks or make a big play. Not fearful to play the grinding, heavy game in high traffic to stir
it up. Has a potent shot that he can snipe some pretty goals with. He has a great shot release that
is quick and deceptive. Drives the net for rebounds and second chances. There is no quit in his
game as he battles until the very end. Uses his powerful skating stride to bull his way around
the ice and into greasy areas of the ice. Tremendous work ethic. He used his speed and size to
charge back on the back check and then add a hand with the breakout, being both a reliable
and responsible player. Supported in all three zones and in all corners of the ice, no matter the
situation. Can crush, and devastate with his checks when he wants to. Drops down low in the
defensive zone to help out and finish checks, not allowing his opponents any room to make a
play. Shows excellent puck protection using his large frame and strength to fight off checks
while being strong on the puck. Completes pinpoint passes that lead his man on the rush.
He keeps the puck close and exudes confidence as he moves through the neutral zone.
Remains anchored in the zone until the coast is clear. Angles his guys into no-man's
land and physically impedes them in order to get possession. Has a good reactive stick
that he keeps in the kitchen of opposing players. Sees plays develop and gets in lanes
to anticipate movement. Was the top Swede at the April U18's in Switzerland. He is
versatile player who can fill in different roles and will see his name on the back of an
NHL jersey very soon. The one area he needs to continue to focus on the most is
adding some muscle to his lower body. Added strength will make him even harder
to play against and nearly impossible to move in front of the opposition's net. He
also needs to work on smoothing out his stride as it can be a little choppy and
we still want to see him finish his checks harder. The one thing NHL teams
need to realize is that he might not develop into that top line offensive threat."
2015,C,72,183,21,OTT,,Colin White,"After coming in to his draft season as a top-15 prospect, White's season didn't unfold quite as well as he'd have liked because of several ailments, but he still managed to pull off a fine campaign. White's standout attribute is his hockey sense.

""He has so many little details to his game"" said one scout, ""he makes smart plays all over the ice.""

White is a smooth, quiet player that gets a lot done. He sees the ice at a high level, he's creative, but isn't overly flashy with the puck, and rarely makes mistakes. White is very good defensively, often being the kind of player who is leaned on to kill penalties and take critical defensive zone draws. His skating is what one scout describes as ""deceptively quick,"" in that he won't jet down the wing, but he can get to a good top gear and doesn't labor around the ice.",,,,,,,"The Boston College commit is a strong two-way player who does many of the little
things a team needs to be a winner. He is a strong and talented center who relishes playing a 200-foot
game. White is a dynamic skater who is strong laterally and can start and stop on a dime. His powerful
first steps give him the ability to gain an advantage on his opponents in foot races. He uses his incredible straight line speed to blow by defenders on the outside and push the pace, opening up lanes
with the puck on his stick by drawing defensemen in close. A smooth operator in the offensive zone
and with the puck on his stick. He surveys the ice for options before dialing up a skilled pass to a
streaking teammate. Quick, smart and smooth is his game. Loves to pass the puck and help set
up solid attempts, but will not turn down an opportunity to fire off a shot himself. Has a strong shot
with quick release, but it is his instincts of where to get to that make him a dangerous scorer.
White doesn't flash with a bevy of creative tricks when he has the puck; he simply holds it, protecting it and keeping it until he finds an option. A very patient player who is an opportunistic
offensive threat. Has a nose for the net and is great at timing arriving pucks and getting off a
quickly released one-timer. White plays all situations. Uses an active mind and well developed defensive tools to get a jump to disrupt the play and cause a turnover. He is relied on
in key situations and important face-offs, winning most of his draws. He gets down low in
the face-off circle, getting his stick parallel to the ice and using his quick reaction time and
strength to win the draw cleanly. White does the little things right. He is strong on the wall
and fights for the puck hard. He is a safe bet to support his defense and dig in along the
boards consistently or if he thinks his teammate has the upper hand he will support just
outside of the scrum, awaiting the loose puck. Has leadership qualities oozing out of
him and was the captain of the NTDP U18's this past season. There is not a lot to pick apart with regards to White's game but
one thing NHL teams will likely be thinking is that his upside and offensive ability
is not that high. He is also not overly large even though he has demonstrated he
is strong for his size. He also has a bit of an injury/illness history the past two
seasons that leave a few question marks as to if he will be able to fully withstand
the rigors of the NHL life. Some further development time in college will do
wonders for him."
2015,G,75,200,22,WSH,,Ilya Samsonov,,,,,,,,"Samsonov is one of the best Russian puck stoppers to come along since Tampa Bay prospect Andrei Vasilevsky was on the draft-eligible scene. He has good natural size; thick and
strong build, not skinny, imposing in the crease for shooters. He moves well, fluidly getting
around the crease. The big Russian stopper is always square to the shot, in strong position and
makes good use of his chest protector. He plays an assertive game with an established presence at the top of his crease. Not terribly athletic, but does end up making some nice saves that
show off his ability to get creative when the defense around him breaks down. He can stack the
pads, use the poke check or rob a shooter with a quick glove save. He can also get his blocker
on a wired puck and deposit it into the protective net or open corner. His rebound control is solid
as well. He challenges shooters and is aggressive, taking away a lot of the net. But he is not so
overly aggressive that it costs him. His reflexes and flexibility are admirable. He makes unconventional efforts to keep competing on plays. His calming nature and confidence are very notable and he bounces back from any goals allowed, showing a quick ability to forget and move on."
2015,RW,72.5,190,23,VAN,,Brock Boeser,"Boeser had a very good first full USHL season and was one of the league's leading goal-scorers as an under-18 player. He's a good physical player, with a bulky 6-foot-1 frame and a great work ethic. Boeser is strong on the puck in battles to help maintain possession, and he goes to the net with consistency. He has one of the better shots in this draft class and gets it off quickly with zip.

While he's skilled, he's not an overly flashy player; he's more of a read-and-react player, who also has solid hand-eye coordination. His skating is about average and leans to being a little below that mark; it's not a huge liability, but he could gain an extra step. His defense also could use some work.",,,,,,,"The University of North Dakota recruit for next season proved to be a goal scorer of
the natural variety. He has great instincts that get him to where the puck will be, in good time and opening himself up to get off a strong shot. He is strong with the puck in possession and protects it with his
strength and long reach. His one-timer shot is off his stick in an instant and behind the goalie often
before they realize he has become a scoring threat. Boeser is not the fastest skater around but he
uses what speed he has to forecheck hard and forces defenders to make mistakes. Very strong on
the puck and has a deadly quick release after he scopes out the exact spot he wants to hit. Likes
to take a quick snap shot on the rush from the top of the circles just off the ice which forces the
goalie to make a kick save creating rebounds. Fully engages physically on the wall. Boeser is
hard and fast in puck pursuit, forcing the opposition to panic and make bad decisions with the
puck. Once in possession, Boeser makes it hard to separate him from the puck as he protects
it with his strength and uses his creative hands to make some magic and keep the puck on a
string. Possesses such smooth hands once he has the puck under control, looking poised
and confident with every handle. Confident with the puck; dishes some perfectly executed
passes as he sees lanes develop and exploits open space by delivering smooth, easy to
control passes. Adapts well to the play around him as he sees the puck coming to the net
and decided to explode into the slot for a chance to bury the rebound. His hands are really strong and he makes great dekes. His area is in front of the net and he is the king of
the crease–playing that role perfectly. Shows strength in the face-off circle and uses his
physical maturity to find success in using his body to separate the man from the puck
while also finishing his checks. Has some issues with his skating at times as he looks like he
should be moving faster, really churning his feet but not producing much in the way
of speed. He will also need to be coached up in the finer points of defensive zone
coverage as he often looks confused. Gets a little focused on the puck in the defensive zone rather than marking his man and is often not fully engaged. A little
sluggish in his feet but he is very mobile and effective with the puck on his stick.
Could clean up his decisions with puck and make sure that he is making the
right decision to put himself and his team in a better position both offensively
and defensively. Will need to improve on his consistency of work."
2015,C,69.75,175,24,PHI,,Travis Konecny,"Konecny's season started a little slow, but his offense picked up as the campaign went along, and the former No. 1 pick in the OHL draft remains a top-end prospect. He's an explosive skater who jets through the neutral zone with the best in the CHL. He darts well in small spaces, and he can turn defensemen's hips with his straight-line speed.

Konecny is small and doesn't win a ton of battles, but he is tough, and he plays a fearless style of hockey where he drives the net and gets involved physically. He's a very skilled puck handler, who can make defenders miss. He's also a very smart offensive player who is more than just a pure dangler. He sees the ice very well and makes a lot of great reads. He also has fine defensive value, and could project onto a pro-level penalty kill if he handles the physical grind.",,,,,,,"Konecny is a hardworking, skilled forward who constantly strives to make something
happen on the ice. His feet are always churning and he generates very strong levels of speed and explosiveness from his feet. His lateral mobility, first step burst and edge work are all at the NHL level.
Has the ability to gain near unstoppable speed in transition. It is reminiscent of Ovechkin as he circles
into his zone and absolutely explodes up the wing with and without the puck. Konecny shows off
his high-end offensive ability as he goes to the soft spots around the net and looks for passes so
he can wire home a quick one-timer or quick release wrist shot. He displays a sweet set of hands
to completely undress defenders or a goaltender and the confidence to be creative in tight. Has
high-end vision and hockey sense to make the right decisions and pick apart lanes on the rush.
Konecny has the ability to make plays at such a fast pace, with no need to slow down, as he
fools opponents when they least expect it. Uses every edge of his skates as he drives up ice
and cuts to different areas; is a high-flying offensive player who creates offense off the rush
and deep in the zone. What he lacks in size, he makes up for in smart play, determination and
dangerous speed. He carries speed with him up ice and can change pace in no time, often
kicking it up a notch within a stride or two. Konecny seems to always make a perfect pass–
his decision-making and execution are done like a pro. Opens himself for a pass and gets
into all kinds of lanes to give a variety of options. Relentless forechecker who cuts passing lanes to create turnovers right onto his stick. He strongly desires to make an impact
physically and will recklessly throw his entire body at the opposition regardless of their
size. While not very big he can deliver a monstrous check on the opposition that turns
the momentum. Everything he does is with an eye on making an impact. Not afraid to
stand up for himself and teammates after whistles. He is a true captain and the undisputed leader of any team he plays on as well as his current club, the Ottawa 67's. The one main area of concern for any NHL team looking at
Konecny will be his size and, more importantly, how that size plays out to his durability. Tends to over handle the puck, and he makes that one extra move at the
offensive blue line that often does more bad than good, as it often gets poked
off his stick."
2015,C,72.5,182,25,WPG,,Jack Roslovic,"The Columbus, Ohio, native impressed me every time I saw the USNTDP play, and was productive all season. He's a very good skater, and though he isn't as high-end with his puck skills, that area is still pretty good. He's also a smart two-way player. Roslovic sees the ice well, with the ability to make the difficult distributions. He also has some dazzle to his game, and will on occasion execute a rush that draws the attention of the crowd. He could stand to bulk up, as he's not all that intimidating in the physical game. Consistency of effort is also a flaw in the view of some scouts.",,,,,,,"Roslovic's hockey sense is off the charts. He is able to make the right, safe plays quickly.
While he isn't a flashy creative type, he is able to find open teammates and get the play moving,
no matter the pressure he faces from opposition. Fast feet help Roslovic accelerate quickly and
build up a head of steam as he drives down the ice with an eye on the net. He seems to slow
a bit in turns, but is nonetheless an agile player who can act like a bar of wet soap in defensive
coverage. He isn't big, but is not afraid to use his body to finish his checks and to battle for the
puck. A relatively safe and smart player, he showed flashes of very good stick skills and is an
offensive weapon off the rush with his vision, creativity and playmaking skills. He has a very
deceptive shot: extremely quick and heavy relative to his size. He has been relied on as the
team's top defensive center playing against the U18's squad's top opposition. Creates havoc
in the defensive zone by getting on opposing puck carriers quickly and blocking their lanes.
Employs an active stick and good mobility in his position to limits options. We think he has the
upside to become an excellent secondary scoring player at the NHL level who can also be sent
out to shut down the opposition's top unit on a nightly basis."
2015,D,73.5,174,26,MON,,Noah Juulsen,"Juulsen was one of the top CHL defenseman scorers this season, and he rose up my board as the campaign went along. He has above-average mobility and puck-moving skills, which is why he was a mainstay for Everett all season on the power play. Juulsen plays a good physical game, which should get better as he puts on more bulk. However, he can be overly aggressive at times, and leave his ideal defensive position. Overall, his defensive-zone play is about average, and he projects more as an offensively tilted player.",,,,,,,"A workhorse, minute munching, puck-rushing type of rearguard. He is a decent straight line
skater who has a smooth stride. Although his speed in forward and reverse isn't elite, he loves
to rush the puck and does so effectively. His quick feet serve well for lateral movement and his
mobility. His edge work is very good and he is strong on his skates. Very smart and decisive
offensive player who sees the ice well, picking his spots to make creative plays. He isn't huge,
but he is very tough and aggressive. Hits to make a difference. You can tell he will have the
potential to be an absolutely devastating hitter once he adds another few pounds to his frame.
Along with that physical play away from the puck, he shows solid gap control and good reads
against the rush. He is strong in his stick positioning, taking away passing lanes and interrupting shots when necessary. He is solid defensively, and displays the ability to force players wide
and take them off the puck in the corners and on the boards. He is an efficient penalty killer
and shows a willingness to get in shooting lanes and take away options. His most outstanding
feature, though, is his ability to handle the puck with great hand-speed and decent strength with
it. He makes consistently good outlet feeds and shows impressive vision."
2015,D,74,191,27,ANA,,Jacob Larsson,"Larsson is a very interesting prospect who played at the top level at times for Frolunda this season, and was a top-four defenseman in Sweden's under-18 lineup. He's got a lot of physical tools, moves effortlessly in all directions and evades pressure pretty well for a big guy. He's not an overly gifted puck mover, but has solid to above-average skill. Defensively, Larsson can make some stops. He uses his body well to win battles and shows good effort in battles. He's not great in his own end, as he could clean up his reads, reactions and overall positioning. His skating allows him to make up for some errors.",,,,,,,"Larsson is a smart player who sees the ice well; he is cognizant of his surroundings
and dishes some strong passes on the tape. Has a graceful skating style with beautifully executed
transition and adequate speed. Good mobility and decent lateral movements to go with his exceptional
balance go a long way. Very agile and has an ability to shake opponents when playing the puck in
his own zone, finding routes and escaping checks. He has a strong first pass and hits his mark more
often than not. Makes some hard passes to spark the breakout, even doing so with a fore checker
pressing. He does a great job of seeing his targets on the breakout and is patient with the puck.
Moves well along the o-line and will jump into the play if necessary to keep play in the zone. Isn't
afraid to step up in the offensive zone to get pucks to the net. Able to get pucks through to the net
with accurate wrist or quick slap shot. Larsson has a bit of an edge defensively and competes
to assert his position on the ice. Has good awareness in the defensive zone, creatively moving
pucks along in the zone and avoiding turnovers deep. Sound positioning and an active stick
with good hand/eye coordination make him tough to beat. He follows plays to eliminate second chances and smothers opponents. Played the penalty kill and powerplay well. On the
PP point he gets pucks through traffic with his quick wrist shot that he can let loose just off
the ice and on net. From point, Larsson likes to shoot low in hopes of creating a rebound.
Works the puck around the offensive zone very well and sets his man up with a pass
before repositioning himself for a one-timer on the potential pass back. In one-on-one
defensive situations, Larsson likes to use his physical play, using his body to make the
opponent lose control of the puck or disrupt their lanes. Larsson shows great hockey
sense by recognizing each situation and making the simple, most effective play. He
talks on the ice as well as pointing for open passes, communicating regularly. Not a real flashy offensive guy and not a big physical defender
either. More of a tweener who can do a bit of both but needs to refine certain areas
of his game as he does nothing yet at an elite level. While he is a smooth skater,
a little more strength in his legs and jump in his first step would go a long way.
Has some consistency issues that need to be hammered out as he can have a
strong shift and then follow it up with a couple an ineffective shifts but we would
not go as far as calling him wildly inconsistent. He needs to make himself
more of a factor in the game on a regular basis as the raw tools are all there."
2015,LW,70.25,173,28,NYI,,Anthony Beauvillier,"A former top pick in the QMJHL draft, Shawnigan had a very good second season in the league, finishing among the top under-18 scorers in all of the CHL. Beauvillier's main weakness is his size, as he measured in at 5-10, but other than that, he's a pretty well-rounded prospect. He's a decent defensive center who is good on draws and displays a high-end work ethic at both ends of the rink. Beauvillier plays with energy, drives the net and engages physically.

He's an above-average skater, who can gain the zone effectively by pushing the defenders back on their gaps. He's not an overly flashy player -- and I've never seen him dominate a game -- but he's always making plays. He's certainly got puck skills, but his best trait is his hockey IQ. He sees the play unfolding very well and sets up chances with his patience and vision. He also has a pretty good shot.",,,,,,,"Beauvillier is that small and pesky type of offensively oriented player who is always in close
proximity to the puck when on the ice. Works hard and shows a good compete level; does many
of the little things right in addition to creating offense and playing a tight defensive game. Always
looking to make an impact regardless of what zone he is in, whether it is blocking shots or driving the net looking for garbage to bang in. He is a speedy guy, is very shifty and moves around
the ice with a nice, quick stride. Showed some good jam on the forecheck and while not being
very physically imposing, he helps his cause by taking good routes to the puck and using his
smarts and savvy board play to win battles. While he illustrated good hand-skills, great vision
and passing skill, and a hard, accurate wrist-shot, his decision-making and effectiveness isn't
always great when he has the puck due to his size and inability to work through that deficit. If he
can add more strength and play smarter, understanding his limitations, we like his upside. Just
a really useful player who we hope will put up solid numbers wherever he plays moving forward."
2015,D,76,183,29,CBJ,,Gabriel Carlsson,"With Carlsson, it's more about the scouting projection as opposed to the statistical production, because there wasn't much of the latter. To put it simply: He's great defensively. He is always coming over the boards for any tough defensive zone draw, and to start most penalty kills. He's very smart in his own end, closing on his checks well, getting in lanes and disrupting offensive setups. His puck skills are not the greatest, but he can jump up into the play here and there.",,,,,,,"A smooth puck-moving defenseman who has an impressive frame to build upon, skates well
and provides a strong defensive presence. Carlsson is really a great skater for his size, with no
real knocks against him. Moves well laterally and can adjust his speed to control gaps effectively. He is great at transitioning the puck up ice and has a knack for injecting himself as a key part
of the attack. Carlsson spots openings well and picks his spots smartly. Carries the puck well
but has a tendency to over handle the play at times, resulting in some turnovers. Passes well
coming out of the defensive zone and works the ice at a high level, generating offensive chances for teammates who get themselves open. Not hesitant with the puck, but has a high threshold
for withstanding pressure. Has a decent shot and can hammer shots through to the net. His
defensive game is effective as he is agile and quick to shut down chances. He is capable of
roughing it up in battles and has the strength and battle skills to come out the victor in physical
battles. Boxes out the front of his net and is quick to bat away chances with his stick. Needs a
bit of simplicity to avoid some blunders, but that may also come with maturity. Needs to work on
some things but, but his head is in the right place to help him be successful. The combination of
his size and skill in both ends will be intriguing for NHL teams, but he will need time."
2015,RW,70.5,191,30,ARI,,Nick Merkley,"Merkley had a very impressive season as one of the WHL's top scorers. He's a high-end offensive weapon who can make a wide variety of plays to generate scoring chances, and is a dynamic puck handler with very soft hands and a high level of creativity. Merkley makes plays in tight spaces and at a very quick pace. He's a very flashy player -- arguably at times trying to be too fancy -- but overall the tempo at which he plays makes him very dangerous.

In games I've seen, he's looked like just an above-average skater, but several scouts I talk to describe him as great in that area. His 5-foot-11 frame isn't ideal, but he works hard in puck battles, has a fine strength level and seems to have the character components to overcome his size. His defensive play has also shown immense improvements from 12 months ago.",,,,,,,"Merkley is consistent all game in his work ethic and shows he has an excellent sense
for creating offense. Very confident with the puck, loves to have possession and hold the puck far away
from his body and cradling it away from oncoming checkers with poise and deliberation. His motor is
his best asset, he never stops moving his feet on the ice and is constantly competing for ice in the
dirty areas. Physically, he can throw a big check, but also shows he can use his strength to cycle
and protect the puck in close quarters. Not afraid to go to the front of the net and look for garbage.
He has great vision and overall hockey sense. He is ultra-creative with elite level vision displayed
when finding open teammates and picks his moments carefully when tryinng to make an individual attempt at generating offense. He looks engaged every shift and he does something noticeable every time he steps on the ice. Always looking to contribute on the ice whether it is making
an offensive play, hustling to make a defensive play or not backing down from a physical battle.
Doesn't show a ton of respect for bigger guys out there, he just buzzes around and gets in
others' grills. Has no trouble circling the offensive zone and feathering passes around when
an open lane presents itself. Good footwork generating forward momentum from a standstill,
seems to have very powerful strides and gets up to a high speed quickly. Possesses a hard
shot, confident in just throwing the puck on net and can beat goalies from considerable
distance. Plays with a high amount of energy and drive. The type of player that every team
wants: hustle, heart and skill. Despite his ability to work through it, his size is a bit of a factor in
why he is not rated as high as he could be. His skating also needs some fine tuning
before he will be able to play at the next level. Best way we can describe his skating
is it looks like he's slipping on the ice, like he's not digging in with his edges as much
as he could. Defensively, the kid will work and help out when he can but has a ways
to go before he can be considered a complete two-way forward. Nitpicking his
defense or skating shouldn't allow for him to slide more than to the middle of the
first, but both are raw parts of his game and he could benefit from improving. His
work ethic will determine if he improves in all areas and this kid loves to work. "
2015,D,72,188,31,SJS,,Jeremy Roy,"Roy has been a top prospect for years, and has consistently displayed his very impressive offensive upside. He's also the rare right-handed defenseman who plays the left side with higher frequency. He's a very good skater in all directions, with nice edge work and a quality top gear. His puck skills are clearly above average, and he's a coordinated puck handler who can lead a rush with ease.

His puck movement is high-end, as he thinks quickly, is creative and doesn't force plays. Roy is slightly undersized and could tighten his gaps defensively at times, but he makes some defensive stops and battles well.",,,,,,,"Roy is a pretty pure offensive defenseman. He shows great poise and composure
when opposing forwards forecheck. He is effective, shows great vision and passing skills when he
makes a great outlet pass to begin the breakout. His strength is certainly in his passing. He passes
tape-to-tape and hits teammates in stride. He likes to rush the puck and does it pretty effectively, but
he does struggle a little at top speeds through the neutral zone. He seemed to fumble it a bit at his
top speed. He reads the situation well, knowing when to push it more or slow it down to wait for his
teammates to join in. He is pretty aggressive with his pinches, and creates loads of offensive opportunity when he makes that gamble. His shot is extremely heavy from the point, but it is typically
all power and very little precision, missing the net often. He makes skilled passes and has great
vision, as well as the ability to become a great PP QB. He sees the ice, anticipates options and
reads the play in front of him very well. Very good at walking the blue line in the offensive zone.
His game revolves around his great offensive skillset and creativity. He is very agile in his
skating and very elusive when carrying the puck. His lateral quickness is the big reason why
so many opponents miss him when trying to attack the puck. His top speed would benefit
from another gear, but he moves well when in possession of the puck. Not overly physical
but he will battle hard on the boards. Defensively he will get his job done one-on-one with
good sticks checks. But in the defensive zone he can be caught running around and being
out of position at times. He is not a huge liability defensively, but he does leave a little to
be desired back there with regards to his decision-making. The biggest thing is his
inability to play a two-on-one correctly. He often gets caught in the middle of playing
the pass or going for the puck carrier, showing indecisiveness. That usually results
in a good scoring chance for the opposition. He also has a weird habit of skating
forwards, towards the net in order to attempt to defend the rush (not that his backwards skating is poor, or his pivots for that matter). Another poor tendency he
showed in the defensive zone was trying to do too much skating with the puck
through the zone when being pressured instead of just getting it out. Plays with
a high amount of risk to his game and has you on the edge of your seat when
defending–not always in a good way. He has the smarts and drive to improve
so hopefully he can iron out some of his wrinkles."
2015,RW,73,212,32,ARI,,Christian Fischer,"Fischer was pretty effective this season playing in the upper half of the USNTDP lineup. He's got size and skill, and immediately draws eyes when he's on the ice. He doesn't have elite puck skills, but he's pretty coordinated and creative, maintains possession well and makes tough plays. His offensive IQ is a very impressive trait. I've seen flashes of above-average skating, but he's not that explosive out of the gate. Fischer can be very effective when he drives the net and uses his body, but his physical game is somewhat inconsistent. His defensive play ticked up as the season went along, but that probably won't be his calling card as a pro.",,,,,,,"Fischer is a Notre Dame commit who plays a solid two way game. He displays some good offensive tools to go along with his size and defensive play. Not the quickest skater but he moves
fairly well and will get from point-A to point-B effectively. He can improve his foot-speed, though.
He isn't super creative with the puck, but illustrates tremendous vision with the puck and the
ability to make feeds from the outside or from below the goal line to create a scoring chance.
Fischer is tough to compete with in the offensive zone as he outworks and outmuscles most
players down low. He is very strong on the puck and tough to contain. 215-pounds stuffed into
a six-foot-one frame, the guy is a dump truck on ice. He uses his size well to win the puck and
make plays off the boards and out of the corners. He is extremely talented in puck protection
and likes to drive the net. He also likes to place himself in front of the net and it's entertaining
watching defenders try to move him. He also has a heavy shot, which makes his power forward
game very impressive. He is not a skilled one-on-one puck handler, not an overly creative offensive player and not overly speedy. Also, he prefers to use the simple plays and utilize his power
game to produce chances, showing little evidence of high-end hockey sense and leaving doubt
that he will be a top six forward at the next level."
2015,C,71.25,188,33,TBL,,Mitchell Stephens,"Stephens isn't the tallest guy, but he was a top player for Saginaw this season and played well at the Ivan Hlinka tournament and under-18 world championships. He really turned his season around in the past few months of the season. Speed and pace define Stephens' game, as he's a fantastic skater whose speed is high-end. Stephens' stride generates so much power, he looks like he's gliding over the ice at times.

He has great work ethic on the ice, battling through checks well, getting to the net, and coming back on defense with tenacity. Stephens kills off penalties pretty well and exhibits a lot of energy on the ice. He plays a fast yet smart game, as he makes fine decisions with the puck and can set up plays. He's not overly skilled, but he can certainly create some offense by himself.",,,,,,,"Stephens is a complete player. He plays well at both ends of the rink, and provided the Spirit
with a solid face-off man. He's a diligent skater, and you can't help but admire his work ethic. He
plays solid defense, and saw an expanded role on the PK, as the Spirit lack a bit of depth up the
middle this season. He has the ability to be a puck distributor with his combination of vision and
passing ability. With a number of veterans gone from the Spirits squad this season, Stephens
was elevated into a leadership role with the club. Definitely a kid who will lead by example. He
does make a few mistakes, like holding on to the puck too long, and waiting for a play develop
instead of making a play himself. His laid-back approach may catch the ire of fans, but he's a
solid player who won't be too cute with the puck in situations where it is uncalled for. Needs to
improve his consistency. Coming out of Minor Midget, and even after looking good at a summer
tournament, more was expected of Stephens offensively and it wasn't until a couple months into
the season that he really started to produce like many had hoped. Really impressive at the U18
Championships where he captained Team Canada. Not high-end upside but has many intangibles that make him an attractive prospect to develop in a potential support role."
2015,D,71.25,197,34,TML,,Travis Dermott,"After being selected in the ninth round in the OHL draft, he's seen his stock rise quite a bit this season. He's a two-way defenseman but his value is tiled more toward offense. He rarely forces plays, and makes good outlets under pressure. He's slightly undersized, but Dermott does battle hard for pucks and shows fine defensive IQ. Overall, his defensive-zone play projects to be about average as a pro, although he's been solid in that area as an OHLer.",,,,,,,"Dermott is an intelligent two-way blueliner. He is a fluid skater who has strong legs and generates power with every stride he takes. He is great on his feet in transition and can get up to
speed quickly while carrying the puck with confidence. He maintains possession at top speed
and controls the puck extremely well. He makes superb plays with the puck: both simple and
effective to get the puck up ice and create scoring opportunities. He sees the ice in front of him,
giving him the ability to see lanes and make smart, sharp passes both short- and long-range.
His best asset is his hockey sense and smarts; he always seems to make the right play whether
on the breakout or in his own zone. He has a cannon of a shot and can really blast it through
traffic on goal. He exudes confidence, patience and creativity. Plays his man hard and uses his
body to separate the puck. He will step up for an open ice hit if he sees the time and the need
for it but is not an overly physical player on a consistent basis. He brings confident energy to
the back end that his teammates seem to feed off of. Defensively, he plays his man hard and
blocks shooting/passing lanes that come available while forcing attackers to turn over the puck."
2015,LW,71.25,172,35,CAR,,Sebastian Aho,"Aho had a fine season, including lengthy stints in Finland's top league, playing in the top nine for Finland at the WJC and excelling during under-18 tournaments. He skates pretty well, and while he doesn't have blazing speed, it's certainly above average and enough to pressure defensemen off the rush. He's a very skilled and smart offensive player who won't make overly flashy plays but makes quick, creative decisions and moves the puck very well. His vision is high-end and can be a real threat on the power play.

Aho's hockey IQ translates well to defense, where he's shown during international play he can be quite effective, even when playing ahead of his age group. The main issue with Aho is his physical game. He's 5-11, 170 pounds and doesn't engage as much or as well as you'd hope someone would with his frame.",,,,,,,"Aho is a relentless and determined workhorse who plays an aggressive game on the penalty kill and shows well on and off the puck. Aho's defensive game and overall awareness is
remarkable. He makes smart plays to get the puck out, will offer support down low in his own
end, and is active in trying to separate the puck from the man. He will take a hit to make a play,
dishing the puck off under pressure and absorbing the check on the wall. Pressures the point
and positions himself in the right area of the ice. His awareness and hockey sense all over the
ice is a strength. He knows where the puck is going, making his anticipation and reaction a major strength of his game. Makes excellent short-range passes as he helps to pull defenders in
close and open up some space to get a shot off. Has a nose for the net and is constantly buzzing
around the slot and driving the net for rebounds at even strength. Aho can fly up ice when he
gets moving thanks to his above average acceleration and good first step form stationary. With
all that, however, he lacks high-end offensive skills that will make him a point producer at the
NHL level. His upside is limited, but as long as an NHL team knows what they are getting, he
does have value as a bottom six and PK specialist."
2015,RW,76.75,186,36,OTT,,Gabriel Gagne,,,,,,,,"Gagne is an under-the-radar prospect with developing goal-scoring instincts. Right away, Gagne's size catches your eye. A tall, lanky right winger, he skates very well for a player of his size and really uses his stride well. His hands, however, are not too slick. A small concern is his balance as he can be knocked off the puck more easily than you'd expect from a guy his size and has trouble staying on his feet at times. Call it the growing into his frame, maybe. Gagne saw a lot of ice time in Victoriaville this season. Gagne has the ability to get into prime scoring space, like the slot in the offensive zone or setting up just off the circle. He is always moving his feet and thinking of where to get to when he doesn't have the puck. Gagne is pretty aggressive as well and finishes his checks every chance he gets. He is very good along the wall in his own end and is able to coral the puck and make good plays under hard pressure. Gagne's size and hockey sense are developing strengths, but he will absolutely need to put some muscle on his six-foot-five frame, especially his lower body strength if he wants to play at the pro level. While he will never become a flashy offensive playmaker, he has potential as a solid power forward with the ability to add secondary scoring but it will take some time before he gets there."
2015,D,77,196,37,OTT,,Brandon Carlo,"Carlo had a fine second season in the WHL and was on USA's under-20 team in a decent role as well. Carlo is a big defenseman who plays a tough brand of hockey and can defend at even strength and on the PK quite well, using his size to get in lanes and clear the net. He has solid enough hockey sense and can anticipate some of the faster plays, and he knows how to transition the puck.

His skating isn't fantastic, as his stride can be a little short, but overall, he moves well for a big guy and has the puck skills to get up into the attack. He could curtail some of the mistakes he makes, especially on forcing offensive plays, and continue to fill out his massive frame. He projects as a defensive defenseman with a small chance at bringing offense too. I've also seen him play his off-wing side somewhat effectively.",,,,,,,"A big, nasty, physical defensive defender. He's an absolute monster out on the ice and skates
extremely well for his size. His footwork is not perfect but definitely at a higher level than you
would expect for someone who is six-foot-five. He's got a good powerful skating stride and
displays good lateral mobility. He is constantly in players' faces, chirping and talking trash. He
is a big fan of using his stick in a dirty way behind the play; a borderline dirty player who has a
very mean edge to his game. He is very involved in the play, looking to jump up into the rush
and push the pace when the opportunity is there. He passes the puck well and shows off a very
hard shot. Does a good job getting himself into shooting position, while also showing the ability
to handle the puck in such a way to give himself space to shoot it. He has solid instincts to go
with his skating and snarl. He is a big minute-muncher type–think Braydon Colborn–who is best
at keeping things simple and safe. While he does rely a lot on his size and strength at this level,
we think he has the toolbox to still “play the game” at the next level. His size and skating combo
is rare and coveted by NHL teams. "
2015,LW,76,204,38,CBJ,,Paul Bittner,"I'm lower on Bittner than the industry, but it's hard to ignore that he has some appealing characteristics. He's 6-4, but skates like he's 5-11. His skating mechanics are very smooth, and he can be a handful on the rush due to his speed and frame. Bittner isn't a pure dangler, but he doesn't have rock hands, either. His shot is arguably high end, as it comes off the tape with scorching velocity and he can locate it well.

His hockey sense is bit of a question mark, in that he makes some odd decisions, but he shows good vision and creates scoring chances. Bittner's defensive play could also use some tweaks, but he shows effort and average reads. He could be a scoring power forward in the NHL if his development goes well.",,,,,,,"A behemoth of a kid, Bittner has the size that NHL teams crave in a potential power
forward. Straight line speed is one of his better attributes as he uses his long and powerful limbs to
pump vigorously and push the pace of play. Once Bittner gets moving, he approaches the play with
reckless abandon and is not easily stopped or moved off course. Willing to throw his weight around
and lay the body when the opportunity presents itself. Has a solid wrist shot with some real whip to
it. Speaking of his shot, it's a strong part of his repertoire; he's not afraid to shoot either. He's got a
quick release. We would describe his wrister as being ‘heavy.' He sees time on the top powerplay
unit in Portland and it's his role to get in front of the net and screen the goalie. He is pretty good in
that aspect and utilizes his long reach to sweep home rebounds. He looks to process the game
at a high level, making quick and efficient plays in traffic to move the puck along under pressure.
His puck possession skills are very simplistic, without much flair and creativity in dekes. His
main asset is his puck protection with help from his massive frame. Classified as a two-way
power forward, he seems committed to getting into the lanes and using his reach to take
away space; however, his lack of quickness and lateral mobility doesn't always allow him to
match up well with agile players. He plays a rough and tumble game along the boards and
can simply outwork players with his strength and reach. Showed his sheer determination
on the wall and on zone entries; his size is no match for some of the WHL's defenders. He
remains poised with the puck on his stick and dishes clean passes on the rush. Bittner
has an eye for scoring and is lethal below the hash marks. Finished the season on a
points tear after starting off a little slowly. His temperament is an area that is holding him back at times.
Does not attack the net like you would like but instead lurks around hoping the play
will come to him. Consistency is an area that will need addressing as he goes cold
for far too long, games at a time, and really needs to feel confident in himself to
get the most out of his abilities. His skating, while it has improved, is still a little
rough and his acceleration is still a bit clunky. His footwork is a legitimate area of
concern, as he looks to be still learning how to coordinate all the moving parts
together. This is one of those areas that should straighten itself out as he gets
older, more coordinated and adds much more leg strength. His passing game
can be very hit or miss. Usually because he rushes the pass instead of taking
the time needed to get set. "
2015,LW,74.5,205,39,COL,,A.J. Greer,,,,,,,,"The power forward is a very good skater with powerful strides and very good agility for his
size. He could continue adding even more muscle mass to that big frame of his, but he is extremely smart with his stick and the way he uses his reach and size. On the cycle, he moves
his feet quickly and is very skilled in using his hips to keep opponents away from the puck. In
addition, he has a very good understand of how to pressure players. He is very good on the
forecheck with a quick stick and great anticipation of the play. He also joins the rush with speed
and likes to drive towards scoring areas. But with all that said and done, he has questionable
offensive hockey sense. While he understands how to pressure players, he isn't that great when
being pressured himself; has a bit of a controlled panic to his game in possessing. He can at
times force a pass to nowhere or to a place where no play was to be seen just to alleviate the
pressure. Has a powerful shot that is dangerous but will need some fine tuning on its release.
Extremely raw, but who will want a six-foot-three power forward who can skate, plays hard
and has very good forechecking hockey sense? Most NHL GM's will be lining up to say “Yes,
please.” Greer oozes raw potential. He has the size, which he uses very well and his energy can
produce offense and force turnovers. However, he needs a few years in the college level learning how to play quicker and smarter. If he can put it all together, he has a future as a potential
power winger in the NHL."
2015,D,74.5,204,40,COL,,Nicolas Meloche,"I haven't been blown away by Meloche in any game this season, but he's consistently impressed in most games. He's an above-average skater who closes his gaps very well on his checks. He can activate into the attack, but he's not a super aggressive player in that aspect.

However, Meloche is a very aggressive physical player who delivers punishing hits. He can kill penalties, though he could fix a read or two in his positioning; but, he makes defensive plays. Meloche is a solid puck mover and he gets a ton of shots through to goal due to his shooting skills and his hockey IQ. He projects as an all-situations defenseman.",,,,,,,
2014,D,75.5,216,1,ARI,,Aaron Ekblad,"Ekblad is the top player in the 2014 draft class. He's a monster on the back end at 6-foot-4, 216 pounds, and plays the game with an edge. Some may point to his size as the reason Ekblad dominates, but he does so much more than just hit and win battles: he skates well with good power in his stride and excellent pivots; he has really developed the offensive side of his game, with above-average puck skills and great coordination for a big man; he sees the ice well, can be creative along the point and join the attack on top of having a high-end shot from deep. Ekblad doesn't have any outstanding skills in particular, and he can still make an odd mistake, but the total package of what he brings to the table is unique, especially considering he's a blueliner. He's a potential star defenseman and may have another level to his game if developed properly.",,,,,,,"Ekblad is the complete package, a strong two-way defenseman with better than
NHL-desirable size. He gets to where he needs to just fne with a long, powerful stride, and consistently uses his natural gifts such as strength and reach to make the right plays. Ekblad is strong on
his skates and is near impossible to move. He battles hard along the boards and in front of his own
net, rarely losing a battle. He closes gaps quickly and uses his frame to get into lanes and close
off options. Ekblad has no problem staying locked to his man down low. He is physical when he
wants to be and can make life diffcult on opponents. He is extremely smart, with a high hockey IQ
and is able to read the play coming at him quickly, making the simple, effective plays that most
his age would not. He is not one to go coast to coast and try to beat the entire opposing team
with the puck, but he does carry it well and is able to get by opponents by protecting the puck
with his long reach. Ekblad has no problem taking what is there and adapting to whomever
his D-partner might be. If he is paired with a puck rusher, Ekblad stays back; if his partner
prefers to play it safe, Ekblad will jump up when the opportunity presents itself. He shows a
lot of poise and patience with the puck on his stick. Ekblad makes strong outlets and has an
outstanding mid- to long-range pass that is typically on the mark. He displays strong vision
and timing, confdently making those passes. His point shot is one of his top weapons as
it is both extremely hard and accurate, but also he uses it at the right time and places it in
proper locations. Ekblad is not one to just drive the puck into shin pads. He is the team
Captain in Barrie and a vocal leader on every other team he played on, showing strong
leadership qualities that will translate well to the NHL level. While he is a very well-rounded prospect already, Ekblad does
have some areas that, with improvement, could push him into that elite-level prospect status. His foot speed and ability to transition his skating can be a little fat as
is the case with most big guys his age. While Ekblad's top speed is just fne, he
would be well served to improve his initial burst and overall agility. Despite his
impressive size and ability to use his strength effectively at times, he does not
always do so consistently. Ekblad is at his defensive best playing with a physical aggressiveness and meanness; this is one area where better consistency
would go a long way to improve his overall effectiveness."
2014,C,72.75,185,2,BUF,,Sam Reinhart,"dynamic right-handed center, and is the best pure passer in the draft class. His ability to dictate tempo elevates his game to a distinct level. Reinhart can make all kinds of plays with the puck, and his elite hockey sense stands out regularly in terms of the passing lanes he sees that even an observer with a bird's-eye view may not spot. He has great hands and can make a lot of plays when he goes one-on-one against a defenseman. He has average size (6-1, 183 pounds), but will work hard in battles and can play an average physical game, although I have heard some scouts criticize him in that area. One of the skills that distinguishes Reinhart is his smart play in the defensive zone, shutting down top players and possessing top-quality abilities on the penalty kill.",,,,,,,"The 2014 NHL Draft's top forward prospect has delivered consistently all season for
Kootenay. His top asset is his mind as he is always a step or two ahead of his opponents. Because of
his intelligence, Reinhart can play a ton of minutes in all situations as your top-line center. His positioning and decision-making skills are elite. While on the surface, he is lacking the fash of a typical top
pick, Reinhart seems to always fnd a way to forward the puck to a teammate and seems to thread
diffcult passes across the ice with ease. His vision is outstanding and he is creative in a discrete
way. The typical Sam Reinhart goal: him sitting back in the play and waiting for a moment to fnd
open ice around the net, and in a split second, striking with a quick wrist shot from that open ice
after his teammate found him with a well-placed pass. His usual accurate shot has improved all
season both in its release and velocity. He is strong on the draw, and shows poise and composure with the puck. He uses his body well as a shield for the puck. Reinhart has the rare ability
to slow the pace down when he gets the puck. Shows very good anticipation in the defensive
zone. He looks unassertive in his end at times, but his timing is just excellent. Reinhart always seems to lurk around, but the next thing you know, he has picked off a pass with his
quick stick and excellent positioning, and in a fash, has started the transition up ice. Poise
with and without the puck is phenomenal and hardly ever panics or gets worked up. While it is not really a weakness--more of his identity--Reinhart is not
a fashy kid with an impressive set of wheels and the ability to dangle the puck through
defenders for a highlight-reel play. Instead, he is very effective and effcient. Not the
typical top-fve draft pick in that regard. His skating lacks the burst and explosiveness
you want in a top-line type forward prospect, even if he is rarely, if ever, behind the
play. He lacks the speed to project as highly effective off the rush. Reinhart looks to
be lacking intensity and can frustrate with his perceived lack of urgency. He also
does not have a physical element to his game, but instead relies on his hockey
sense and smarts to win most battles."
2014,C,73.5,204,3,EDM,,Leon Draisaitl,"Leon is one of the best -- if not the best -- NHL prospects to come out of Germany as a first-time draft-eligible player. He measures in at 6-1 and 209 pounds, with the ability to protect the puck at a high level. Draisaitl shows a good strength level and competitiveness in battles. His hockey sense is also exceptional as he processes the game at a really quick tempo. This translates to his best offensive quality: his vision. Draisaitl's quick passing skills, knowledge of how to make defenders move to open lanes, and the creativity he shows as a playmaker are unique, and make him a dangerous player from inside the offensive blue line. He's also got some flash to his game, and his defense is solid. When he gets going, his speed is average but his first few steps are a bit sluggish and his stride isn't the cleanest.",,,,,,,"Draisaitl is a big, puck-protecting playmaker with excellent vision. He shrugs off checks
with ease and shows elite-level poise in his ability to distribute the puck under pressure. Draisaitl skates
with a wide base, which provides decent straight-line speed and good balance along the boards. He is
a very good puck protector as he uses his shoulders and reach to create distance between defenders. Thinks the game at a high level, always seems to fnd a way to get the puck to his teammates
in dangerous areas and brings different looks every time he enters the offensive zone. Very smooth
hands in traffc and on the fy. Makes good decisions with the puck and has elite vision. He uses his
hands and strength to effectively create space for himself. Draisaitl's passing abilities and vision
are at an elite level. He has an innate sense of where his teammates are at all times. He shows
great touch and accuracy on all his passes, and he is equally adept on both the forehand and
backhand. He shows exceptional creativity and even if his passes can't be made tape to tape,
he puts the puck in open space where his teammates will get to it frst. He possesses a strong
shot, has a quick release and doesn't take long to get the puck off his stick and accurately on
net. His play in the offensive zone away from the puck is also impressive. Very subtly can go
undetected, fade behind coverage and shake defenders to get himself in an open position. Intensity wanes from shift to shift; if he is to be successful, he will
need to bring it each and every night. He will have to learn the small things like fnishing
checks, keeping his feet moving and becoming a harder player to play against defensively for him to play at the NHL level. While he possesses good size, he isn't particularly physical. He could also show a little more aggressiveness on the forecheck.
Draisaitl could stand to improve defensively. He is not the most urgent backchecker,
and he can occasionally be caught watching the play. He can have a defeatist/negative attitude, and show poor body language when things get tough and don't go his
way or if a teammate fumbles a prime scoring opportunity that he created. Skating
isn't a major strength of Draisaitl's. He has an awkward skating style and doesn't
have great speed. He does look sluggish quite often, mainly because he stops
his forward progress when making a play. Every time he needles a pass to a
teammate, he seems to be gliding rather than pumping his legs. That leads us
into his lack of lower-body strength and his skinny legs. If he can spend the
summer adding some muscle to his legs and hips, he could have a chance at
playing in the NHL as soon as next season; otherwise."
2014,C,72.25,178,4,CGY,,Sam Bennett,"It's hard to find a specific part of Bennett's game that is weak; he's simply a fantastic all-around forward. He's a really fast and energetic skater who can play at a high pace and embrace a pressure style with high amounts of effectiveness. However, Bennett's best quality is his hockey IQ. He sees the ice really well, and can dominate the puck in terms of possession due to his hockey brain on top of his speed and puck skills. Bennett has flashy elements to his game, while also being able to generate chances through work ethic and instincts, and has an impressive shot as well. Bennett battles well for pucks, with what one NHL exec coins ""superb natural balance"" in terms of his center of gravity in board confrontations. He also embraces the physical game, can lay some quality hits and is a fine defensive forward. He could get stronger, improve his positioning a little, and maybe not try to force the tough plays, but for the most part he's the complete package.",,,,,,,"A very dynamic forward with an all-around great package of tools, Bennett is an extremely quick and powerful skater. He can blow past defenders with his speed and power, then fnds his
way to the net to score goals or make opportunities for his teammates. Creativity is one of his biggest
assets and he is not afraid to try new things. The puck seems to follow Bennett. His shot is already
pro-caliber, a quick and hard release that catches goaltenders off balance. He is great at finding open scoring areas, and is not afraid to go to rough areas to score. He has really soft quick hands in
tight. Bennett is a natural playmaker. He shows uncanny vision and passing ability. He is constantly
looking for open teammates and can put the puck into the smallest of areas. Bennett uses his size
and strength to protect the puck on the rush, around the net and in the corners; this ability allows
him to be so effective in entry into and staying in the offensive zone. He is a hard worker who
likes the physical element of the game. Bennett is aggressive on the forecheck, leading to him
cause many turnovers. His hockey sense and smarts are also a developing area that you can
see grow with every game he plays. His offensive instincts are very high and he is a threat
to score from anywhere in the offensive zone. Bennett is a defensively smart player. More
often than not, he is in the right position and shows good awareness. He has a very active
stick and gets to a lot of pucks frst using his speed. He shows the ability to make smart,
simple plays in his own zone. Bennett is strong in the faceoff circle and has developing
leadership qualities. He battled the tendency last season and earlier this season to
over-handle the puck and try to do too much on his own. He will need to continue to
learn how to utilize his linemates as he progresses toward his NHL dream. He will
also need to add some considerable strength as his game has the grit and edge, but
he could fnd it a whole new experience if he brings that physical element against
men. With his skill and creativity also come some negatives that he will learn to
better manage as. At times, he can try to do too much and be too creative, leading
to turnovers, when the simple and right play is staring him in the face."
2014,LW,73.5,182,5,NYI,,Michael Dal Colle,"""Puck possessor"" is the common word thrown around when scouts discuss Dal Colle. ""He makes all the right plays, he's very patient, he sees the ice well, and his team always has the puck when he's out there,"" said one NHL head scout. Dal Colle's puck skills and instincts make him a force when he's on the ice, but what makes him a top-end prospect is the size he brings to the table (6-2, 172 pounds), on top of the fantastic skill components. He also possesses a high-end shot. In terms of pure offensive potential and skills, he's right in the same category as Reinhart and Bennett. I have heard from some scouts who like his skating, although I see him as more average in that regard. He'll have some good moments in the defensive zone, but could stand to work on his positioning. He could also stand to be less bashful in corner play.",,,,,,,"A powerful and dynamic winger with high-end offensive skills and vision. Dal Colle is a
high-level skater. He has a strong stride, a solid top gear and gets around the ice effectively. He shows
great agility and balance by being hard to knock off the puck. Dal Colle has the ability to maintain puck
possession, even with defenders draped all over him. He's extremely hard to knock off the puck, and
causes headaches for defenders with his balance and reach. He has tight hands in close and the
ability to fnish in tight. He shows good control at top speed, and possesses the skill to beat opposing players one on one. Dal Colle uses his big frame and solid foundation to be physical in all three
zones. Not a guy to drop the gloves often or even scuffe after the whistle, but he will stick up for
himself and not be pushed around. He consistently fnishes his checks and causes turnovers with
a strong forecheck. Has a good mind for the game, and sets up well on the power play. He is always looking to make a play to help his team. He plays the game at a high level and competes
hard. Dal Colle has great playmaking skill and is a pass-frst player. He shows good vision and
passing ability both with short, quick give and goes as well as those long-range dishes. He
uses his big frame to protect the puck while looking for open teammates. He has a quick release on his shots and can pick corners, making him dangerous anywhere in the offensive
zone. An area of his game that is underrated is his defensive play. Dal Colle is responsible
in getting back and generally stays in solid position when the play is in his own zone. He
has some room for growth in this aspect, but is far from a liability. One area of improvement for Dal Colle would have to be his skating. He's progressed quite nicely from last year, but he still needs to develop a stronger frst few steps as his acceleration in tight needs to catch up to his hand speed. His
frame has much room to add considerable strength to it and once he does add that
muscle, he will be really hard to handle for opposing defenses as he bursts toward
the net. For a guy who scored 39 goals this season, you don't hear this much, but
he would be even more effective if he shot the puck more."
2014,RW,72.75,208,6,VAN,,Jake Virtanen,"Virtanen is an all-engines-go type of player who put up a ton of goals in his second WHL season. His best attribute is his skating, and he may be the best skater in this draft class. ""He has that second gear to blow by defenders that other players don't have,"" said one scout. Virtanen's ability to gain the zone is very desirable and he's a player you want with the puck in transition because of his speed and impressive puck skills. He forechecks well, hustles to get his defensive assignments and plays hard on the penalty kill. Virtanen shot is plus, as he gets it off quick, with torque and accuracy. He won't be a team's primary puck carrier or scoring-chance creator, but there's budding upside with Virtanen on that front if he continues to develop well.",,,,,,,"An offensive minded winger with an impressive blend of physicality and fnesse. Virtanen is a solid skater with both an explosive burst and high-end top speed. He is also very strong on
his feet along the boards, making him diffcult to contain due to his combination of speed and strength.
Virtanen is a very confdent player with the puck on his stick. He displays quick hands in the corners
and is a threat to break through defensive coverage with very little time or space needed. He is able
to create options for himself by consistently having the puck in a position to either shoot or pass.
The ease and speed at which he corrals pucks off the outside edge of his skates is well above his
peers. Virtanen is an adequate passer, however there is no question he is a shoot-frst player.
If he has the puck in a dangerous spot in the offensive zone, he is probably going to shoot. He
is dangerous every time on the ice with his speed and an absolute bullet of a shot. He has an
exceptionally quick release, and requires little space or time to unleash his cannon. Virtanen
is particularly strong when driving to the net and creating havoc. He is very adept at picking
corners and fnding weak spots in the opposing goaltender. Virtanen is a very physical player. He punishes defenders on the forecheck and explodes into hits. Virtanen also uses his
strength to rag the puck in the offensive zone. He is very strong against the boards and
rarely loses battles. Virtanen displays elite offensive-zone skills. He can beat you with
speed or strength, and is always looking to attack the net. Virtanen consistently drives the
play when he has the puck and is not content with simply moving it around the perimeter.
He has a solid understanding of defensive assignments and he has good awareness,
but certainly his main focus is in the offensive zone. Virtanen went through his share of ups and downs this season,
with his effort level and willingness to give 100% not being consistent from one viewing to the next. His effort level away from the puck is an area that needs improvement. He has big-league strength and skating abilities, but he doesn't use them
enough to win the puck. You see Virtanen get a jolt of energy when he has the
puck or it is within his reach, but not often enough when he is backchecking or
trying to gain space in the offensive zone. He just isn't great when the puck isn't
on his stick. His strength, when he uses it, allows him to dominate at this level,
but the fear is he won't be able to create offense off the rush in the NHL like
he does in junior. Because he hasn't quite learned to utilize the cycle/possession-style offense, his game might not translate smoothly to the next level. "

He's also very mobile in every direction, he's got a great top speed to rush the puck, and he's agile with his turns/pivots and tight space maneuvering. Fleury also has the ability to QB a power play. His main drawback is his hockey sense, as he can be an overly risky player who can try to do too much, and make costly turnovers. He has some good stretches defensively, coupled with some stretches that make you hide your eyes. He could be a potential two-way horse in the NHL if he fully pans out.",,,,,,,"Fleury is a big, athletic, two-way defenseman who can do it all. He is a world-class
skater and just a real athlete for a 17 year old. He shows a smooth stride, great mobility, and quick
transitions. He gets around the ice quickly. Fleury shows he can rush the puck, beating opponents with
speed as well as using it to get back after joining or leading the rush. Likes to pick his spots when
rushing the puck and typically only does so when he knows he can get back and cover his defensive obligations. Has the ability to control the fow of the game when he is on the ice and has the
puck in his possession. Fleury sees the ice well and provides a quality frst pass. He makes crisp
outlet passes and smart decisions when he has the puck. His poise and patience with the puck
are good. He doesn't get rattled easily. Fleury has a lot of offensive upside. He has a big shot
from the point that has the ability to beat the goalie clean. He is a smart player who understands
how to play the game in all three zones. Fleury shows an ability to read plays and make smart
decisions. Can be physical in the corners and shows lot of confdence in open ice, whether
it is stepping up to take away a passing lane or carrying the puck up ice. Fleury plays a big,
physical brand of hockey. He makes big hits without losing position. He makes life miserable
for opposing forwards. If he can hit you, he will. Fleury plays with a nasty edge. Fleury is
strong in his own zone keeping threats to the outside. He uses his big reach and quickness
to win races to pucks, box out opponents and steer the play out safely. Very aggressive
in closing gaps and pressuring guys breaking into his zone. He clears the front of his net
and gives opposing players no time. Fleury makes smart, simple plays in his own zone.
He is an elite defenseman with strong range and the potential to be a major contributor
at both ends of the ice at the game's highest level. He is a true leader on the backend
and a trustworthy minute-muncher who can be a jack of all trades for his team. Despite being a solid overall prospect, there are times when
his play has looked timid and indecisive. He has moments when he gets caught
watching the puck or is hesitant to rush the puck, or he has games when his feet
aren't moving. Also, there are times when he is prone to being drawn slightly out
of position, but these are all areas that should improve with more experience.
Consistency needs to improve as he can be tentative, although most of his onagain, off-again play is due to his confdence level. "
2014,RW,71,169,8,TML,,William Nylander,"The son of longtime NHLer Michael Nylander may be the most gifted pure offensive talent in the draft. William had a so-so first half when he struggled to find a role, but had a tremendous second half. Because of that turnaround, I've heard NHL scouts rank him anywhere from No. 2 overall to the 20s. He was over a point per game pace with Sodertalje in the SHL-2, setting a season record for points by an under-18 player, and played around 20 minutes per game with Modo down the stretch. Nylander's pucks skills are elite, as he can be described as ""an artist"" by some scouts in terms of how well he controls the puck, and the unique plays he makes. Nylander's hockey sense is fantastic as well, in terms of his vision, and offensive intellect. You combine that with a pretty good top gear and Nylander can create all sorts of havoc offensively. Nylander can deke a defender out, make a highlight-reel pass, speed by players. He's not the biggest guy (5-11, 181 pounds), his defensive play needs work, and he can try to do too much sometimes.",,,,,,,"An impressive dangler with the puck and fashy playmaker. Nylander likely possesses
the quickest, most creative hands in the draft and can really dance around the offensive zone with the
puck. He sees the ice like few kids his age can and has the ability to distribute the puck through the
tightest of lanes. His feet add to his impressive offensive abilities as he is explosive and quick north
to south as well as east to west. Nylander has a fast top speed and can maintain that speed with the
puck on his stick. His skating gives him the ability to be elusive with the puck in the offensive zone
while he awaits the play to set up. He is versatile and can play either center or wing effectively.
Nylander is smart and thinks the game faster than most, reading the play and seeing an opportunity arise before the defense can close it off. His hand-eye coordination is superb and he has
a high hockey IQ. Nylander's wrist shot is both hard and accurate, and he can really fool the
goaltender with his release. He's at his best when using his linemates and making short, clever
passes on the offensive cycle to set up a chance. The kid just love to create offensively and
has the natural skills to do so. Nylander is always willing to go to the net and play in traffc
both with and without the puck. This kid's character has been called into question as he has been
painted as a malcontent, a selfsh kid who does not buy into the team mentality and full
of self-serving attitude. His attitude and entitlement issues were the main reason for his
team-hopping drama this past season. Nylander's play on the ice mirrored his off-the ice attitude as he played the game selfshly many nights. He needs to learn to utilize his
teammates more effectively going forward. His size is also a running concern for NHL
teams as he still has a young boy's frame with much room to add strength. Nylander
currently does not have much of a physical game. His lack of functional strength is
most evident when he is playing with the men in the SHL or Allsvenskan. Although
he can be strong on the forecheck, he has a way to go defensively as his effort
level and positioning in his own zone are nowhere near what they will need to be
for him to play in the NHL. His consistency will need to improve as he can have
an impressive match one night, making you think this kid needs to be in the
conversation for top spot in the draft and the next night, he is ineffective, easily
pushed off the puck and only showing a fash or two of the effective game he
displayed the previous night."
2014,LW,71,162,9,WPG,,Nikolaj Ehlers,"The Danish Ehlers landed in North America with a bang, scoring well over a point-per-game pace in his rookie QMJHL season. He's an electrifying offensive talent who stands out on a regular basis. His skating is easily plus -- especially his top gear -- as he turns defenders regularly. Ehlers generates speed so easily with his first few steps and has a clean, easy stride. He complements that with a large arsenal of stick-handling moves. One scout notes that Ehlers doesn't just ooze skill, but he can make all the tough skill plays at a high tempo. He sees the ice pretty well, and can make the really difficult passes. He's got an above-average shot, with smooth technique on his snap, and the puck explodes quickly off his tape. Ehlers isn't the biggest guy (6-0, 163 pounds) or the most physical, although he battles well. His pure scoring potential is what gets him in the conversation here.",,,,,,,"Ehlers is a slick and fashy offensive-minded winger who can change the game in an
instant. The “Dancing Dane” as he has been called by some has arguably the best set of wheels in the
draft. Dangerous offensive player who keeps his feet moving non-stop. Top-end acceleration and topend speed. He has breakaway speed and can go from a standstill to top speed as quickly as anyone
available to draft this season. His change of pace can be so drastic that he can make just about
any QMJHL defenseman dizzy as he blows by them. He plays on his off-wing and creates chances
with sharp cuts to the middle complemented by an explosive wrister. His puck skills are fashy and
artsy – displays very quick, creative hands. Ehlers has an impressive arsenal of dekes he will pull
in traffc, and has great hand-eye coordination, which makes him very fun to watch. Protects the
puck well in the offensive zone with his reach and quickness. Has a great shot, both forehand
and backhand, which he can lift past a goaltender with very little room needed. Good, short
tape-to-tape passes as Ehlers keeps this part of his game pretty simple. He is a dangerous
forechecker and solid backchecker using his speed and quickness to disrupt. He has shown
some potential on the penalty kill this season as well. Strength and lack of ideal NHL size are his two biggest knocks as this
electrifying forward will need to fnd that balance of added muscle without losing his elite
speed or darting agility. Ehlers is not a physical guy and likely never will be a big hitter
or drop the gloves, but scouts would like to see him play in traffc on a more consistent
basis; something he was doing better toward the end of this season. He will also need
to improve his play without the puck and in the defensive zone before taking the next
step. Right now, he looks lost in his own zone, not for a lack of effort, but for a lack of
knowing what to do, where to be and overall defensive awareness."
2014,LW,74.25,226,10,ANA,,Nick Ritchie,"Prior to this season, Ritchie struggled with injuries and consistency, but he got on more of a solid footing in 2013-14. His toolkit is tremendous, and at his best he can be dominant. Ritchie's physical game is fantastic. He's 6-3, 235 pounds and aggressive. Ritchie attacks defenders, and is great protecting the puck. It will obviously be harder on him in the pro game, but it was near-impossible to get the puck off of him at the junior level. Ritchie's strength level is great, and I've seen bulldoze through people on the way to the net, and shoulder off multiple checks without much effort. He's got a good skill level, too. Ritchie's shot is of the high-end variety with a lot of weight behind his snaps. His defense needs some work, and he has a tendency to disappear at times (which is difficult for such a large player).",,,,,,,"Ritchie is a big power forward who is strong on his feet and is impossible to knock
around. He has great acceleration for such a big man, and can change his speed in order to break
away from opponents or win races to the puck. From a stationary position, it only takes him a few short
seconds to reach his top speed. Ritchie brings tremendous physicality to the game and uses his size
advantage regularly. Ritchie is at his best when playing like a runaway freight train, crushing opponents, getting in their face after the whistle and driving the puck to the net. Doing so, he creates a
ton of space for himself and his teammates. Ritchie is like a brick wall running at players and when
they try to hit him back, they bounced right off. He battles for loose pucks, using his size and speed
to get to the right position to win the most battles. He punishes players with body checks and can
have a high compete level that makes him impossible for Major Junior defenders to contain.
Ritchie does a great job of creating a screen in front of the opposition's net on the power play
and he gets his stick in position to defect the puck. Ritchie has great hockey sense; he sees
plays develop and gets into open ice to receive passes. He makes good, quick decisions with
and without the puck. Ritchie is extremely competitive and puts in a strong physical effort
most shifts; he has offensive instincts knowing when to drive to the net and when to hang
back to create a better scoring chance for a linemate. Ritchie uses his body to protect
the puck and has quick hands that enable him to get away from opponents when under
pressure. Ritchie exhibits tremendous patience with the puck when under pressure and
regularly gets the puck on net. He makes good, crisp passes to teammates' sticks, and
he possesses a dangerous and extremely hard and quick selection of shots. Ritchie
takes charge on the ice and has an air of confdence about him. The big thing for Ritchie is his durability and health. He has had
an injury in each of his three Major Junior seasons, keeping him from being in the
lineup and playing up to his full potential even when he does dress. NHL teams
want their big, nasty power forwards to be durable and his injury history could
cause his stock to fall a little on draft day. His effort level and making sure he is
engaged from shift to shift are other areas that scouts hope improves as Ritchie
had a tendency to be a dominant force both physically and offensively one
night and then to only show a fash or two of that same game over the next
couple contests. The team that drafts him will have to expect that consistency
to come with maturity. His conditioning and his defensive effort are two other
areas that need improvement for him to fulfll his NHL dreams."
2014,LW,70,180,11,NSH,,Kevin Fiala,"The next great Swiss prospect, Fiala really started to turn heads from about December on. He had a strong World Junior Championship and under-18 World Championship, started playing top-six minutes in the SHL, putting up a ton of points in the process. In terms of points per game, he had the second-highest rate in the SHL among under-18 players in modern history, behind Peter Forsberg. He can make highlight-reel plays with the puck, and he's also a really good passer with great hockey IQ, and doesn't seem to turn the puck over. On the power play, Fiala is the kind of player you want controlling the puck and starting the puck movement. He's 5-11, and while that isn't ideal, he does battle hard and has a lot of drive to his game. Fiala needs to improve his defensive positioning.",,,,,,,"An ultra-skilled offensive player with quick hands. Fiala is an above-average skater,
both in agility and acceleration. He's not the biggest guy, but he has good balance and strength and
is hard to knock of the puck. Not afraid of board battles against bigger players. Fiala has a top-notch
shot, one of the best among draft-eligibles in Europe -- both hard and accurate -- and off his stick
in a fash. His backhand causes all kinds of trouble for goaltenders. Fiala has good vision and is a
creative passer. He has awesome hands. He dekes, he covers the puck well, and has good control
and stickhandling; always tries to be creative and search for the open areas. He creates offensive
opportunities for himself and his teammates with his good hockey IQ and determination. With the
puck on his stick in the offensive zone, Fiala plays at a very high pace, making him hard to defend
against by combining his fne skating with excellent puck-handling skills. Always fnds himself a
way to get that extra second with the puck. He never gives up on a play and fghts for the puck
as long as possible. Top-notch positional play, both offensively and defensively. Uses his body
well to shield the puck in the offensive zone and is strong enough to keep most opponents off
him. High-level hockey IQ and puts himself in good position to intercept passes. Plays with
great poise, always seems to be ahead of the play, frst guy to go on offense, but doesn't
neglect his defensive responsibilities. Very good confdence; doesn't hesitate to challenge
the opponent's defense and he knows where the goal is. Scrappy and likes to agitate
his opponents, often delivering small slashes and hacks after the whistle. Feisty, but he
does it perfectly, getting under his opponent's skin without taking penalties. He´s used
to older opponents, so he was able to handle the transition from J20 to SHL very well. Physically, Fiala looks bigger than listed but he doesn't really play
physical hockey. Not that you want him out there trying to run everything in a different color jersey, but there are times where he is skating along the boards or toward
a prime scoring area, and he just gives the puck up all of a sudden because he
wants to avoid contact. He can give his coaches grey hair as he gives up a lot
of turnovers trying to be fancy. That is something he'll need to improve and limit
before advancing. He is willing to take a risk in the defensive zone, carrying the
puck through areas he shouldn't. He would beneft from playing a less complicated game. Scouts also want to see him shoot more often, as he often looks
for his teammates and passes up good shooting opportunities when the right
play is just to get the puck on net."
2014,LW,74.75,205,12,ARI,,Brendan Perlini,"Perlini showed immense improvements from his 16-year-old season to this one, and emerged as one of the top first-time draft-eligible forwards. A Great Britain native, Perlini has probably the best size-to-skating ratio in the draft. He's a 6-3, 200-pound winger and gets up the ice at an elite level; Perlini's first-step quickness for his size is extremely impressive. His physical package and skill level make him a very desirable power forward-type of prospect if he improves in the physical part of the game. Perlini has quick hands and the offensive composure to make plays in tight spaces. He's also a great scorer who can finish from mid-distance. Perlini has the ability to be a game-breaker, and while he still needs to find that consistency in terms of creation and two-way play, he can be a major factor in a game.",,,,,,,"A big, smooth-skating, offensive-minded winger with loads of offensive potential. Perlini is a gifted skater, very mobile and fast on his feet. His speed sets him apart from other players on the
ice and he uses it to his advantage effectively. His frst step is huge and he accelerates quickly, even
from a stationary position. In a fash, he reaches top speed and catches up to opponents. Perlini has
top-notch hand speed and his creativity makes him lethal when the puck is on his stick. He is great
when the puck is on his stick; he is very effective and knows what to do and where to go to be successful. Even when pressured, with one or two men on him, he manages to maintain possession
and dish out smart passes. He protects the puck well against defenders and is effective in doing
so when at top speed. Perlini sees lanes before they open, and gets there to receive a pass or
to send the puck through to a teammate. His passes are both accurate and sharp. Perlini has a
nose for the net and seems to drive the net from wherever he is on the ice, with or without the
puck. He has a powerful wrist shot off the rush and it is quick off his stick from in close. Perlini
uses his speed to forecheck hard and pressure opponents to turn over the puck. He drives
the net hard, protecting the puck with his body and generating chances. He anticipates plays
and reacts extremely well, often covering for his defensemen who pinch in the offensive
zone. He is patient and does not rush, with and without the puck, allowing him to see lanes
and get there for passes and scoring chances. He is constantly moving and challenging
the opposing defensemen in hopes of making them turn over the puck. He battles hard
along the wall and does not quit on a puck battle. Perlini has tremendous hockey sense
and makes very smart plays with the puck. He is competitive and supports his teammates. Perlini is a two-way force who can get caught playing on the
perimeter too much as he does not engage physically even though he can hold his
own very well with his size. Sometimes you see him lose a puck battle along the
wall and think “How did he get outmuscled when he is larger than his opponent?”
That goes to show he has a way to go in adding strength to his impressive frame.
Perlini looked like he was going through the motions at points over the course of
the season. He would become invisible at times, and then pull off a nice move
or provide a great outlet pass to a teammate that would catch the opposition
off guard. A more conscious effort on Perlini's part when playing in his own
end could help further develop his overall game."
2014,LW,71,185,13,WSH,,Jakub Vrana,"This is a pretty high ranking, but it's slightly lower than I expected I'd end up slotting Vrana earlier this season, as he looked like one of the greatest Czech prospects in recent memory. He's one of the few Czech players to ever play as an under-age player for their under-18 and under-20 teams, alongside Michael Frolik and Jiri Hudler. There's a reasonable best-case scenario with Vrana that he'll become a top-end winger and I'll end up cringing looking back at ranking him too low. Vrana is a shifty player, with very good speed and a nice first few steps. His defense could use work. He also can try to do too much and be selfish at times. The most troubling thing with Vrana is that his development seems to be flattening out, and a downward trend is always a red flag, so there's also a non-zero chance that he busts.",,,,,,,"Vrana is an offensive-minded winger looking to make a difference on the scoreboard
each and every game. He is a pretty good skater, showing an outstanding burst of speed with the puck
through the neutral zone and into the offensive zone. Shifty and hard to contain as he is just as quick
laterally as he is going forward. Vrana does a good job creating offense away from the puck, utilizing
his ability to slink around and get into open position for scoring chances. Grade-A shot, especially
the velocity, but accuracy is also good. He has a good backhander, too. However, there's aspects to
work on in this department. Sometimes he seems to hesitate when given a good shooting opportunity. Also, he needs to improve his one-timer consistency. He's also inconsistent when it comes to
passing. Some days he's really good at it, other days he just can't fnd an open lane. Vrana can
make hard, accurate passes both in the neutral zone and in the offensive zone. His attitude to
the defensive game was fne as he supported the defensemen pretty well. Good forechecker,
too. Physically, he is not afraid to go to the gritty areas and pay a price for a scoring opportunity. Vrana thrives in a go-to role for his team, but he needs to realize hockey is a team game. Again, Vrana's consistency in effort levels wanes from contest to contest
and shift to shift. He looks downright lazy in some contests. He gets stripped of the puck
too often. Vrana can be prone to turnovers when he tries to do too much on his own, engaging multiple defenders and trying to beat them to the net with one-on-one dekes and
jukes. Needs to read the situations better and realize he cannot do it alone; he will need
to learn to utilize his teammates better with give and goes, cycles in the offensive zone
and just short, quick passes. Defensively, he shows very little interest in that aspect
of the game, only half-heartedly coming back and remaining in the general vicinity of
his check. He reacts late in the defensive zone too often. Can get frustrated easily
and that really knocks him off his game. He needs to mature in his understanding
of the game and his role in it."
2014,D,70.75,180,14,DAL,,Julius Honka,"Honka hit the ground running in his first season in North America, looking substantially better as a prospect than when he played in Europe. The factor that's really elevated his play has been his improvement defensively, which has allowed him to be leaned on more in tough minutes (and will be pivotal to his having a big role in the NHL). His physical game remains a major liability, as he's small (5-11, 174 pounds), not that strong, and not an intimidating guy when contact is initiated. Overall, he can play a risky style of game, but most of the time he doesn't get caught and knows how to make the most of his offensive gifts without giving up too much on the back end.",,,,,,,"A small puck-moving defenseman, Honka has a strong stride with
very good feet. Agility is top-notch. An elusive defenseman who slips between forecheckers
with ease. Excellent passer who is always able to connect the dots. PP quarterback, managing
and distributing the puck at the point well. Excellent at transitioning the puck out of his zone.
His best defense is offense as he doesn't possess any real strong defensive attributes. Uses
his anticipation and quick stick to grab loose pucks and quickly get it up to his forwards. Really
do not like how he defends his own zone for the most part. He knows he isn't a big guy and his
physical game shows it as he does not throw many checks. Doesn't fght for space in the corners or in front of the net often either. We defnitely would've liked to see some more intensity
and body play incorporated into his game. Not going to be able to play this way at the NHL level.
His hockey sense is very good as he reads plays very well and has patience and poise, but his
defensive intensity and willingness to battle is not up to snuff. Has the talent to become a game
breaker but it comes with a lot of risk."
2014,C,72.75,190,15,DET,,Dylan Larkin,"Larkin is one of the top power forwards available in this year's draft class, and is an outstanding skater, one of the best in the class. He has a fine but not outstanding amount of skill, but gains the offensive zone very often due to his skating ability. Larkin has average size (6-0, 192 pounds), but he's pretty strong on the puck and has a fantastic on-ice work ethic. He drives the net, muscles out opponents in battles and gets back on defense effectively. He kills penalties well and he can be a shorthanded scoring threat. Another plus: Larkin plays both wing and center effectively. He's committed to the University of Michigan for the 2014-15 season.",,,,,,,"Larkin is a strong, powerful, two-way forward with a high complete level. He is an
absolute rocket in his skates and one of the top skaters in this draft. He reaches his top speed very
quickly and he gets end to end in seconds. He has great lateral mobility and top-end agility. He uses
his quickness to elude opposing defensemen. Larkin is a high-end possession player with excellent
strength on the puck and great balance on his edges to take the puck wide and muscle his way to
the net. He isn't huge, but he is very strong and hard to knock off the puck. He is not overly fashy,
but is highly effective, quick and deceptive with the puck. Larkin is a highly intelligent player with
and without the puck. He makes decisions with the puck, typically the correct ones, almost immediately, and he seems to know what he is doing before he receives a pass. He handles and deals
out passes very well. He is a quick, effcient puck-mover with the ability to set up teammates and
make plays happen. Larkin has a very good shot with a great release. It isn't just the quickness
of his release that's impressive, but it is the deception. He will make you think pass, and you'll
be wrong. He has a very good wrist-shot with a good release and he gets into very good scoring positions. He does seem to be a pass-frst player, though. Larkin's effort never wanes
and he gives his best each shift. He is a high-compete, high-intelligence, three-zone center.
He doesn't destroy players with his big, physical hits, but he does a great job riding guys
off the puck and outmuscling players to win possession. He battles and competes hard
for the puck. His defensive effort is just as good as his effort with the puck. He is smart
and gets into great supporting areas, and he does a great job adjusting to the position
and decisions of his linemates. He backchecks hard and gets into good areas to help
on defense. He supports well down low and impedes with a quick, active stick and
aggressive playing style. The biggest knock on Larkin is his limited projected offensive
upside. While he does project to be a strong NHL player, it will be in a two-way
role that he will make his money, not as a prime offensive point producer. A David
Legwand or poor man's Ryan Kesler type of pro upside is the projection for Larkin
and one has to wonder if this limitation will cause his stock to drop marginally"
2014,LW,71.5,183,16,CBJ,,Sonny Milano,"Milano put up giant scoring numbers with the USNTDP compared to even what most top forwards have done in the past. Some of it was due to playing on a line with elite 2015 draft prospect Jack Eichel, but he was not a passenger on that train. When you watch Milano, ""soft hands"" and ""offensive instincts"" are the things that stand out immediately, and what I heard scouts say about him. His puck skills and offensive hockey sense are among the best in the draft. He's not selfish with the puck, as he sees the ice and distributes at a high level. Milano is also a good if not an excellent skater with high-end acceleration. His defense is not amazing, but he's improved significantly in that area, even taking on some PK duty for the NTDP. His most notable weaknesses are his size (5-11, 185 pounds) and strength, and he can turn the puck over a little too much with his flashy plays. He is committed to Boston College for the 2014-15 season.",,,,,,,"Milano is a quick-footed forward with great quickness and agility, and the ability to beat
players with fashes of quickness down the wing. He possesses good top speed and the ability to beat
guys with fashy moves as he goes end to end with the puck. His hand speed and hand skills are impressive. He has a plethora of tricks up his sleeves and his creativity seems to have no end. Milano
is very confdent and has a high IQ with the puck, and is a very intelligent passer. While goal-scoring
may be his eventual forte, his ability to create chances for his teammates and be a playmaker, as
well as a goal scorer, is also very impressive. He is a very quick decision maker and he seems to
know where his options are before he receives the puck. He makes a good touch pass, and he
has the ability to get the puck in the air to reach a target. His ability on his backhand is probably
his most impressive skill that draws his handiness out of the crowd of skill puck handlers in this
draft. He has an incredible backhand shot with great accuracy and power. He also has a good
wrist shot with great quickness and accuracy, and he knows how to pick the corners. He is a
dual threat with the puck. Milano isn't the toughest player, but he also doesn't lack heart and
a competitive edge. He competes hard for pucks and is involved in puck battles as he fghts
for possession on the boards. Milano is a highly skilled winger with a good compete level
and urgency when he has or is around the puck. He is a highly intelligent, quick-thinking
forward. He makes the smart move and fnds his options quickly. Milano can be lazy in his backchecking responsibilities and can get
caught leaving the zone way too early on many of his team's breakouts. Offensively,
there are not many prospects who can match his creativity and effectiveness at creating chances for himself and his linemates, but if you are looking for someone who
works as hard to keep the puck out of his own net as he does to put it in the opposition's you are looking at the wrong prospect. With that said, there have been a few
games where we see Milano coming back hard and helping to clear his zone, we
just haven't seen it consistently. He will need to become more consistent in his
defensive effort and show a willingness to get involved. "
2014,D,75,181,17,PHI,,Travis Sanheim,"Sanheim wasn't on the radar as a top-100 prospect early in the season, but he really picked up his play in the second half and elevated himself into the conversation. He has effective size (6-3, 181 pounds) and offensive skill, and his puck-moving ability increased as the season progressed. Sanheim has very good mobility with an effortless, powerful stride and the evasiveness you don't typically see with a player his size. His speed allows him to be a threat leading the rush. He isn't an overly physical player, but with his reach and IQ he's able to be strong defensively and makes a fair number of stops.",,,,,,,"A big, two-way defenseman. Pretty solid skater, but when his legs
get chugging, he can look a little lanky and clumsy. When he is in top gear, he moves pretty
smoothly and somehow fnds a way to maneuver around guys. Doesn't always look pretty, but
he gets the job done. In his own zone, he maintains a pretty strong position while doing a good
job boxing out opponents. Rubs guys out and uses his frame to control ice, but by no means is
he a bruiser and we don't think he ever will be. Can get a little out of position chasing the puck
around in the neutral and offensive zones. Would like to see him settle down a bit and limit the
number of times he pinches and tries to step up on offensive chances. A good, accurate passer,
but at times struggles with pucks in his feet and getting it off under pressure. Has an accurate
shot as well, but lacks high-end velocity and his release isn't the quickest. Picks good spots to
shoot and pass while on the power play. Hockey sense is pretty good, making nice reads while
mixing patience with up-tempo puck movement. Does a good job of recognizing the oncoming
forecheck and carrying the puck into the zone if given the space to do so. Sanheim is a good
all-round player. Has a lot of upside as a big defenseman who can play in any role."
2014,RW,75.5,213,18,MIN,,Alex Tuch,"Tuch really elevated his game as a prospect this season, improving significantly in several areas while playing on the top line for the NTDP alongside Eichel and Milano. He's a giant at 6-4, 215 pounds, with a lot of skill. He's highly creative, and is at his best from the hashmarks in. Tuch protects the puck quite well and can be very effective in the cycle. He won't bulldoze guys, but is pretty physical and due to his size/strength wins a lot of battles. Tuch's skating has gotten better, but still has room for improvement. He also needs to improve his defensive positioning and awareness.",,,,,,,"A big-body power winger who can score. Tuch moves well for a 6-foot-4, 215-pound
winger. He has strong straight-line speed and acceleration and he is very balanced on his skates. Tuch
also shows off the ability to distribute the puck off the rush, using his awareness for his teammates to
make strong drop passes and cross-ice feeds. Tuch gives a very strong effort, competing hard in all
zones and using his size and strength to make himself an imposing force in the offensive zone. He
is very tough to compete against for defenses, including the big guys in both the USHL and college
games. Tuch's strength makes him a force with the puck down low and when powering his way by
defenders toward the net. He protects the puck well with his size and makes himself nearly impossible to separate from it. Shows a willingness to get mean and throw his weight around on the
forecheck. He gives a good board effort, as he uses his intimidating size to beat players in the
corners and win puck possession. Tuch is also strong on defense. He is always one of the frst
back in the play, and uses his reach and his stick to interfere with the opposition's offensive
chances. He does an excellent job taking away lanes and he pressures the points very well,
not giving much room to shooters at the point. He knows when he should get involved lower
in the zone and when to stay high covering the points. He uses his strength to tie players
up and help out on the boards. Tuch is a very well-rounded big man. With all the impressive aspects of Tuch's game, there are also areas
that leave something to be desired. For all the power and impressive size Tuch possesses, he had the tendency to become invisible and look disinterested in the play at times
this season. He lacks consistency in his effort. Tuch also doesn't have the greatest
set of hands; he lacks creativity, and relies on shorter feeds, fnding nearby linemates
before he goes to the net or battles for space. Relies on those around him to handle the puck and be the creative playmakers on his line. A complementary player,
but one who does a great job utilizing his strengths. Tuch possesses a shot with
some good power and a decent release, though there are times where he should
get it off quicker. The majority of Tuch's chances do come from the goal mouth,
though, as he uses his strength to gain position and make things happen. He
will need to work on his attack off the rush."
2014,D,70.5,175,19,TBL,,Tony DeAngelo,"DeAngelo is one of the toughest prospects to get a read on in this year's class. His numbers as a 17- and 18-year-old in the OHL have been outstanding, but there are notable question marks on his game from a scouting standpoint. I've heard his skating described by scouts as anywhere from good to great, with my observations leaning to the latter. He can play with pace, and makes creative plays. DeAngelo is not the biggest guy -- at 5-11, 168 pounds -- and while he competes on the ice, he tends to lose his fair share of battles. He has a long way to go defensively. On top of his flaws in the physical game, he often gets beat by skilled players and really needs to work on his angles/positioning. He can also be too risky with the puck, turning it over more than he should.",,,,,,,"DeAngelo is the prototypical puck-moving, elite offensive defenseman. The strongest
area of his game has to be his skating ability as he's one of the best skaters not only of this draft class,
but also in the entire CHL. He has incredible edge work that makes his transitioning nearly fawless.
Explosive acceleration and frst-step quickness. DeAngelo is able to join and lead the rush up ice,
as well as be the frst defender back with his recovery speed. Possesses great stick-handling ability
and vision. DeAngelo's creative with the puck, makes sharp, precise passes to teammates, likes
to carry the puck on the breakout and is confdent with his shooting ability to let shots go through
traffc. Gets his nose dirty every game as he wants to play physical and is willing to not only play
the body, but to hack and whack his way into his opponent's bad books. He will drop the gloves
and lay the body with limited success. Has an extremely high hockey IQ, impressive positioning
and intuitiveness. DeAngelo shows fashes of leadership, but needs to mature a lot to be considered a true leader. Oh, where to start. With all the talent this kid possesses, there are some
considerable warts that might have taken him off a few draft lists altogether. DeAngelo is
emotional. Easily taken off his game as he melts down when the opposition gets under
his skin. He is not a good team player. While he does enjoy team success, he is quick to
place blame for failure on his teammates by verbally scolding them or displaying poor
body language. This arrogance is surely a maturity issue that the NHL team selecting
him will look to get a handle on quickly. With regard to his size and lack of strength, he
is going to need to add some considerable muscle to his legs and upper body to become more effective defending. While he does not lack a physical edge to his game,
its effectiveness is nowhere near an asset. He makes plays and pinches that are
gambles and neglects his defensive responsibility multiple times a game, partly due
to still learning what he can and cannot get away with and partly as a “give me the
damn puck and I will do it all” arrogance."
2014,C,71.5,172,20,CHI,,Nick Schmaltz,"Schmaltz has been a top scorer in the USHL for the past two seasons, and is the younger brother of St. Louis Blues prospect Jordan Schmaltz. Nick's puck skills and pure creativity allow him to make a lot of defenders miss, and create scoring chances at times when it doesn't look like there is an opportunity. Schmaltz has pretty good possession skills as well. ""He can own the puck during a game,"" said one NHL scout. Schmaltz isn't the biggest guy in the class (6-0, 172 pounds), so he needs to bulk up, and play less bashfully in battles. High risk, high reward is the school of thought among NHL scouts with Schmaltz. He is committed to North Dakota for the 2014-15 season.",,,,,,,"One of the biggest enigmas in the draft, highly skilled Nick Schmaltz
has the talent to be one of the highest picks in the draft, but his consistency, attitude and inability
to perform in the playoffs for Green Bay will force him to fall. Schmaltz is an explosive skater,
who at times will appear to be going at 0 MPH, and then all of a sudden, he'll dart up the ice
and get into loose space. He has quick feet and strong acceleration both with and without the
puck. Schmaltz is a highly creative, highly skilled winger with very good stick skills and several
handfuls of nifty tricks to use with the puck on his stick to make opposing players look silly. He
has great awareness with the puck, and sees the ice and play very well. He is able to locate
even the slightest of passing lanes and he can create scoring chances out of seemingly nothing.
He is a great playmaker and passer, who also has the ability to fnish. He is elusive without the
puck and has the ability to sneak into open space around the net like an unseen ghost. He is
an effective backdoor fnisher, and he also has a hard, quick wrist shot that he'll get into good
position to take. Schmaltz lacks consistency in every part of the game, but most notably his willingness to crash and bang for the puck, or get back and help out defensively. He tends to ignore
the physical aspect of the game and at times will just seem unwilling to get engaged in the play
on the ice. He lacks care and awareness in his own end and needs to improve his attitude and
overall effort if he is going to be an NHLer."
2014,C,70.25,170,21,STL,,Robby Fabbri,"Fabbri put up a lot of points on a very gifted OHL team, but then again, he was a big part of why they scored so many goals. Fabbri is an above-average skater who has good natural speed, but with his great work ethic he's a player who jets up and down the ice. Fabbri gets on defensemen quickly, and his skating makes him a dangerous short-handed goal threat on the penalty kill. Fabbri sees his options well, understands where to be and what plays to make to generate scoring chances. He's got an accurate shot, although it could use more zip. He's not the biggest guy (5-10, 166 pounds), and that's his biggest weakness, if not his only real notable issue. Fabbri does battle really well, however, and will initiate contact, which is an element you want to see in the smaller players.",,,,,,,"A small, but feisty, two-way goal scorer. Fabbri is extremely fast, and sees the ice
very well. He anticipates plays and uses his small size to squeeze through holes or around opponents
into open areas to give his teammates a passing option. He battles hard and is more than willing to
grind it out in the corners and more often than not, comes away with the puck. He jumps on loose
pucks and uses his speed to separate himself from opponents in a foot race. Fabbri has tremendous
hand speed with the puck and has fashes of creativity, deking defenders one on one. He has the
ability to get out of tight quarters under pressure. At top speed, he maintains control of the puck
and makes excellent passes. Plays with pace. Fabbri uses his limited size and shifty feet as an
asset as he dodges checks to continue with the puck. He is not afraid to take a hit and accepts
them regularly to make a play. He has tremendous vision and can see passing lanes across the
ice through a swarm of legs and players' sticks. Fabbri makes hard and accurate passes. He
plays his part well in the defensive zone and offers support to the defenders, often helping to
lead the breakout. He is not bothered by pressure and shows a lot of patience with the puck.
He is a high-possession player with a pass-frst mentality, but will often unleash a hard shot
when he has the chance. Fabbri has a nose to get to the net and great hockey sense, often
recognizing opportunities before his linemates do. Once he has the puck, he is very strong
and doesn't let it go. He protects the puck extremely well using his strength and has the
wiry upper body strength to extend his reach on the puck with one hand if need be. He is
a shifty skater and has a ton of mobility. Add that to his overall speed and hockey sense,
and Fabbri can change the pace and outcome of the game when he steps on the ice. The biggest negative is the obvious size and strength issue Fabbri faces, not that it matters to him and how he plays the game. It does not matter
if he is 5-foot-10 and 165 pounds soaking wet if he proves himself by scoring a
goal a game at this level. Some NHL teams who value (or overvalue) size will not
even look at this prospect until their second or third pick. It does not matter that
he shows a feisty, never-give-up battle level in his game. His size scares these
teams as just one hard, square check could knock him out of the game for good.
Fabbri also shows a bit of an undisciplined side that will hopefully improve
with time and maturity. He has laid some borderline dirty hits and made some
questionable decisions that have cost him and his team on the ice. On a few
occasions during games, he gets caught cheating his way out of the zone,
which can cost him at higher levels of play."
2014,RW,72,181,22,PIT,,Kasperi Kapanen,"The son of longtime NHLer Sami Kapanen is a dynamic offensive player. He was a top player at the under-18 championships as an under-age level player, and would have played a top-six role for Finland at the WJC had he not been injured. His production in Finland's top league was not great, but keep in mind that his team was historically bad this season. Kapanen is a very good skater with a blistering first few steps and an above-average top gear. He sees the ice at a high-end level, and regularly makes all kinds of impressive passes. His ability to generate through his own skills and to set up others is what puts him here. Kapanen also has a good shot, and works hard in battles. He needs to work on his defense, and is undersized (6-0, 181 pounds) but is pretty strong.",,,,,,,"Kapanen possesses one of the better two-way games in the draft. He has dynamic
puck skills, terrifc skating ability and hockey sense. He's the total package on offense. Kapanen displays an explosive skating stride, quick off the hop. Very agile and quick laterally. He is a fantastic skater, with a seemingly effortless stride that generates healthy levels of speed. Lulls opponents to sleep
with a pedestrian-looking stride before he explodes into a full-on rush toward the net or loose puck.
He skates very well with the puck, has good hands and skates with his head up, looking for passing options. He also does not shy away from the physical side of the game. Possesses a creative
mind. Kapanen sees the ice well and appears to have a great IQ for the game. He distributes the
puck effectively and is able to set up his teammates in a variety of ways. Very good playmaking
ability, and he also has a sharp shot and the ability to sneak into deadly scoring areas. Kapanen is very elusive on offense, using his lateral shiftiness and soft hands, and he is also very
competitive when it comes to pursuing the puck. He loves to play the body on the forecheck.
Has impeccable offensive senses and a shot to complement. His accuracy and release are
impressive. Kapanen's one-timer can burn a team in a fash. Kapanen's consistency in his effort level is our main concern, even
more than his lack of strength. Kapanen's competitive edge takes a bit of a dive when he
reaches his own end, and he can improve his defensive effort and awareness. There are
times he looks like a dominant two-way guy, but you know where his heart lies--creating
offensive chances. He will also go through self-evoked slumps in when the physical
game gets ramped up as he does not mind hitting, but does not like to be hit. That
point leads us to his size, or lack thereof. He can get outmuscled pretty easily by average-sized opponents along the wall and loses his effectiveness in grittier matches
because of this."
2014,C,70.25,192,23,COL,,Conner Bleackley,"Bleackley trended up this season in a significant way, and developed into a legitimate two-way forward for Red Deer. He logged big minutes in all situations, which is the kind of player he projects to being as a pro. He's a very hard-working forward who ""competes so hard in every area of the ice, every shift,"" per one scout. Bleackley kills penalties effectively, and anticipates the flow of the offensive pressure well. He's also a very astute thinker on the offensive side of the puck. Bleackley has a fine strength level right now, but certainly has more room to grow on that front. His skating is decent, however.",,,,,,,"A strong two-way center, Bleackley contributes to his team's success at both ends
of the ice. Bleackley is a good skater. He has good agility and strength, and wins puck races. He is a
pretty stalky kid, but his quick movements are very impressive. Has some solid on-ice sense. He is
a very fast thinker and when he gets the puck under pressure, he can react in a blink to protect the
puck from danger and work through a check. Bleackley's quick-thinking skills also come in handy in
his own zone, where he fows with the play almost perfectly and manages the breakout. Bleackley
uses his size to his physical advantage. His board play is absolutely phenomenal. He dominates
along the wall. Bleackley has a very strong lower body that allows him to push through checks.
Bleackley shows an instinct for being in correct scoring positions. He will fght through traffc to
get to the net and has a big shot with a quick little release. Displays good ability to beat opposing players one on one in the offensive zone, leading to quality scoring chances. He can silk a
few nice passes around the offensive zone as well, and had no trouble handling the puck and
making proper plays around the net. He is just a true warrior who is willing to go to the ends
of the Earth to win every battle on the ice. He's a soldier. Every time he stepped on the ice,
he knew his role and just got the job done. He will go to war in the corners every shift and
he wins a lot more battles than he losses. Bleackley is responsible in his own zone. His
long reach and big body disrupt shooting and passing lanes. He consistently made simple
plays to get the puck out of his own zone. Being captain of Red Deer at 17 years of age
speaks to the trust his coaches have in him and his maturity to lead. While Bleackley is a strong two-way player, he is not as effective
offensively as he could be because he doesn't have the explosiveness or second
gear to break away from the pack in the neutral zone or when he has the puck in the
offensive zone. He is at his best when playing a hard-working, north-south game,
but he has times when he gets away from what he is best at and can overthink a
play leading to a turnover. Like all kids his age, he has also had some consistency
issues as he looks dominant one game and hardly effective the next. His emotion
can also get the best of him at times, especially playing on a bottom dweller and
he can take the odd, ill-advised frustration penalty."
2014,C,70.25,179,24,VAN,,Jared McCann,"McCann is a gifted all-around player, and has a strong hockey IQ. His hockey sense translates to plus creativity, vision, positioning and defensive awareness. He regularly lined up against the opponents' best players in tough even-strength minutes, and was effective in doing so. He's an above-average stick handler who won't try to be a hero, but can make tough plays to evade pressure and create chances. He'll also pull off the occasional highlight-reel play. His best offensive asset in the attacking zone is his shot. He's got a bullet, and can score from a distance -- and at times, overshoot. McCann certainly needs to get stronger, and despite a good physical work ethic he projects as a below-average physical player at the top level.",,,,,,,"McCann is a very smart player with a good work ethic and great offensive instincts. He
has a great frst step that catches d-men off balance. Has the ability to go from zero to full speed in just
a couple strides. McCann has good agility and is strong on his skates. He has solid hands to protect
and control the puck in traffc. McCann has a deadly accurate shot with one of the quickest releases
in this draft class. He gets himself into high-percentage scoring areas in the offensive zone. He has
great vision and displays impressive passing skills nightly. His ability to fnd open teammates in
traffc is uncanny. A natural playmaker. He battles hard for pucks and shows a willingness to go to
dirty areas to create scoring chances. McCann not only is a skilled individual, but he also makes
his teammates better, and brings out the best in their games with his impressive communication,
vision and passing ability. While not a natural instinct, he plays physical when the chance presents itself and he thrives under the pressure of playing against the opposition's top players. He
works well along the boards, which allows him to make plays in the offensive zone. When in
the offensive zone, he is consistently able to get to scoring areas and maintain position using
his strength. He is rarely out of position. McCann has great instincts and hockey smarts. He
sees the play develop far sooner than his counterparts. Has exceptional puck control, which
he uses to create space for himself and his teammates. His versatility and ability to play
both ends of the rink is impressive. He plays a real smart two-way game. McCann does
all the little things well. He leads by example and has a high compete level. Not only is he
still able to be an offensive threat for the Hounds, but McCann is taking care of business
in his own end, and has been very impressive causing havoc on the forecheck. He's
often matched up against the opposition's best offensive players, and he has thrived
in that role. He shows he is willing to get into shooting lanes and block shots. He
actively uses his stick to defect pucks. McCann takes his defensive responsibilities
just as seriously as his play in the offensive end. McCann takes a lot of punishment from the opposition, and
this affected on his overall performance this season. The many hacks and hooks,
whacks and slashes, holding and after-whistle shoving from the frustration of
his opponents took its toll on the even-keeled McCann and slowed down his
game, grinding down his effectiveness over certain points of the season. His
durability and need to add considerable strength are concerns that will need
to be addressed this summer for his game to take that next step. Not a true
weakness per se, but McCann does not have the fashy offensive skills
teams will be looking for in a top selection."
2014,RW,72,167,25,BOS,,David Pastranak,"Pastrnak had one of the most productive seasons in the lower Swedish league for an under-18 forward in decades, despite a late back injury that kept him out of the under-18 championships. His 24 points in 36 games surpassed Filip Forsberg's 17 points when the Nashville Predators prospect was in this situation. Pastrnak is a smooth, coordinated puck handler who can make the tough evasive moves on a frequent basis. His hockey IQ is really high, as he sees all his options, processes the game very quickly and understands how to play with pace. He's a good skater with shiftiness and an above-average top gear, who also possesses a quick release on his shot. Pastrnak's main weakness is his physical game, as he loses a fair amount of battles.",,,,,,,"Pastrnak is a fashy, creative offensive talent who is dangerous every time he touches
the puck. His game is a lot about handling the puck at high speed. He's a very quick and agile skater,
with a peculiar skating style, balancing far forward on his blade which gives him a great jump to his
stride. Uses his lateral agility to elude checks and hits as he enters and circles the offensive zone. He
loves to collect some speed in the neutral zone and challenge his defender one on one. Pastrnak
is not an overly fashy stickhandler, but he handles the puck well at all times and has a very good
success rate on his attempts to carry the puck into the offensive zone. On the power play, he plays
the left circle, passes the puck quite well and is constantly looking for the one-timer. His shot is
lethal; it's super hard and super accurate, and what's amazing about it is that he doesn't need
too much space or time to release it. You just give him a second and a couple of inches, and
he can blast one top corner. He's got really smooth hands and, combined with great vision, it
makes him a great passer as well. But the shot is even a notch better than his passing. He's
not easily knocked off the puck. He uses his speed to separate himself from the opponents
and drive to the net. Pastrnak didn't get much done in his own zone, as his defensive game
has a way to go. There were games where he played well in his own zone, taking away
chances, and then other games where he looked somewhat lost. He seems to have a
decent understanding of how to position himself in all zones, and while he might stay a
little high looking for a breakaway, he is still a pretty hard-working player overall. Physically, there is not much to his game to write about. He does not like to get hit and rarely
throws a big check of his own. He makes mistakes with the puck, i.e. bad passes or
giveaways, that he will need to reduce."
2014,RW,73,175,26,MON,,Nikita Scherbak,"Scherbak was a huge riser this season. He was a relative unknown on the draft radar in the summer, but had a huge 18-year-old rookie season in the WHL. He's a really interesting player because he has so many tools and the character to keep improving and learning about the North American game. His vision creates a lot, but he just understands where to go, what to do, and how to make all the right plays at a high speed to create offense. ""His sense of timing is great,"" said one scout. His stride is pretty clean and can show a good bursts of speed, although I'm not sure he's a blazer. I think with improved strength, his skating has notable room to grow and excel. His defense isn't the best, but it isn't a major issue.",,,,,,,"Scherbak is a big winger who plays with a lot of skill and power. He is
hunched over when he skates, but moves very well. Has a quick frst step that allows him to attack small creases in the defense, but his overall acceleration and explosiveness have room to
improve. Very elusive and agile for a player his size. His hands are a major strength in his game
as he always fnds a way to maneuver in traffc while surveying his options to attack. Scherbak
shows a high aptitude for fnding open teammates while being pressured by defenders. Good,
hard wrist shot that always seems to force the goalie to make a tough save, and his even balance of shot/pass plays keeps the opposition guessing. Very strong on his feet, although he
was rarely the aggressor in the dirty areas. Scherbak spends a little bit too much time drifting
in the neutral zone when he could assert himself at a better position on the breakout and in the
defensive zone. His eyes seem to light up around the puck, but we would have liked to seen a
little bit more competitiveness away from the play to help his team succeed. Concerns about
some of his neutral- and defensive-zone tendencies, and the occasional careless turnover, are
valid, but there is no denying his talent."
2014,LW,71.75,178,27,SJS,,Nikolay Goldobin,"Goldobin was one of the top scorers in the OHL in his second season in the league; his pure offensive skill package is outstanding, one of the best in the class. He's a gifted playmaker, which allows him to be the primary creator on the power play from the side wall. Goldobin sees his options quickly, and delivers all his passes on the tape even if he has to elevate the puck. He projects as a fantastic power-play asset at the NHL level. At the risk of furthering a stereotype about Russian forwards, Goldobin's main issues are off the puck. He needs to win more battles, gain strength and improve his defense.",,,,,,,"Goldobin is a feet-footed offensive forward who boasts one hell of an offensive skill
set. He also possesses a very smooth skating stride and a quick frst step, which makes him extremely
dangerous. He is shifty and really hard to pin down for defenses. He gets into solid position in the
offensive zone to capitalize on scoring chances. Goldobin has exceptional vision, creates plays,
and can beat defenders by using his combination of speed and elite-level hands. Because of his
elite playmaking ability, he makes his linemates that much better when he's out on the ice. He hits
teammates with dishes even if they are not in his feld of vision. He is the king of the no-look pass.
Goldobin possesses some of the smoothest stick-handling skills we've seen at this level in a long
time. He routinely makes defenders look silly with his quick hands and moves. He has a relatively
hard, accurate wrist shot that he uses to fool goaltenders. He shoots from all different angles in
the offensive zone. His one-timer is automatic and already pro caliber. Goldobin's quick release
is one of his best assets. The only thing lacking in Goldobin's game is a distinct effort when the
puck is in the defensive zone. When his defensive effort level is off, he seems disinterested
all around and it shows in his offensive performance as well. He obviously has the talent
and skill set to be a real blue-chip prospect, but he just didn't have the effort or drive
needed to fulfll his promise. Virtually invisible on the ice until an offensive chance sparks
his interest and then he can become unstoppable. Not the most physically intimidating
player. When Goldobin works hard along the boards and isn't afraid to chase pucks
into the corner on dump-ins, he is still rarely effective due to his timid nature and lack
of functional strength. "
2014,RW,71,175,28,NYI,,Josh Ho-Sang,"Ho-Sang is one of the toughest players to evaluate in this draft. On raw talent, he's a clear top-10 prospect and maybe even in the top five. Scouts can't praise his skill level enough. He's one of the best skaters in the draft; his first few steps and overall stride are high end, and his top speed is elite. Ho-Sang is also a high-end if not better puck handler. This combination allows him to be a dynamic player who can create scoring chances out of nothing. However, Ho-Sang can struggle at times with his decision making with the puck, frequently turning it over or trying to do too much. Off the puck, he's a work in progress. He has top-line tools, but more risk than the rest of the top tier of prospects.",,,,,,,"Ho-Sang is a speedy, high-end, offensive forward with elite hands and unlimited offensive upside. He has some of the top individual skills in this draft class. His skating is extremely
dynamic, moving side to side very quickly, impressive straight-line speed and the ability to cut through
traffc at a high rate of speed. He sends defenders to the infrmary with sprained ankles regularly with
his quick one-on-one movements and devastating fakes. Ho-Sang uses smarts and his impressive
vision to attack defenders one on one in zone entry and when driving toward the net. He is ultra-creative with the puck, and can turn routine plays into highlight-reel plays in an instant. Ho-Sang is a
power play specialist with the ability to quarterback the offense from the half wall with his playmaking ability. He uses his creativity and patience to cycle the puck around the offensive zone.
He is very poised for such a young individual. Ho-Sang doesn't look like a second-year player
when you see him on the ice; you would assume that he is a veteran. He dictates the play, and
teammates look for him to start the breakouts. He has the hockey sense to allow him to be in
the right spot at the right times. His playmaking and vision are two of his strongest qualities.
Ho-Sang fnds open players with direct, crisp passes. He possesses a strong, accurate shot
with a quick release, and he has the ability to fool goaltenders. While Ho-Sang has the potential to be an elite offensive talent, his
game does have some holes in it. He needs to work on decision making, not trying to
make the fancy play all the time, simplifying his game, and working on his defensive
game and defensive effort to round himself out more. He was improving all these facets
of his game over the last couple months of the year, but still has a way to go. Also, getting bigger and stronger will help him with battling in the corners and around the net
area, which he often shied away from during his frst two Major Junior seasons. He
often had opportunities when he could've taken a quality shot for a scoring chance,
but passed up the shot to try to make the play that much more fancy. That rarely
works out for the best and he will need to continue to take what is there to grow
his game. Despite being poised with the puck, he does lack some maturity, both
on and off the ice, and he loves the attention. NHL teams might have a problem
with that."
2014,C,73.5,187,29,LAK,,Adrien Kempe,"Kempe is a great power winger who showed flashes in the SHL this season on top of quality under-18 showings. He's one of the better skaters available, with the first-few-step acceleration and overall top gear to simply fly through the neutral zone and pressure defenders. When you combine Kempe's speed with a strong frame and a willingness to attack the net, he becomes a dangerous physical threat. His hand-eye coordination allows him to control the puck well and be dangerous getting his stick on pucks in front of the net. Kempe can play center somewhat effectively, in addition to his natural wing slot. He needs to improve his pace and reads, as he can get a little lost in the play at times.",,,,,,,"Kempe is a strong, two-way forward who brings to the table an impressive balance
between skill and physicality. He's got both and uses both properly. He is a very fast skater and has
quick acceleration. Kempe is a smooth, powerful-looking skater who gains power and speed coming
down the wing. He has excellent size and strength, and is very strong on the puck. I was really impressed with the way Kempe used his speed to escape players and take the puck down the outside,
and then use his body to protect the puck effectively from defenders. Kempe is smart with the puck
and sees the ice well. He displayed decent hand speed and creativity. He distributes it into open
seams, and is a quick thinker with the puck. He makes a crisp, effective pass and locates holes in
the opposing defense quickly. Kempe also has a quick, hard wrist shot that he'll use coming off
the wing. He works hard on the walls and competes endlessly for the puck. Kempe uses his size
nicely to battle for pucks and doesn't seem to mind the physical game. He is solid defensively,
getting back into the play quickly and working to take chances from the point men. Kempe
gets into post-whistle altercations, especially if provoked and during emotional games. Outstanding penalty killer. Knows how to force a turnover. Kempe's a leader and a real handful
to deal with. Hits everything in sight and happily initiates contact. Not one you look forward
to seeing in the corners if you are a defenseman. He is tenacious on the penalty kill, using
his stick and smarts to close off options. He gets his frame in front of shots and in lanes
defensively to disrupt the opposition. Kempe does not possess high-end creativity or elite offensive vision that would make you think he will be a big point producer at the NHL level. While
he can both score and set up a play for a teammate, he needs to work on both his
shot and passing skills as both can be hit or miss (pun intended). Seen by most as a
very effective complementary player and not a frst-line contributor at the next level.
Should work on discipline and skating away from altercations. Can put his team
down a man when he lets his emotions get the best of him."
2014,C,72.5,182,30,NJD,,John Quennville,"He is strong in puck possession, can make quick decisions with the puck, and works hard to get to the net and win battles. Scouts describe him as a very dangerous player from the hashmarks in. John's skating needs some work, as his first few steps aren't the best. He's improved a fair amount defensively and has become a fine penalty killer.",,,,,,," Quenneville is a big-bodied forward with strong shoulders. He is not
the fastest skater in the league, but he defnitely has some good quickness in tight to go along
with a technically sound stride. Flipped between center and the wing this season, but overall,
we liked his defensive commitment and positioning in both roles. Shows some solid backcheck
pressure and is physically involved in the corners. Shows very good work along the walls using
his strength and hockey sense. Always seems to end up on the winning end of puck battles and
cycle confrontations. His cycle work is very strong, using a combination of his feet and good
puck skills to maintain possession while looking for options. Shows a good, hard shot, and
pretty good release with solid velocity and accuracy. We would like to see a little more offensive
creativity. A pro-style forward who has a physical element to his game, a good shot, and who
works hard in all three zones."

Lemieux is an above-average skater, although I've gotten mixed reviews from scouts on that area of his game. Some scouts I've talked to note they aren't crazy about his skating, but every time I've seen him he's looked impressive in that area. Lemieux has good balance and is effective protecting the puck. He isn't an overly skilled player, but he's decent offensively with good instincts. On his best shifts, his hockey IQ shines through, but Lemieux needs to work on reigning in his emotions and not taking bad penalties, which he does often. The apple didn't fall far from the tree on that front. He has the ability to be a scoring, physical winger if he pans out.",,,,,,," Lemieux is a solid skater, but it takes him a few strides to get up to
speed. He works hard and what he lacks in speed, he makes up for in size and determination.
He has the ability to pull away from players when in possession of the puck and is very agile.
He pivots well, and is powerful in stops and starts. He dishes accurate, crisp passes and has
good hands. He controls the puck with ease and the timing of his passes are near perfect. Has
a very effective shot that he can get off in tight spaces. He uses his size to protect the puck well,
and does not back down from a fght. He is a hard-nosed player who fnds a way to always get
to the net. Maturity is almost there but, at times loses his cool and doesn't focus on the play at
hand. He plays with an edge and is a real agitator, which can be costly at times. He is solid,
allowing him to take hits along the wall. Even after a long shift, he does not quit and drives the
net for scoring chances. He is one of the frst back on the backcheck and his puck possession
is incredible. He plays in all situations and delivers monstrous checks when the time is right.
Covers his check in the defensive zone well and is great at removing players from the puck. "

""He protects the puck well, pressures defensemen well, and comes back hard on the back check,"" said one scout. Hawryluk plays the tough defensive minutes, and projects to be an all-situations player in the NHL. It's unclear whether he has enough offensive skill to be a pro scorer, although he's intriguing in that aspect of the game.",,,,,,,"Hawryluk is a smallish forward who has a good motor, and isn't afraid

gear pretty quickly, putting defensemen on edge. He likes to carry the puck with speed through
the neutral zone and gets off his hard shot whenever he can. He is pretty agile and shows good
balance against pressure. We like how often he seemed to be the aggressor, usually throwing
his weight into oncoming checkers before they could initiate the contact. He works hard in the
corners to maintain possession and continue the cycle, with varied success. He isn't the best
backchecker and we would like to see him have a little bit more determination to get back. He
is a pretty creative player with the puck, fnding different ways to attack the zone, sometimes
opting to stop and shoot or drive wide and take the play to the net. We would like to see him pick
his spots better to fnd open teammates with passes. We like his offensive pizzazz mixed with
an energetic and fearless style. "
2014,LW,72,180,33,STL,,Ivan Barbashev,"Barbashev has been on the prospect radar for several years. He was a top scorer at last year's under-18 championships, was the top overall pick in the CHL Import Draft and received a lot of praise from Russian scouts before he transferred. He's the kind of player who can be set up on the point on a power play, due to the way he can control the puck and see all the options. What makes Barbashev dangerous at even strength is his skill level, but also his intangibles. He's a very hard worker who is plays with a physical edge and can land some crushing blows. He's committed defensively with fine skills on the penalty kill. He needs to get stronger and be a little more consistent offensively, but there aren't a ton of nits to pick with Barbashev.",,,,,,,"Barbashev is a very intriguing prospect who displays a very complete offensive game,
combining size with skill and intelligence to make him a threat each time he has possession of the puck
in the offensive zone. He is also a responsible defensive player whose compete level is very high.
Barbashev moves very well on the ice, especially for someone of his size and strength. His stride is
very effective and he does seem to have a fairly speedy top gear once he gets moving. His balance
is impressive and combined with his size, he is diffcult to separate from the puck when in possession. Barbashev shows excellent poise with the puck. Patience combined with confdence makes
him a threat to be dangerous with the puck in the offensive zone. He does not frequently use
diffcult moves and dekes, but rather uses his reach and body positioning to make it diffcult for
defenders trying to get the puck from him. He has excellent pass-receiving abilities both on his
forehand and backhand, and displays a soft touch while handling the puck. Barbashev likes to
get the puck on net and see where things go from there, an instinct that should transition well
to higher levels of play. Multiple times a game, he throws it on net from unlikely angles in the
hopes of generating rebounds in traffc. Good instincts and hockey sense. His wrist shot has
a quick release, strong accuracy and solid power behind it. He has a solid frame and good
balance on his skates. Finishes his checks well. He is not afraid to engage in physical play
whatsoever and often benefts when the game is more physical due to his preferred style.
He is able to use his size very effciently to protect the puck. A smart player who rarely
makes a bad pass, Barbashev's passes are often on the tape with good velocity, and he
can move the puck very quickly upon receiving it. He is relied upon in all situations and
shows excellent work ethic each time he is on the ice. He plays well in all three zones
and is capable of playing whatever style of play the game requires. Barbashev isn't the most electrifying player and will not get you
out of your seat with fashy moves or plays often, but where he lacks elite-level
skills, he makes up for in his versatility and often with his drive. Acceleration is not
a damning weakness per se, but it is defnitely something he will need to continue
to work on in order to keep up in the professional game. With added strength,
his frst few steps will get more powerful and quicker. Like most kids his age,
he also suffers bouts of inconsistent play and lacking effort away from the
puck. With that said, when he is on his game, there are few better scrappy,
two-way prospects in this draft. He can cross the line of aggressive and dirty
with some of his physical play and gets himself and his team into trouble."
2014,G,76,178,34,CGY,,Mason McDonald,"McDonald is a really toolsy goaltender, with notable upside. When you have a 6-4 prospect with high-end athleticism, you can project that player to be able to make some of the tougher stops in pro hockey. McDonald's lateral quickness is fantastic, and while he hasn't filled out his frame yet (he's 186 pounds), he knows how to get his body in front of pucks. On second efforts, McDonald is solid battling for pucks and he fights through screens well. At times, he can get a little too energetic with his movements, and while he reacts well to moving pucks, he does overcommit occasionally. However, McDonald's hockey IQ and ability to square up pucks are well above average. He is an impressive prospect overall.",,,,,,,"A composed, massive butterfy stopper who is one part blocker and
one part refex stopper. Very calm and cool handling lots of shots and making saves look effortless. Reads the play extremely well and get his big frame in front of shots. Has a very good
glove hand that can steal a goal away in a fash. Cuts down angles well and plays an aggressive
game, coming out to challenge shooters regularly. He is an explosive skater and can just fy
post to post. Closes himself off well and gives shooters very little holes to shoot at. Impressive
rebound control for such a young stopper as he just smothers puck into his arms and chest, and
under his pads. Continued to “grow into his frame” all season – looked athletic and poised with
better limb control in movement as the season progressed. Tracks pucks well. Puck movement
is aggressive and impressive as he helps out the defensemen a lot. Really sewed up his status
as the second-best option in the net and closed the gap on Demko with his performance at the
U18s."
2014,D,74,189,35,TBL,,Dominik Masin,"Masin is a strong two-way defenseman who has impressed at the international level, and was decent in league play, although he was his league's most penalized player. Masin is a heady defender who understands how to position himself on the ice, and anticipates the play well. His stick skills are decent, and his skating is about average as well.",,,,,,,"Captain of the U18 national team who spent the entire year among
juniors, where he was able to use his size fully and develop with as much ice time as they get.
He is a stay-at-home defenseman who doesn't really fail when he goes to the blue line, but his
offensive upside doesn't go beyond the fact that his shot is hard and a bit accurate. His passes
are just okay and so is his carrying of the puck. In his own zone, you will see him use both his
stick and his large frame to steal pucks from opponent's sticks. He's the guy who will do the hard
work back there and protect his goaltender as much as possible. He's a hard worker and has
good leadership abilities. He likes to get into the rough stuff if an opponent crosses the line and
he feels the need to do something."
2014,G,75.75,192,36,VAN,,Thatcher Demko,"The San Diego native had one of the better under-19 seasons in the Hockey East conference in the modern era. He didn't surpass Jon Gillies' tremendous 2012-13 season save percentage (.931), but he did eclipse Cory Schneider's .916 (2004-05) and Jimmy Howard's .916 in 2002-03. He has the natural look of a goalie from a physical standpoint -- 6-foot-4, 192 pounds -- and by how he plays the game, as his high-end positioning and angles leave little room for shooters. He's sound technically, but Demko also has aggressiveness in his game and doesn't shy from challenging shooters. His reactions and quickness in his lower body are solid; he's quite nimble for a big man. According to scouts I've spoken with, Demko can still use some more explosiveness in his push-offs and lateral movements. His tracking of the puck also is a little inconsistent.",,,,,,,"Demko is a big, toolsy goaltender with impressive upside. He shows poise with guys
in front of him for screens and typically does well on breakaways. He challenges the shooter to make
the frst move. In traffc, he tracks the puck very well. If he can see the puck, he will usually stop it. He
does a nice job of challenging the shot, while not giving away the lateral play. Demko knows how to
walk the line between challenging and over-committing. He is a big goalie and naturally takes up a
lot of the net, playing his angles and using his big body very well. He has long legs and takes up a
ton of the net low. His great athleticism and fexibility for a big goalie also helps him make saves he
really has no business making. Being tall not only gives Demko great lower-body stretch, but he
also has a nice wingspan and shows the ability to use both glove and blocker effectively. While
not everything is always caught cleanly, his glove and blocker are typically in the right position
to make the initial save. Demko follows the puck to either side and shows the consistent ability
to get every shot off his blocker side to the corner. He does a great job moving laterally, even
when he is down on the ice. When he is down in the butterfy, he is never really out of position for too long because of the strength in his lower body and powerful push to get back
to where he needs to be. He likes to play the puck with mixed results, but is best when he
simply comes out, stops the puck or lays a short-range breakout or two. His mental game
is usually an asset for him as well. He is extremely mature and was a great leader for that
team, even as a freshman. Like all young stoppers, he does make mistakes, like sitting too far
back in his net or mishandling the puck when he should just leave it for his defense
from time to time. He does not play the puck that often, and when he does, he does
not look too confdent doing so. With that said, there really is not much about his
game that would be classifed as a big weakness. He does not always look comfortable or poised with a lot of people swarming the net while the puck is free and
around his crease. "
2014,G,71.75,190,37,CAR,,Alex Nedeljkovic,"Nedeljkovic had one of the best starts to an OHL career I can remember for a goalie in terms of performance. He essentially has every tool except for size (6-0, 183 pounds). His athleticism is top-end; his quickness, side-to-side movements and reflexes allow him to make a lot of tough stops other goalies don't make. While he has those dynamic qualities, he remains effective in net in terms of reads and patience with his depth. He battles well on loose pucks, and gives good second efforts. His main weakness is that due to his size, he appears to lose the puck in traffic and be prone to the odd soft goal here and there that goes high on him. He also can be a little too kick-happy, leading to big rebounds.",,,,,,," An athletic, but “small” stopper based on today's goaltender size standards, Nedeljkovic nevertheless just stops pucks. Has impressive refexes and quickness that
can't be taught. He moves along the goal line very well, and never loses track of the play. Has
good hands as well, using both his blocker and glove to make saves on shots marked for the
corners. His quickness and ability to recover is impressive, and he is solid positionally and
shows great composure. Very effective puck handler as well, keeping the play moving and even
setting up a few decent breakouts for his team each game. He was good on his rebound control
and his ability to see through traffc to make the frst save almost automatic. Poised and mature
beyond his years, a calming infuence on the team in front of him. Never gives up and battles
until the puck is covered, cleared or it gets by him. One issue to improve upon is his positioning
as he can get caught sitting too far back in his crease, leaving a lot of room that NHL shooters
will have no problem hitting."
2014,D,76,167,38,ANA,,Marcus Pettersson,"Pettersson recently converted to defense from forward, and there are understandably raw elements in his game due to his transition, but he's also an intriguing player due to his upside and how he's tracking. Pettersson has quick feet, overall good range for a defender and skates very well for a big man (6-foot-3, 161 pounds). His skill and offensive instincts are still evident from his forward days, as he moves the puck well and can join the attack. His defensive sense and reads are a significant work in progress. Pettersson can struggle with gap control and containing the better forwards. Despite being a big guy, he's not the toughest on his checks and needs to work on his strength.",,,,,,,"Pettersson is an impressively mobile defender for his size. He moves
well and is able to get around effectively. He is strong on the puck and uses his strength to protect it from pressure. The tall, lanky defenseman shows strong puck-moving abilities and poise.
Pettersson can skate the puck out of trouble and makes a good frst pass out of his own zone.
He is a powerful shooter from the point and boasts a quick, heavy shot that he'll use on the power play. Defensively, Pettersson is physical down low and he isn't afraid to use his size. He does
need to work on his anticipation in his own end, as he often steps up too soon or too late and
gets beat. He is, at times, far too aggressive on defense and loses track of position and where
he is in the zone. Pettersson needs to work on flling out his frame. The potential is there for
Pettersson to be a really good defenseman at the pro level. He should go in the middle rounds."
2014,G,73,181,39,WSH,,Vitek Vanecek,,,,,,,,"Vanacek is an athletic goaltender who is well aware of what he's got
and is willing to use all that in order to make his opposition suffer from lack of goals. His movements in the crease are exceptional, maybe even the best in the entire draft class. His refexes
are top-notch and he uses his quick body to make even the most diffcult saves. He uses all his
equipment properly, has a quick glove and a solid blocker, and is good down low as well. What
he should work on is the mental side of his game as he proved a little too inconsistent this season. Also, I don't believe he's good enough handling the puck. It also appears to me that he's not
the hardest worker off the ice, but he sure has a gift and that means a lot. Doesn't always deliver
under huge pressure, but that might be coincidence as he seems a little too relaxed off the ice."
2014,D,75,190,40,OTT,,Andreas Englund,"Englund spent some time in both the junior and professional ranks this season, playing very well in the second half and was good for Sweden at the international under-18 level as well. He's physically intriguing at 6-3, 190 pounds, especially when considering he uses his body well to win puck battles, and at times land some crushing physical blows. He's certainly a quality penalty killer who can make stops, and at even strength his sense allows him to check tougher players. Englund's puck moving is decent, but he'll never be confused for a puck wizard.",,,,,,,"A two-way defenseman who is more physical than technical, Englund
is solid in his own zone and pretty dangerous on the opposing blueline. Englund demonstrates
impressive mobility and speed. He is a powerful skater and gets going quickly. He is balanced
and controlled on his skates, and can move well for his size. He demonstrates strength on the
puck and the ability to escape pressure in his own zone. Englund makes a good frst pass and
sends his team quickly up ice with quick outlets. He is a little too aggressive at times in his own
zone, but he was mostly smart with his decision making. He takes space away quickly and isn't
afraid to use his body to take a man off the puck. He contains his man well and is strong against
some bigger forwards. He shuts players down well with his size and is impressive down low in
his own end, with the ability to win pucks and earn his team possession. Englund edges out
opposing forwards well into the corners. Very strong and harsh on opponents in front of the net.
Can be very tenacious, especially in those little one-on-one battles."
